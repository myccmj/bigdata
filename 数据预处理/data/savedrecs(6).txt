AB We investigated whether the adaptation of postural control to perform saccadic tasks is still maintained in challenging situations such as when the posture is challenged with a large movement of the moving room and with the addition of a second perturbation as a visual task of memorization. Thirty young adults (20.0 +/- 1.3 years) were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. Participants stood upright on a force plate inside a moving room wearing eye-tracking. The room moved back and forth (anterior-posterior direction), at low (.6 cm-first and third trials) and high (3.5 cm-second trial) amplitude, and frequency of .2 Hz. In each trial, participants performed left-right horizontal saccades on a target (1.1 Hz). The experimental group also performed a concomitant number memorization task. There were no differences between groups in the coupling between center of pressure (CoP) displacements and visual stimulus in any condition. There was also no difference in the performance of the saccadic task. In the memorization task, CoP displacements in response to the visual stimulus frequency (room motion) were not affected. The performance in the memorization task was similar between room conditions. Overall, increasing cognitive involvement by adding a working memory task does not deteriorate the postural stabilization of young adults to accomplish accurate gaze shifts. Also, it does not interfere with adaptive visual reweighting due to changes in the moving room amplitude. In conclusion, young adults are flexible in optimizing their postural control to succeed in multiple tasks even under perturbation.

ID MALWARE DETECTION; FRAMEWORK
AB Implementing the necessary countermeasures to detect the growing and highly destructive family of malware is an urgent obligation. The proliferation and diversity of malware make these problems more challenging. For beginners, it is arduous to attain crucial features for multi-class family classification and extract valuable information from the obtained features. Another issue is that building a classification model that effectively absorbs multi-class samples and adapts to various features is challenging. This work indicates a precise identification method for Android application families (ANDF) to tackle these issues. It perceptively analyzes the features that multi-class families can utilize to identify members and further excavates the relationship between implicit information and the severity of those distinctions. A more appropriate classification model is developed for the heterogeneous file formats, and a more beneficial feature with a diverse array of heterogeneous information is chosen as the replacement representation of the sample. It is capable of upgrading learning ability and mastering the multi-modal traits of the family malware. The application of ANDF to real data sets yields effective classification results. It is capable of 0.9800 in f1-macro and has a classification accuracy of 98.61%. It performs, respectively, 0.0088 points better than the two-feature comparison classification model and 0.0872 points better than the single-feature comparison classification model. The kappa coefficient can also exceed 0.9830, which is at least 0.1044 higher than other contrasting classifiers and is 0.0105 greater than that of the contrasted model containing two features, which is 0.1046 larger than the classifier with a contrasting single feature.

   constraints; Pseudo-Boolean constraints; Linear constraints
AB Many constraint satisfaction and optimisation problems can be solved effectively by encoding them as instances of the Boolean Satisfiability problem (SAT). However, even the simplest types of constraints have many encodings in the literature with widely varying performance, and the problem of selecting suitable encodings for a given problem instance is not trivial. We explore the problem of selecting encodings for pseudo-Boolean and linear constraints using a supervised machine learning approach. We show that it is possible to select encodings effectively using a standard set of features for constraint problems; however we obtain better performance with a new set of features specifically designed for the pseudo-Boolean and linear constraints. In fact, we achieve good results when selecting encodings for unseen problem classes. Our results compare favourably to AutoFolio when using the same feature set. We discuss the relative importance of instance features to the task of selecting the best encodings, and compare several variations of the machine learning method.

AB Research on time series online modeling has received much attention in recent years. The existing advanced methods are often accompanied by the problem of low model established efficiency, so it is difficult to realize online modeling in practical applications. This paper proposed a sequence decomposition learning networks (SDLN) to solve time series online forecasting problems. In contrast to most time series forecasting methods, SDLN is a novel time series online forecasting method without capturing sliding time window features. The SDLN consists of five layers of neurons, namely, the input layer, decomposition layer, sparse layer, hidden layer, and output layer, where the additions of the decomposition layer and sparse layer enable a fast model calculation speed and do not require the capture of sliding time window features. In addition, it can establish time series forecasting models with better model accuracy and model stability in a very short model calculation time. To verify the effectiveness of SDLN, eight publicly available time series datasets are applied. Experimental results show that SDLN can obtain better model performance than other state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of model computation speed. It can achieve a model accuracy of 10-4 to 10-2 and a model computation time of 10-2 seconds for short-and medium-term forecasting on all eight datasets. Therefore, SDLN is an effective time series online modeling method.

AB Despite a large amount of research into task-oriented dialogue systems, open-ended dialogue agents have received little attention. Recently, researchers have explored using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to build such models, however, these require extensive computation and data. This paper propose MidGAN to address prior limitations of GAN-based dialogue models. It does this by trying to maximize the mutual information of the responses generated by the model. To this end, we propose a new metric, MMI-Like. This is based on Maximizing Mutual Information (MMI), yet unlike MMI, does not rely on an auxiliary generative model. We evaluate MidGAN based on the diversity, informativeness by measuring similarity and relevance of the responses it generates by BLEU metric. Our evaluation results, based on the three benchmark datasets, show that MidGAN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art framework, ADV.

AB In practical problems, some partial differential equations defined in high-dimensional domains or complex surfaces are difficult to calculate by traditional methods. In this paper, a novel data-driven deep learning algorithm is proposed to solve high-dimensional convection-diffusion-reaction equations. The main idea of the method is to use the neural network which combines the physical characteristics of the equation to get high accuracy numerical solution. The proposed method not only avoids the high cost of mesh generation, but also effectively reduces the numerical oscillation caused by the domination of the convection. In addition, two types of loss functions are designed to force physical properties, such as the positivity or maximum principle of the solution. Various numerical examples are performed to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of the proposed method.

DE Possible/necessary similarity measure; Interval-valued fuzzy set; Early
   depression diagnosis
ID SUBSETHOOD MEASURES; FUZZY; AGGREGATION; UNCERTAINTY
AB The first primary motivation of this paper is to propose new methods for measuring similarity between interval -valued fuzzy sets based on an order relation of the intervals, which are a possible and necessary similarity measure. To capture the basic idea of the suggested approach, one has to realize that an interval-valued fuzzy set (IVFS) can be considered as a family of closed intervals describing imprecise information, or uncertainty, on the possible belongingness of each element of the universe of discourse and the dependence between them. Consequently, any relation between two interval-valued fuzzy sets could be analyzed using the links between the corresponding families of intervals. The core of the proposed methodology is based on the description of possible and necessary inclusion and the width of the corresponding intervals in epistemic issues, i.e. optimistic (possible) and pessimistic (necessary) measures. Our second motivation is to use our concept of measures to early detect the risk of depressive episodes among students tested for this research. We propose an effective algorithm to estimate the risk of depressive episodes. By using machine learning methods concerning uncertainty, we obtained more sensitivity to diagnosis compared to the currently used tests, e.g., CESD-R. We aim to identify the risk of depressive states before they are indicated in other tests such as CESD-R, which can prevent the appearance of symptoms after early medical consultation. In the initial study, we were able to achieve a 4-week faster diagnosis of at-risk depression in 20% of subjects who had CESD-R at risk, so we are talking about a more sensitive test, in this sense, as a result of this work. The proposed methodology, in the form of a system, will be used in medical centers by general practitioners or entrepreneurs for their subordinates to eliminate depression-related breaks at an early prevention stage.

AB Deep clustering generally obtains promising performance by learning deep feature representations. However, there are two limitations: specialIntscript end-to-end deep density clustering needs to be explored; specialIntscript prior information is ignored to guide the learning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep density clustering (SDDC). Specifically, a convolutional autoencoder is applied to learn embedded features, and semi-supervised density peaks clustering is designed to identify stable cluster centers. Meanwhile, prior information is introduced to instruct the preferable clustering process. By integrating prior information, a joint clustering loss is directly built on embedded features to perform feature representation and cluster assignment simultaneously. Extensive experiments validate the power of SDDC for initializing and the effectiveness on clustering tasks.

AB In search-attack and search-rescue tasks performed by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV), cooperative search plays an important part. The majority of approaches in use today assume that the UAV swarm's communication network is complete. However, these links are susceptible to environmental changes or adversary interference. Aiming at cooperative search in search-attack and search-rescue tasks, we propose a distributed cooperative search method for multi-UAV with unstable communications (DCS-UC), which is developed based on ant colony optimization (ACO). The proposed method presents three algorithms to enable the UAV swarm to conduct online cooperative search efficiently and safely. First, a pheromone matrix consensus update technique for usage in ACO is designed under switching and connected topology graphs. This approach can help each UAV's pheromone matrix achieve consensus, improving the UAV swarm's cooperative efficiency. Then, a position consensus update algorithm is presented where the position vector, including the positions of all the UAVs in each UAV, can achieve consensus under switching and connected topology graphs. Finally, a collision avoidance algorithm is developed using the determined consistent positions of all the UAVs to address the issue of collision avoidance for all the UAVs. This approach enables the UAV swarm to conduct cooperative search safely. Results from extensive physical simulations performed in Gazebo confirm the benefits of the proposed multi-UAV cooperative search method.

ID ELECTROCARDIOGRAM SIGNALS; LEARNING APPROACH; DIAGNOSIS
AB Atrial fibrillation (AFIB) and ventricular fibrillation (VFIB) are two common cardiovascular diseases that cause numerous deaths worldwide. Medical staff usually adopt long-term ECGs as a tool to diagnose AFIB and VFIB. However, since ECG changes are occasionally subtle and similar, visual observation of ECG changes is challenging. To address this issue, we proposed a multi-angle dual-channel fusion network (MDF-Net) to automatically recognize AFIB and VFIB heartbeats in this work. MDF-Net can be seen as the fusion of a task-related component analysis (TRCA)-principal component analysis (PCA) network (TRPC-Net), a canonical correlation analysis (CCA)-PCA network (CPC-Net), and the linear support vector machine-weighted softmax with average (LS-WSA) method. TRPC-Net and CPC-Net are employed to extract deep task-related and correlation features, respectively, from two-lead ECGs, by which multi-angle feature-level information fusion is realized. Since the convolution kernels of the above methods can be directly extracted through TRCA, CCA and PCA technologies, their training time is faster than that of convolutional neural networks. Finally, LS-WSA is employed to fuse the above features at the decision level, by which the classification results are obtained. In distinguishing AFIB and VFIB heartbeats, the proposed method achieved accuracies of 99.39 % and 97.17 % in intra- and inter-patient experiments, respectively. In addition, this method performed well on noisy data and extremely imbalanced data, in which abnormal heatbeats are much less than normal heartbeats. Our proposed method has the potential to be used as a diagnostic tool in the clinic.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology, smart homes have gradually become an integral part of people's lives, and the market share of smart homes has experienced a significant surge in recent years. As a result, there is a growing need for both producers and end-users to evaluate the intelligence of smart homes. While existing studies focus on simulating smart home environments, they do not provide an approach for automatically evaluating the intelligence of smart homes. In this study, we systematically establish a conceptual model of smart homes based on a wide range of smart home definitions, focusing on examining the factors that contribute to users feeling satisfied with their smart homes. Additionally, we proposed a framework for evaluating the intelligence capability of smart homes. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we conducted an empirical study using an online user survey and collected 300 questionnaires about user ratings of three smart home suites. Our empirical results demonstrate that our framework is consistent with users' perceptions of the intelligence level of smart homes. In order to further explore why users feel satisfied with their smart homes, we held a workshop with five participants. The results of our discussion showed a correlation between why users feel satisfied with their smart homes and the user needs that smart homes can fulfill.

AB With the increasing digitalization of health data, patients need to make informed decisions about the online sharing of their protected health information. This necessitates a robust technical infrastructure that enables patients to self-manage consent and the trusted exchange of this information across sharing entities. Unfortunately, current health information exchange systems in the U.S. are limited in both these regards. While there is recent work on digital patient consent management, there is limited work that provides effective solutions for patient self-management of consent. Further, interoperability issues in the way health information exchanges are currently architected and differences in regulations across localities exacerbate the challenges of consent management. In this research, we survey potential patients' willingness to self-manage healthcare-related consent. Having established the desire for consent self-management, we propose a solution that enables the seamless sharing of patient consent across different healthcare providers and health information exchanges. Specifically, we use a rigorous design science approach to create a blockchain-based, self-managed patient consent system and we evaluate the design through an instantiated prototype. The results of our study should be useful to researchers in healthcare information management as well as to practitioners designing consent management systems. Our research contributes to design science research with an innovative, rigorously evaluated, design principles-based artifact that addresses a critical problem of sharing protected health information.

AB The current governance model of gig platform ecosystems benefits gig platforms and customers, but puts gig workers in the weakest position of the triangular relationship. Thus, gig workers experience difficulty in addressing hardships related to gig work. To this end, we must determine how gig platforms build a governance environment that matches gig workers to help them craft gig work. However, extant studies have remained in the qualitative research surface, lacked a certain empirical insight, and have not clarified the direction to creating an effective platform governance model. Thus, based on such literature, we first conceptualize platform formalization governance. Drawing on person-environment fit theory, the PLS-SEM analysis of 290 data from gig workers finds that platform formalization governance directly promotes gig workers' job crafting and indirectly propels it by improving performance appraisal systems' transparency. However, platform work insecurity climate weakens such an direct/indirect positive relationship. These findings contribute to strategic values and effectiveness of the governance model of gig platform ecosystems, thus balancing interests between gig platforms, gig workers, and customers. Gig platforms should consider appropriately formalizing the current governance model and improving work insecurity climate, which helps gig workers more easily address hardships associated with platform work through job crafting.

DE Human keypoint detection; Human pose estimation; Data augmentation
AB When estimating human pose with a partial image of a person, we, humans, do not confine the spatial range of our estimation to the given image and can readily localize keypoints outside of the image by referring to visual clues such as the body size. However, computational methods for human pose estimation do not consider those keypoints outside and focus only on the bounded area of a given image. In this paper, we propose a neural network and a data augmentation method to extend the range of human pose estimation beyond the bounding box. While our Position Puzzle Network expands the spatial range of keypoint localization by refining the position and the size of the target's bounding box, Position Puzzle Augmentation enables the keypoint detector to estimate keypoints not only within, but also beyond the input image. We show that the proposed method enhances the baseline keypoint detectors by 39.5% and 30.5% on average in mAP and mAR, respectively, by enabling the localization of keypoints out of the bounding box using a cropped image dataset prepared for proper evaluation. Additionally, we verify that the proposed method does not degrade the performance under the original benchmarks and instead, improves the performance by alleviating false-positive errors.

ID PARKINSONS-DISEASE
AB Time series data continuously collected by different sensors play an essential role in monitoring and predicting events in many real-world applications, and anomaly detection for time series has received increasing attention during the past decades. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method by densely contrasting the whole time series with its sub-sequences at different timestamps in a latent space. Our approach leverages the locality property of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and integrates position embedding to effectively capture local features for sub-sequences. Simultaneously, we employ an attention mechanism to extract global features from the entire time series. By combining these local and global features, our model is trained using both instance-level contrastive learning loss and distribution-level alignment loss. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction loss applied to the extracted global features to prevent the potential loss of information. To validate the efficacy of our proposed technique, we conduct experiments on publicly available time-series datasets for anomaly detection. Additionally, we evaluate our method on an in-house mobile phone dataset aimed at monitoring the status of Parkinson's disease, all within an unsupervised learning framework. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed approach in tackling anomaly detection in time series data, offering promising applications in real-world scenarios.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown remarkable performance in processing graph-structured data by leveraging neighborhood information for node representation learning. While most GCN models assume strong homophily within the networks they handle, some models can also handle heterophilous graphs. However, the selection of neighbors participating in the node representation learning process can significantly impact these models' performance. To address this, we investigate the influence of neighbor selection on GCN performance, focusing on the analysis of edge distribution through theoretical and empirical approaches. Based on our findings, we propose a novel GCN model called Graph Convolution Network with Improved Edge Distribution (GCN-IED). GCN-IED incorporates both direct edges, which rely on local neighborhood similarity, and hidden edges, obtained by aggregating information from multi-hop neighbors. We extensively evaluate GCN-IED on diverse graph benchmark datasets and observe its superior performance compared to other stateof-the-art GCN methods on heterophilous datasets. Our GCN-IED model, which considers the role of neighbors and optimizes edge distribution, provides valuable insights for enhancing graph representation learning and achieving superior performance on heterophilous graphs.

AB The main aim of multimodal multiobjective optimization algorithms is to find multiple optimal solutions for multiple objectives. The problem with multiple objectives is to maintain the diversity and convergence balance in both decision and objective space. Better performance in one space can lead to deterioration of performance in another space. To effectively perform exploration and exploitation in the decision space, we have proposed a niching technique in our proposed algorithm based on differential evolution to form groups of the population. The niching technique also incorporates a balancing strategy to average the size of niches and a generation strategy to add new elements by finding promising areas. We have also proposed an archive strategy to store the possible optimal solutions that help to explore the decision space and ensure diversity as well as the convergence of the solutions. To show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we have performed exhaustive experimentation on the benchmark test suite and compared the results with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results obtained using the proposed algorithm highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in both decision and objective space.

AB Plugin hybrid electric buses (PHEB) are nowadays an essential technology for the decarbonization of cities, proposing a more flexible solution than fully electric buses. There are a few studies for the design of operational strategies for PHEBs (i.e., to choose the propulsion method to use along the route) to minimize tailpipe emissions and/or maximize the electric range of the bus. However, all of them offer static strategies that cannot dynamically adapt to unforeseen traffic events, which can significantly impact on the performance of the bus. In this work, we propose modeling the problem of finding optimal PHEB operational strategies as a classification problem, allowing the generation of pseudo-optimal strategies in very short computational times. The method designed, called ML-EPBO, takes decisions based on local information of the bus, as well as from the route, so it can adapt to any events causing unexpected traffic conditions. Neuroevolution is used in this work to fine-tune ML-EPBO for optimal performance. Results show how ML-EPBO instantly offer solutions highly competitive with the best existing techniques in the literature, which do not offer the possibility of dynamically adapting to unexpected traffic events because they make use of global knowledge of the problem and have high computational complexity. Indeed, the average accuracy value obtained by the model is over 99.2%, and the strategies proposed are predicted over 70% of the cases with 100% of accuracy, even outperforming the state of the art results by up to 4.7% in the level of emissions or 1.82% in the electric range.

AB When data mining research is conducted, it is difficult to obtain precise domain knowledge to set a similarity threshold. Furthermore, noise and missing values are inevitable. Missing values and noise without preprocessing are challenges for many algorithms. A time-series clustering method is proposed based on the normal cloud model and complex networks. Matrix profile similarity measurement, normal cloud model generation and filtering, cloud model expectation curve weighting, degree centrality reweighting, and community discovery in complex networks are the five stages of the proposed clustering algorithm. Local features are considered, and the effects of missing values are reduced when performing similarity measurements. The normal cloud model can be used to set thresholds adaptively. The Louvain algorithm accomplishes the clustering task in complex networks without specifying the clusters. Experiments are conducted on 94 datasets and are compared with 8 clustering methods in the UCR time-series clustering benchmark study. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can perform well on many datasets.

AB Recently Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) has become a prominent tool for processing the datasets with preference order. However, DSRA requires calculating lower and upper approximations, which are computationally expensive. We have proposed a computationally efficient approximation calculation method that traverses each item in the dataset and updates the lower and upper approximations according to their preference order. In this way, there is no need to traverse the dataset multiple times, which not only enhances the performance but also produces the same results as produced by the conventional approach. Results on ten benchmark datasets from UCI have shown that the proposed approach significantly reduces the average computation time, that is, 19.5% in the case of lower approximation and 11% in the case of upper approximation. Memory consumption is also reduced by 99%. This clearly shows the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Home Health Care (HHC) services have emerged as a result of the need to provide care to patients/people who cannot be treated in hospital due to their special conditions and/or need home care. The care and treatment processes provided by this service have been appreciated by researchers as they can be less expensive and just as effective than care provided by a hospital or a skilled care facility. HHC gains importance due to the increasing epidemic disease cases, the increase in the elderly population, etc. In this study, it is aimed to provide high quality service as well as minimizing travel costs by considering the constraints related to travel balancing and type of transportation vehicle. So, environmental and economic factors could be included in the model. The proposed Home Health Care Routing Problem with Health Team Skill Level (HTSL-HHCRP) model was coded in GAMS 24.2.1 software. A new hybrid method named as Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing-Marine Pred-ators Algorithm (GASA-MPA) has been developed to solve the large dimensions of the problem. In hybrid approach, SA has been used with an initial point obtained by GA. On the other hand, feasibility of the neigh-borhood solutions is guaranteed by solving a constraint satisfaction problem via MPA. Test problems' perfor-mance was analyzed using the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) evaluation criteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the results according to some parameters selected by scenario analysis was examined. Results confirm the effi-ciency of the GASA-MPA algorithm in terms of time and objective function. Furthermore, by addressing skill levels of the healthcare team, it is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than more traditional evolutionary algorithms in HHCRP. The comparisons show that the proposed method outperformed the classical methods not only in terms of best solution, but also the Gap (%) and RDI values.

AB Kidney transplantation can significantly enhance living standards for people suffering from end-stage renal disease. A significant factor that affects graft survival time (the time until the transplant fails and the patient requires another transplant) for kidney transplantation is the compatibility of the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) between the donor and recipient. In this paper, we propose 4 new biologically-relevant feature representations for incorporating HLA information into machine learning-based survival analysis algorithms. We evaluate our proposed HLA feature representations on a database of over 100,000 transplants and find that they improve prediction accuracy by about 1%, modest at the patient level but potentially significant at a societal level. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve transplant survival outcomes, enabling better allocation of donors to recipients and reducing the number of re-transplants due to graft failure with poorly matched donors.

AB The central arterial pressure (CAP) is an important physiological indicator of the human cardiovascular system which represents one of the greatest threats to human health. Accurate non-invasive detection and reconstruction of CAP waveforms are crucial for the reliable treatment of cardiovascular system diseases. However, the traditional methods are reconstructed with relatively low accuracy, and some deep learning neural network models also have difficulty in extracting features, as a result, these methods have potential for further advancement. In this study, we proposed a novel model (CBi-SAN) to implement an end-to -end relationship from radial artery pressure (RAP) waveform to CAP waveform, which consisted of the convolutional neural network (CNN), the bidirectional long-short-time memory network (BiLSTM), and the self -attention mechanism to improve the performance of CAP reconstruction. The data on invasive measurements of CAP and RAP waveform were used in 62 patients before and after medication to develop and validate the performance of CBi-SAN model for reconstructing CAP waveform. We compared it with traditional methods and deep learning models in mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). Study results indicated the CBi-SAN model performed great performance on CAP waveform reconstruction (MAE: 2.23 +/- 0.11 mmHg, RMSE: 2.21 +/- 0.07 mmHg), concurrently, the best reconstruction effect was obtained in the central artery systolic pressure (CASP) and the central artery diastolic pressure(CADP) (RMSECASP: 2.94 +/- 0.48 mmHg, RMSECADP: 1.96 +/- 0.06 mmHg). These results implied the performance of the CAP reconstruction based on CBi-SAN model was superior to the existing methods, hopped to be effectively applied to clinical practice in the future.

AB Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is an important risk analysis tool that has been widely used in diverse areas to manage risk factors. However, how to manage the uncertainty in FMEA assessments is still an open issue. In this paper, a novel FMEA model based on the improved pignistic probability transformation function in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DST) and grey relational projection method (GRPM) is proposed to improve the accuracy and reliability in risk analysis with FMEA. The basic probability assignment (BPA) function in DST is used to model the assessments of experts with respect to each risk factor. Dempster's rule of combination is adopted for fusion of assessment information from different experts. The improved pignistic probability function is proposed and used to transform the fusion result of BPA into probability function for getting more accurate decision-making result in risk analysis with FMEA. GRPM is adopted to determine the risk priority order of all the failure modes to overcome the shortcoming in traditional risk priority number in FMEA. Applications in aircraft turbine rotor blades and steel production process are presented to show the rationality and generality of the proposed method.

AB Mobile devices have become increasingly prevalent in the context of consumers' offline search and shopping behavior by acting as personal decision support tools. This paper investigates the relationship between consumers' real-time location and their search behavior when shopping offline. We develop two location-specific measures based on mobile device usage to analyze the association between a consumer's real-time location and their search behavior: Present store distance and present store density. We apply these measures to a unique dataset from a leading mobile product information app that includes >13 million search sessions from 2.5 million consumers searching for 1.8 million different products. Our findings show that store distance and store density significantly influence consumers' mobile search behavior: detailed searches for product-specific attributes (search depth) increase as store distance decreases and store density increases, while the number of jointly searched products within the same category (search breadth) increases as store distance and density increase. We also find that durable products weaken the main effects of store distance and density on search depth but strengthen it for search breadth.

AB Self-attention mechanisms and non-local blocks have become crucial building blocks for state-of-the-art neural architectures thanks to their unparalleled ability in capturing long-range dependencies in the input. However their cost is quadratic with the number of spatial positions hence making their use impractical in many real case applications. In this work, we analyze these methods through a polynomial lens, and we show that self-attention can be seen as a special case of a 3 rd order polynomial. Within this polynomial framework, we are able to design polynomial operators capable of accessing the same data pattern of non-local and self-attention blocks while reducing the complexity from quadratic to linear. As a result, we propose two modules (Poly-NL and Poly-SA) that can be used as "drop-in" replacements for more-complex non-local and self-attention layers in state-of-the-art CNNs and ViT architectures. Our modules can achieve comparable, if not better, performance across a wide range of computer vision tasks while keeping a complexity equivalent to a standard linear layer.

TI Token Selection is a Simple Booster for Vision Transformers

AB Vision transformers have recently attained state-of-the-art results in visual recognition tasks. Their success is largely attributed to the self-attention component, which models the global dependencies among the image patches (tokens) and aggregates them into higher-level features. However, self-attention brings significant training difficulties to ViTs. Many recent works thus develop various new self-attention components to alleviate this issue. In this article, instead of developing complicated self-attention mechanism, we aim to explore simple approaches to fully release the potential of the vanilla self-attention. We first study the token selection behavior of self-attention and find that it suffers from a low diversity due to attention over-smoothing, which severely limits its effectiveness in learning discriminative token features. We then develop simple approaches to enhance selectivity and diversity for self-attention in token selection. The resulted token selector module can server as a drop-in module for various ViT backbones and consistently boost their performance. Significantly, they enable ViTs to achieve 84.6% top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet with only 25M parameters. When scaled up to 81M parameters, the result can be further improved to 86.1%. In addition, we also present comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the token selector can be applied to a variety of transformer-based models to boost their performance for image classification, semantic segmentation and NLP tasks.

   Computer architecture; Ducts; Attention; computer vision; convolution;

AB It is uncertain whether the power of transformer architectures can complement existing convolutional neural networks. A few recent attempts have combined convolution with transformer design through a range of structures in series, where the main contribution of this paper is to explore a parallel design approach. While previous transformed-based approaches need to segment the image into patch-wise tokens, we observe that the multi-head self-attention conducted on convolutional features is mainly sensitive to global correlations and that the performance degrades when these correlations are not exhibited. We propose two parallel modules along with multi-head self-attention to enhance the transformer. For local information, a dynamic local enhancement module leverages convolution to dynamically and explicitly enhance positive local patches and suppress the response to less informative ones. For mid-level structure, a novel unary co-occurrence excitation module utilizes convolution to actively search the local co-occurrence between patches. The parallel-designed Dynamic Unary Convolution in Transformer (DUCT) blocks are aggregated into a deep architecture, which is comprehensively evaluated across essential computer vision tasks in image-based classification, segmentation, retrieval and density estimation. Both qualitative and quantitative results show our parallel convolutional-transformer approach with dynamic and unary convolution outperforms existing series-designed structures.

AB Recently, the vision transformer has achieved great success by pushing the state-of-the-art of various vision tasks. One of the most challenging problems in the vision transformer is that the large sequence length of image tokens leads to high computational cost (quadratic complexity). A popular solution to this problem is to use a single pooling operation to reduce the sequence length. This paper considers how to improve existing vision transformers, where the pooled feature extracted by a single pooling operation seems less powerful. To this end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective in various vision tasks owing to its powerful ability in context abstraction. However, pyramid pooling has not been explored in backbone network design. To bridge this gap, we propose to adapt pyramid pooling to Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in the vision transformer, simultaneously reducing the sequence length and capturing powerful contextual features. Plugged with our pooling-based MHSA, we build a universal vision transformer backbone, dubbed Pyramid Pooling Transformer (P2T). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when applied P2T as the backbone network, it shows substantial superiority in various vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, compared to previous CNN- and transformer-based networks. The code will be released at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/P2T.

AB Tracking a time-varying indefinite number of objects in a video sequence over time remains a challenge despite recent advances in the field. Most existing approaches are not able to properly handle multi-object tracking challenges such as occlusion, in part because they ignore long-term temporal information. To address these shortcomings, we present MO3TR: a truly end-to-end Transformer-based online multi-object tracking (MOT) framework that learns to handle occlusions, track initiation and termination without the need for an explicit data association module or any heuristics. MO3TR encodes object interactions into long-term temporal embeddings using a combination of spatial and temporal Transformers, and recursively uses the information jointly with the input data to estimate the states of all tracked objects over time. The spatial attention mechanism enables our framework to learn implicit representations between all the objects and the objects to the measurements, while the temporal attention mechanism focuses on specific parts of past information, allowing our approach to resolve occlusions over multiple frames. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of this new approach, achieving results on par with or better than the current state-of-the-art on multiple MOT metrics for several popular multi-object tracking benchmarks.

AB Training state-of-the-art models for human pose estimation in videos requires datasets with annotations that are really hard and expensive to obtain. Although transformers have been recently utilized for body pose sequence modeling, related methods rely on pseudo-ground truth to augment the currently limited training data available for learning such models. In this paper, we introduce PoseBERT, a transformer module that is fully trained on 3D Motion Capture (MoCap) data via masked modeling. It is simple, generic and versatile, as it can be plugged on top of any image-based model to transform it in a video-based model leveraging temporal information. We showcase variants of PoseBERT with different inputs varying from 3D skeleton keypoints to rotations of a 3D parametric model for either the full body (SMPL) or just the hands (MANO). Since PoseBERT training is task agnostic, the model can be applied to several tasks such as pose refinement, future pose prediction or motion completion without finetuning. Our experimental results validate that adding PoseBERT on top of various state-of-the-art pose estimation methods consistently improves their performances, while its low computational cost allows us to use it in a real-time demo for smoothly animating a robotic hand via a webcam. Test code and models are available at https://github.com/naver/posebert.

AB New classes arise frequently in our ever-changing world, e.g., emerging topics in social media and new types of products in e-commerce. A model should recognize new classes and meanwhile maintain discriminability over old classes. Under severe circumstances, only limited novel instances are available to incrementally update the model. The task of recognizing few-shot new classes without forgetting old classes is called few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL). In this work, we propose a new paradigm for FSCIL based on meta-learning by LearnIng Multi-phase Incremental Tasks (Limit), which synthesizes fake FSCIL tasks from the base dataset. The data format of fake tasks is consistent with the 'real' incremental tasks, and we can build a generalizable feature space for the unseen tasks through meta-learning. Besides, Limit also constructs a calibration module based on transformer, which calibrates the old class classifiers and new class prototypes into the same scale and fills in the semantic gap. The calibration module also adaptively contextualizes the instance-specific embedding with a set-to-set function. Limit efficiently adapts to new classes and meanwhile resists forgetting over old classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CUB200) and large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validate that Limit achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB Few-shot object detection has been extensively investigated by incorporating meta-learning into region-based detection frameworks. Despite its success, the said paradigm is still constrained by several factors, such as (i) low-quality region proposals for novel classes and (ii) negligence of the inter-class correlation among different classes. Such limitations hinder the generalization of base-class knowledge for the detection of novel-class objects. In this work, we design Meta-DETR, which (i) is the first image-level few-shot detector, and (ii) introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to capture and leverage the correlation among different classes for robust and accurate few-shot object detection. Meta-DETR works entirely at image level without any region proposals, which circumvents the constraint of inaccurate proposals in prevalent few-shot detection frameworks. In addition, the introduced correlational meta-learning enables Meta-DETR to simultaneously attend to multiple support classes within a single feedforward, which allows to capture the inter-class correlation among different classes, thus significantly reducing the misclassification over similar classes and enhancing knowledge generalization to novel classes. Experiments over multiple few-shot object detection benchmarks show that the proposed Meta-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. The implementation codes are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR.

AB Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be considered as a sequence modeling task, where an agent employs a sequence of past state-action-reward experiences to predict a sequence of future actions. In this work, we propose State-Action-Reward Transformer (StARformer), a Transformer architecture for robot learning with image inputs, which explicitly models short-term state-action-reward representations (StAR-representations), essentially introducing a Markovian-like inductive bias to improve long-term modeling. StARformer first extracts StAR-representations using self-attending patches of image states, action, and reward tokens within a short temporal window. These StAR-representations are combined with pure image state representations, extracted as convolutional features, to perform self-attention over the whole sequence. Our experimental results show that StARformer outperforms the state-of-the-art Transformer-based method on image-based Atari and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks, under both offline-RL and imitation learning settings. We find that models can benefit from our combination of patch-wise and convolutional image embeddings. StARformer is also more compliant with longer sequences of inputs than the baseline method. Finally, we demonstrate how StARformer can be successfully applied to a real-world robot imitation learning setting via a human-following task.

AB How should we integrate representations from complementary sensors for autonomous driving? Geometry-based fusion has shown promise for perception (e.g., object detection, motion forecasting). However, in the context of end-to-end driving, we find that imitation learning based on existing sensor fusion methods underperforms in complex driving scenarios with a high density of dynamic agents. Therefore, we propose TransFuser, a mechanism to integrate image and LiDAR representations using self-attention. Our approach uses transformer modules at multiple resolutions to fuse perspective view and bird's eye view feature maps. We experimentally validate its efficacy on a challenging new benchmark with long routes and dense traffic, as well as the official leaderboard of the CARLA urban driving simulator. At the time of submission, TransFuser outperforms all prior work on the CARLA leaderboard in terms of driving score by a large margin. Compared to geometry-based fusion, TransFuser reduces the average collisions per kilometer by 48%.

AB The role of a sign interpreting agent is to bridge the communication gap between the hearing-only and Deaf or Hard of Hearing communities by translating both from sign language to text and from text to sign language. Until now, much of the AI work in automated sign language processing has focused primarily on sign language to text translation, which puts the advantage mainly on the side of hearing individuals. In this article, we describe advances in sign language processing based on transformer networks. Specifically, we introduce SignNet II, a sign language processing architecture, a promising step towards facilitating two-way sign language communication. It is comprised of sign-to-text and text-to-sign networks jointly trained using a dual learning mechanism. Furthermore, by exploiting the notion of sign similarity, a metric embedding learning process is introduced to enhance the text-to-sign translation performance. Using a bank of multi-feature transformers, we analyzed several input feature representations and discovered that keypoint-based pose features consistently performed well, irrespective of the quality of the input videos. We demonstrated that the two jointly trained networks outperformed their singly-trained counterparts, showing noteworthy enhancements in BLEU-1 - BLEU-4 scores when tested on the largest available German Sign Language (GSL) benchmark dataset.

AB Leveraging the advances of natural language processing, most recent scene text recognizers adopt an encoder-decoder architecture where text images are first converted to representative features and then a sequence of characters via 'sequential decoding'. However, scene text images suffer from rich noises of different sources such as complex background and geometric distortions which often confuse the decoder and lead to incorrect alignment of visual features at noisy decoding time steps. This paper presents I2C2W, a novel scene text recognition technique that is tolerant to geometric and photometric degradation by decomposing scene text recognition into two inter-connected tasks. The first task focuses on image-to-character (I2C) mapping which detects a set of character candidates from images based on different alignments of visual features in an non-sequential way. The second task tackles character-to-word (C2W) mapping which recognizes scene text by decoding words from the detected character candidates. The direct learning from character semantics (instead of noisy image features) corrects falsely detected character candidates effectively which improves the final text recognition accuracy greatly. Extensive experiments over nine public datasets show that the proposed I2C2W outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins for challenging scene text datasets with various curvature and perspective distortions. It also achieves very competitive recognition performance over multiple normal scene text datasets.

AB Image harmonization, aiming to make composite images look more realistic, is an important and challenging task. The composite, synthesized by combining foreground from one image with background from another image, inevitably suffers from the issue of inharmonious appearance caused by distinct imaging conditions, i.e., lights. Current solutions mainly adopt an encoder-decoder architecture with convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the context of composite images, trying to understand what it should look like in the foreground referring to surrounding background. In this work, we seek to solve image harmonization with Transformer, by leveraging its powerful ability of modeling long-range context dependencies, for adjusting foreground light to make it compatible with background light while keeping structure and semantics unchanged. We present the design of our two vision Transformer frameworks and corresponding methods, as well as comprehensive experiments and empirical study, demonstrating the power of Transformer and investigating the Transformer for vision. Our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on the image harmonization as well as four additional vision and graphics tasks, i.e., image enhancement, image inpainting, white-balance editing, and portrait relighting, indicating the superiority of our work. Code, models, more results and details can be found at the project website http://ouc.ai/project/HarmonyTransformer.

AB Existing deep learning based de-raining approaches have resorted to the convolutional architectures. However, the intrinsic limitations of convolution, including local receptive fields and independence of input content, hinder the model's ability to capture long-range and complicated rainy artifacts. To overcome these limitations, we propose an effective and efficient transformer-based architecture for the image de-raining. First, we introduce general priors of vision tasks, i.e., locality and hierarchy, into the network architecture so that our model can achieve excellent de-raining performance without costly pre-training. Second, since the geometric appearance of rainy artifacts is complicated and of significant variance in space, it is essential for de-raining models to extract both local and non-local features. Therefore, we design the complementary window-based transformer and spatial transformer to enhance locality while capturing long-range dependencies. Besides, to compensate for the positional blindness of self-attention, we establish a separate representative space for modeling positional relationship, and design a new relative position enhanced multi-head self-attention. In this way, our model enjoys powerful abilities to capture dependencies from both content and position, so as to achieve better image content recovery while removing rainy artifacts. Experiments substantiate that our approach attains more appealing results than state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.

AB Dataset bias in vision-language tasks is becoming one of the main problems which hinders the progress of our community. Existing solutions lack a principled analysis about why modern image captioners easily collapse into dataset bias. In this paper, we present a novel perspective: Deconfounded Image Captioning (DIC), to find out the answer of this question, then retrospect modern neural image captioners, and finally propose a DIC framework: DICv1.0 to alleviate the negative effects brought by dataset bias. DIC is based on causal inference, whose two principles: the backdoor and front-door adjustments, help us review previous studies and design new effective models. In particular, we showcase that DICv1.0 can strengthen two prevailing captioning models and can achieve a single-model 131.1 CIDEr-D and 128.4 c40 CIDEr-D on Karpathy split and online split of the challenging MS COCO dataset, respectively. Interestingly, DICv1.0 is a natural derivation from our causal retrospect, which opens promising directions for image captioning.

AB The architecture of transformers, which recently witness booming applications in vision tasks, has pivoted against the widespread convolutional paradigm. Relying on the tokenization process that splits inputs into multiple tokens, transformers are capable of extracting their pairwise relationships using self-attention. While being the stemming building block of transformers, what makes for a good tokenizer has not been well understood in computer vision. In this work, we investigate this uncharted problem from an information trade-off perspective. In addition to unifying and understanding existing structural modifications, our derivation leads to better design strategies for vision tokenizers. The proposed Modulation across Tokens (MoTo) incorporates inter-token modeling capability through normalization. Furthermore, a regularization objective TokenProp is embraced in the standard training regime. Through extensive experiments on various transformer architectures, we observe both improved performance and intriguing properties of these two plug-and-play designs with negligible computational overhead. These observations further indicate the importance of the commonly-omitted designs of tokenizers in vision transformer.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been drawing significant attention to representation learning on graphs. Recent works developed frameworks to train very deep GNNs and showed impressive results in tasks like point cloud learning and protein interaction prediction. In this work, we study the performance of such deep models in large-scale graphs. In particular, we look at the effect of adequately choosing an aggregation function on deep models. We find that GNNs are very sensitive to the choice of aggregation functions (e.g. mean, max, and sum) when applied to different datasets. We systematically study and propose to alleviate this issue by introducing a novel class of aggregation functions named Generalized Aggregation Functions. The proposed functions extend beyond commonly used aggregation functions to a wide range of new permutation-invariant functions. Generalized Aggregation Functions are fully differentiable, where their parameters can be learned in an end-to-end fashion to yield a suitable aggregation function for each task. We show that equipped with the proposed aggregation functions, deep residual GNNs outperform state-of-the-art in several benchmarks from Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) across tasks and domains.

AB Manhattan and Atlanta worlds hold for the structured scenes with only vertical and horizontal dominant directions (DDs). To describe the scenes with additional sloping DDs, a mixture of independent Manhattan worlds seems plausible, but may lead to unaligned and unrelated DDs. By contrast, we propose a novel structural model called Hong Kong world. It is more general than Manhattan and Atlanta worlds since it can represent the environments with slopes, e.g., a city with hilly terrain, a house with sloping roof, and a loft apartment with staircase. Moreover, it is more compact and accurate than a mixture of independent Manhattan worlds by enforcing the orthogonality constraints between not only vertical and horizontal DDs, but also horizontal and sloping DDs. We further leverage the structural regularity of Hong Kong world for the line-based SLAM. Our SLAM method is reliable thanks to three technical novelties. First, we estimate DDs/vanishing points in Hong Kong world in a semi-searching way. We use a new consensus voting strategy for search, instead of traditional branch and bound. This method is the first one that can simultaneously determine the number of DDs, and achieve quasi-global optimality in terms of the number of inliers. Second, we compute the camera pose by exploiting the spatial relations between DDs in Hong Kong world. This method generates concise polynomials, and thus is more accurate and efficient than existing approaches designed for unstructured scenes. Third, we refine the estimated DDs in Hong Kong world by a novel filter-based method. Then we use these refined DDs to optimize the camera poses and 3D lines, leading to higher accuracy and robustness than existing optimization algorithms. In addition, we establish the first dataset of sequential images in Hong Kong world. Experiments showed that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and/or efficiency.

AB Adversarial training (AT) is considered to be one of the most reliable defenses against adversarial attacks. However, models trained with AT sacrifice standard accuracy and do not generalize well to unseen attacks. Recent works show generalization improvement with adversarial samples under unseen threat models such as on-manifold threat model or neural perceptual threat model. However, the former requires exact manifold information while the latter requires algorithm relaxation. Motivated by these considerations, we propose a novel threat model called Joint Space Threat Model (JSTM), which exploits the underlying manifold information with Normalizing Flow, ensuring that the exact manifold assumption holds. Under JSTM, we develop novel adversarial attacks and defenses. Specifically, we propose the Robust Mixup strategy in which we maximize the adversity of the interpolated images and gain robustness and prevent overfitting. Our experiments show that Interpolated Joint Space Adversarial Training (IJSAT) achieves good performance in standard accuracy, robustness, and generalization. IJSAT is also flexible and can be used as a data augmentation method to improve standard accuracy and combined with many existing AT approaches to improve robustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three benchmark datasets, CIFAR-10/100, OM-ImageNet and CIFAR-10-C.

AB While 3D visual saliency aims to predict regional importance of 3D surfaces in agreement with human visual perception and has been well researched in computer vision and graphics, latest work with eye-tracking experiments shows that state-of-the-art 3D visual saliency methods remain poor at predicting human fixations. Cues emerging prominently from these experiments suggest that 3D visual saliency might associate with 2D image saliency. This paper proposes a framework that combines a Generative Adversarial Network and a Conditional Random Field for learning visual saliency of both a single 3D object and a scene composed of multiple 3D objects with image saliency ground truth to 1) investigate whether 3D visual saliency is an independent perceptual measure or just a derivative of image saliency and 2) provide a weakly supervised method for more accurately predicting 3D visual saliency. Through extensive experiments, we not only demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, but also manage to answer the interesting and worthy question proposed within the title of this paper.

AB Our goal in this research is to study a more realistic environment in which we can conduct weakly-supervised multi-modal instance-level product retrieval for fine-grained product categories. We first contribute the Product1M datasets and define two real practical instance-level retrieval tasks that enable evaluations on price comparison and personalized recommendations. For both instance-level tasks, accurately identifying the intended product target mentioned in visual-linguistic data and mitigating the impact of irrelevant content are quite challenging. To address this, we devise a more effective cross-modal pretraining model capable of adaptively incorporating key concept information from multi-modal data. This is accomplished by utilizing an entity graph, where nodes represented entities and edges denoted the similarity relations between them. Specifically, a novel Entity-Graph Enhanced Cross-Modal Pretraining (EGE-CMP) model is proposed for instance-level commodity retrieval, which explicitly injects entity knowledge in both node-based and subgraph-based ways into the multi-modal networks via a self-supervised hybrid-stream transformer. This could reduce the confusion between different object contents, thereby effectively guiding the network to focus on entities with real semantics. Experimental results sufficiently verify the efficacy and generalizability of our EGE-CMP, outperforming several SOTA cross-modal baselines like CLIP Radford et al. 2021, UNITER Chen et al. 2020 and CAPTURE Zhan et al. 2021.

AB Billions of contact-based fingerprint images have been acquired in large databases. Contactless 2D fingerprint identification systems have emerged to provide more hygienic and secured alternatives and are highly sought under the current pandemic. The success of such an alternative requires high match accuracy, not just for the contactless-to-contactless but also for the contactless-to-contact-based matching, which is currently below expectations for large-scale deployments. We introduce a new approach to advance such expectations on match accuracy and also to address privacy-related concerns, e.g., recent GDPR regulations, in the acquisition of very large databases. This paper introduces a novel approach for accurately synthesizing multi-view contactless 3D fingerprints to develop a very large-scale multi-view fingerprint database, and corresponding contact-based fingerprint database. A unique advantage of our approach is the simultaneous availability of much-needed ground truth labels and alleviation of laborious and often prone to erroneous tasks performed by human labeling. We also introduce a new framework that can not only accurately match contactless to contact-based images but also contactless to contactless images, as both of these capabilities are simultaneously required to advance contactless fingerprint technologies. Our rigorous experimental results presented in this paper, both for within-database and cross-database experiments, illustrate outperforming results to simultaneously meet both of these expectations and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

ID VISION
AB As a task that aims to assess the trustworthiness of the model's prediction output during deployment, confidence estimation has received much research attention recently, due to its importance for the safe deployment of deep models. Previous works have outlined two important characteristics that a reliable confidence estimation model should possess, i.e., the ability to perform well under label imbalance and the ability to handle various out-of-distribution data inputs. In this work, we propose a meta-learning framework that can simultaneously improve upon both characteristics in a confidence estimation model. Specifically, we first construct virtual training and testing sets with some intentionally designed distribution differences between them. Our framework then uses the constructed sets to train the confidence estimation model through a virtual training and testing scheme leading it to learn knowledge that generalizes to diverse distributions. Besides, we also incorporate our framework with a modified meta optimization rule, which converges the confidence estimator to flat meta minima. We show the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on various tasks including monocular depth estimation, image classification, and semantic segmentation.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB The commonsense natural language inference (CNLI) tasks aim to select the most likely follow-up statement to a contextual description of ordinary, everyday events and facts. Current approaches to transfer learning of CNLI models across tasks require many labeled data from the new task. This paper presents a way to reduce this need for additional annotated training data from the new task by leveraging symbolic knowledge bases, such as ConceptNet. We formulate a teacher-student framework for mixed symbolic-neural reasoning, with the large-scale symbolic knowledge base serving as the teacher and a trained CNLI model as the student. This hybrid distillation process involves two steps. The first step is a symbolic reasoning process. Given a collection of unlabeled data, we use an abductive reasoning framework based on Grenander's pattern theory to create weakly labeled data. Pattern theory is an energy-based graphical probabilistic framework for reasoning among random variables with varying dependency structures. In the second step, the weakly labeled data, along with a fraction of the labeled data, is used to transfer-learn the CNLI model into the new task. The goal is to reduce the fraction of labeled data required. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by using three publicly available datasets (OpenBookQA, SWAG, and HellaSWAG) and evaluating three CNLI models (BERT, LSTM, and ESIM) that represent different tasks. We show that, on average, we achieve 63% of the top performance of a fully supervised BERT model with no labeled data. With only 1,000 labeled samples, we can improve this performance to 72%. Interestingly, without training, the teacher mechanism itself has significant inference power. The pattern theory framework achieves 32.7% accuracy on OpenBookQA, outperforming transformer-based models such as GPT (26.6%), GPT-2 (30.2%), and BERT (27.1%) by a significant margin. We demonstrate that the framework can be generalized to successfully train neural CNLI models using knowledge distillation under unsupervised and semi-supervised learning settings. Our results show that it outperforms all unsupervised and weakly supervised baselines and some early supervised approaches, while offering competitive performance with fully supervised baselines. Additionally, we show that the abductive learning framework can be adapted for other downstream tasks, such as unsupervised semantic textual similarity, unsupervised sentiment classification, and zero-shot text classification, without significant modification to the framework. Finally, user studies show that the generated interpretations enhance its explainability by providing key insights into its reasoning mechanism.

AB Partial multi-label learning (PML) is an emerging weakly supervised learning framework, where each training example is associated with multiple candidate labels which are only partially valid. To learn the multi-label predictive model from PML training examples, most existing approaches work by identifying valid labels within candidate label set via label confidence estimation. In this paper, a novel strategy towards partial multi-label learning is proposed by enabling binary decomposition for handling PML training examples. Specifically, the widely used error-correcting output codes (ECOC) techniques are adapted to transform the PML learning problem into a number of binary learning problems, which refrains from using the error-prone procedure of estimating labeling confidence of individual candidate label. In the encoding phase, a ternary encoding scheme is utilized to balance the definiteness and adequacy of the derived binary training set. In the decoding phase, a loss weighted scheme is applied to consider the empirical performance and predictive margin of derived binary classifiers. Extensive comparative studies against state-of-the-art PML learning approaches clearly show the performance advantage of the proposed binary decomposition strategy for partial multi-label learning.

AB Image view synthesis has seen great success in reconstructing photorealistic visuals, thanks to deep learning and various novel representations. The next key step in immersive virtual experiences is view synthesis of dynamic scenes. However, several challenges exist due to the lack of high-quality training datasets, and the additional time dimension for videos of dynamic scenes. To address this issue, we introduce a multi-view video dataset, captured with a custom 10-camera rig in 120FPS. The dataset contains 96 high-quality scenes showing various visual effects and human interactions in outdoor scenes. We develop a new algorithm, Deep 3D Mask Volume, which enables temporally-stable view extrapolation from binocular videos of dynamic scenes, captured by static cameras. Our algorithm addresses the temporal inconsistency of disocclusions by identifying the error-prone areas with a 3D mask volume, and replaces them with static background observed throughout the video. Our method enables manipulation in 3D space as opposed to simple 2D masks, We demonstrate better temporal stability than frame-by-frame static view synthesis methods, or those that use 2D masks. The resulting view synthesis videos show minimal flickering artifacts and allow for larger translational movements.

AB Learning predictive models for unlabeled spatiotemporal data is challenging in part because visual dynamics can be highly entangled, especially in real scenes. In this paper, we refer to the multi-modal output distribution of predictive learning as spatiotemporal modes. We find an experimental phenomenon named spatiotemporal mode collapse (STMC) on most existing video prediction models, that is, features collapse into invalid representation subspaces due to the ambiguous understanding of mixed physical processes. We propose to quantify STMC and explore its solution for the first time in the context of unsupervised predictive learning. To this end, we present ModeRNN, a decoupling-aggregation framework that has a strong inductive bias of discovering the compositional structures of spatiotemporal modes between recurrent states. We first leverage a set of dynamic slots with independent parameters to extract individual building components of spatiotemporal modes. We then perform a weighted fusion of slot features to adaptively aggregate them into a unified hidden representation for recurrent updates. Through a series of experiments, we show high correlation between STMC and the fuzzy prediction results of future video frames. Besides, ModeRNN is shown to better mitigate STMC and achieve the state of the art on five video prediction datasets.

ID ANTICIPATION
AB In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle the aforementioned challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to: 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Especially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) in multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting, prediction uncertainty is proportional to future stochasticity; 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents. The proposed framework can guide the development of more reliable and safer forecasting systems in the future.

AB Deep learning architectures, albeit successful in most computer vision tasks, were designed for data with an underlying Euclidean structure, which is not usually fulfilled since pre-processed data may lie on a non-linear space. In this article, we propose a geometric deep learning approach using rigid and non-rigid transformations, named KShapenet, for 2D and 3D landmark-based human motion analysis. Landmark configuration sequences are first modeled as trajectories on Kendall's shape space and then mapped to a linear tangent space. The resulting structured data are then input to a deep learning architecture, which includes a layer that optimizes over rigid and non-rigid transformations of landmark configurations, followed by a CNN-LSTM network. We apply KShapenet to 3D human landmark sequences for action and gait recognition, and 2D facial landmark sequences for expression recognition, and demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach with respect to state-of-the-art.

AB Multi-party learning provides an effective approach for training a machine learning model, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), over decentralized data by leveraging multiple decentralized computing devices, subjected to legal and practical constraints. Different parties, so-called local participants, usually provide heterogenous data in a decentralized mode, leading to non-IID data distributions across different local participants which pose a notorious challenge for multi-party learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel heterogeneous differentiable sampling (HDS) framework. Inspired by the dropout strategy in DNNs, a data-driven network sampling strategy is devised in the HDS framework, with differentiable sampling rates which allow each local participant to extract from a common global model the optimal local model that best adapts to its own data properties so that the size of the local model can be significantly reduced to enable more efficient inference. Meanwhile, co-adaptation of the global model via learning such local models allows for achieving better learning performance under non-IID data distributions and speeds up the convergence of the global model. Experiments have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over several popular multi-party learning techniques in the multi-party settings with non-IID data distributions.

AB Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in reinforcement learning upon the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of reinforcement learning in numerous domains such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen to tackle various challenges faced by reinforcement learning, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible reinforcement learning backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the reinforcement learning perspective and explore their potential challenges that await future research progress.

AB Medical diagnosis assistant (MDA) aims to build an interactive diagnostic agent to sequentially inquire about symptoms for discriminating diseases. However, since the dialogue records for building a patient simulator are collected passively, the collected records might be deteriorated by some task-unrelated biases, such as the preference of the collectors. These biases might hinder the diagnostic agent to capture transportable knowledge from the simulator. This work identifies and resolves two representative non-causal biases, i.e., (i) default-answer bias and (ii) distributional inquiry bias. Specifically, Bias (i) originates from the patient simulator which tries to answer the unrecorded inquiries with some biased default answers. To eliminate this bias and improve upon a well-known causal inference technique, i.e., propensity score matching, we propose a novel propensity latent matching in building a patient simulator to effectively answer unrecorded inquiries; Bias (ii) inherently comes along with the passively collected data that the agent might learn by remembering what to inquire within the training data while not able to generalize to the out-of-distribution cases. To this end, we propose a progressive assurance agent, which includes the dual processes accounting for symptom inquiry and disease diagnosis respectively. The diagnosis process pictures the patient mentally and probabilistically by intervention to eliminate the effect of the inquiry behavior. And the inquiry process is driven by the diagnosis process to inquire about symptoms to enhance the diagnostic confidence which alters as the patient distribution changes. In this cooperative manner, our proposed agent can improve upon the out-of-distribution generalization significantly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance and possesses the advantage of transportability.

AB Spatial-Temporal Video Super-Resolution (ST-VSR) aims to generate high-quality videos with higher resolution (HR) and higher frame rate (HFR). Quite intuitively, pioneering two-stage based methods complete ST-VSR by directly combining two sub-tasks: Spatial Video Super-Resolution (S-VSR) and Temporal Video Super-Resolution (T-VSR) but ignore the reciprocal relations among them. 1) T-VSR to S-VSR: temporal correlations help accurate spatial detail representation; 2) S-VSR to T-VSR: abundant spatial information contributes to the refinement of temporal prediction. To this end, we propose a one-stage based Cycle-projected Mutual learning network (CycMuNet) for ST-VSR, which makes full use of spatial-temporal correlations via the mutual learning between S-VSR and T-VSR. Specifically, we propose to exploit the mutual information among them via iterative up- and down projections, where spatial and temporal features are fully fused and distilled, helping high-quality video reconstruction. In addition, we also show interesting extensions for efficient network design (CycMuNet+), such as parameter sharing and dense connection on projection units and feedback mechanism in CycMuNet. Besides extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we also compare our proposed CycMuNet (+) with S-VSR and T-VSR tasks, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Syntactic parsing is a highly linguistic processing task whose parser requires training on treebanks from the expensive human annotation. As it is unlikely to obtain a treebank for every human language, in this work, we propose an effective cross-lingual UD parsing framework for transferring parser from only one source monolingual treebank to any other target languages without treebank available. To reach satisfactory parsing accuracy among quite different languages, we introduce two language modeling tasks into the training process of dependency parsing as multi-tasking. Assuming only unlabeled data from target languages plus the source treebank can be exploited together, we adopt a self-training strategy for further performance improvement in terms of our multi-task framework. Our proposed cross-lingual parsers are implemented for English, Chinese, and 29 UD treebanks. The empirical study shows that our cross-lingual parsers yield promising results for all target languages, approaching the parser performance which is trained in its own target treebank.

AB Defining the loss function is an important part of neural network design and critically determines the success of deep learning modeling. A significant shortcoming of the conventional loss functions is that they weight all regions in the input image volume equally, despite the fact that the system is known to be heterogeneous (i.e., some regions can achieve high prediction performance more easily than others). Here, we introduce a region-specific loss to lift the implicit assumption of homogeneous weighting for better learning. We divide the entire volume into multiple sub-regions, each with an individualized loss constructed for optimal local performance. Effectively, this scheme imposes higher weightings on the sub-regions that are more difficult to segment, and vice versa. Furthermore, the regional false positive and false negative errors are computed for each input image during a training step and the regional penalty is adjusted accordingly to enhance the overall accuracy of the prediction. Using different public and in-house medical image datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed regionally adaptive loss paradigm outperforms conventional methods in the multi-organ segmentations, without any modification to the neural network architecture or additional data preparation.

AB Deep learning on large-scale data is currently dominant nowadays. The unprecedented scale of data has been arguably one of the most important driving forces behind its success. However, there still exist scenarios where collecting data or labels could be extremely expensive, e.g., medical imaging and robotics. To fill up this gap, this paper considers the problem of data-efficient learning from scratch using a small amount of representative data. First, we characterize this problem by active learning on homeomorphic tubes of spherical manifolds. This naturally generates feasible hypothesis class. With homologous topological properties, we identify an important connection - finding tube manifolds is equivalent to minimizing hyperspherical energy (MHE) in physical geometry. Inspired by this connection, we propose a MHE-based active learning (MHEAL) algorithm, and provide comprehensive theoretical guarantees for MHEAL, covering convergence and generalization analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of MHEAL in a wide range of applications for data-efficient learning, including deep clustering, distribution matching, version space sampling, and deep active learning.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB The main aspect powering GNNs is the multi-layer network architecture to learn the nonlinear representation for graph learning task. The core operation in GNNs is the message propagation in which each node updates its information by aggregating the information from its neighbors. Existing GNNs usually adopt either linear neighborhood aggregation (e.g. mean, sum) or max aggregator in their message propagation. 1) For linear aggregators, the whole nonlinearity and network's capacity of GNNs are generally limited because deeper GNNs usually suffer from the over-smoothing issue due to their inherent information propagation mechanism. Also, linear aggregators are usually vulnerable to the spatial perturbations. 2) For max aggregator, it usually fails to be aware of the detailed information of node representations within neighborhood. To overcome these issues, we re-think the message propagation mechanism in GNNs and develop the new general nonlinear aggregators for neighborhood information aggregation in GNNs. One main aspect of our nonlinear aggregators is that they all provide the optimally balanced aggregator between max and mean/sum aggregators. Thus, they can inherit both i) high nonlinearity that enhances network's capacity, robustness and ii) detail-sensitivity that is aware of the detailed information of node representations in GNNs' message propagation. Promising experiments show the effectiveness, high capacity and robustness of the proposed methods.

AB Recently neural architecture (NAS) search has attracted great interest in academia and industry. It remains a challenging problem due to the huge search space and computational costs. Recent studies in NAS mainly focused on the usage of weight sharing to train a SuperNet once. However, the corresponding branch of each subnetwork is not guaranteed to be fully trained. It may not only incur huge computation costs but also affect the architecture ranking in the retraining procedure. We propose a multi-teacher-guided NAS, which proposes to use the adaptive ensemble and perturbation-aware knowledge distillation algorithm in the one-shot-based NAS algorithm. The optimization method aiming to find the optimal descent directions is used to obtain adaptive coefficients for the feature maps of the combined teacher model. Besides, we propose a specific knowledge distillation process for optimal architectures and perturbed ones in each searching process to learn better feature maps for later distillation procedures. Comprehensive experiments verify our approach is flexible and effective. We show improvement in precision and search efficiency in the standard recognition dataset. We also show improvement in correlation between the accuracy of the search algorithm and true accuracy by NAS benchmark datasets.

AB Traditional approaches for learning on categorical data underexploit the dependencies between columns (a.k.a. fields) in a dataset because they rely on the embedding of data points driven alone by the classification/regression loss. In contrast, we propose a novel method for learning on categorical data with the goal of exploiting dependencies between fields. Instead of modelling statistics of features globally (i.e., by the covariance matrix of features), we learn a global field dependency matrix that captures dependencies between fields and then we refine the global field dependency matrix at the instance-wise level with different weights (so-called local dependency modelling) w.r.t. each field to improve the modelling of the field dependencies. Our algorithm exploits the meta-learning paradigm, i.e., the dependency matrices are refined in the inner loop of the meta-learning algorithm without the use of labels, whereas the outer loop intertwines the updates of the embedding matrix (the matrix performing projection) and global dependency matrix in a supervised fashion (with the use of labels). Our method is simple yet it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on six popular dataset benchmarks. Detailed ablation studies provide additional insights into our method.

AB Conditional Normalizing Flows (CNFs) are flexible generative models capable of representing complicated distributions with high dimensionality and large interdimensional correlations, making them appealing for structured output learning. Their effectiveness in modelling multivariates spatio-temporal structured data has yet to be completely investigated. We propose MotionFlow as a novel normalizing flows approach that autoregressively conditions the output distributions on the spatio-temporal input features. It combines deterministic and stochastic representations with CNFs to create a probabilistic neural generative approach that can model the variability seen in high-dimensional structured spatio-temporal data. We specifically propose to use conditional priors to factorize the latent space for the time dependent modeling. We also exploit the use of masked convolutions as autoregressive conditionals in CNFs. As a result, our method is able to define arbitrarily expressive output probability distributions under temporal dynamics in multivariate prediction tasks. We apply our method to different tasks, including trajectory prediction, motion prediction, time series forecasting, and binary segmentation, and demonstrate that our model is able to leverage normalizing flows to learn complicated time dependent conditional distributions.

AB Deep models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of visual recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the generalization ability of deep models is seriously affected by noisy labels. Though deep learning packages have different losses, this is not transparent for users to choose consistent losses. This paper addresses the problem of how to use abundant loss functions designed for the traditional classification problem in the presence of label noise. We present a dynamic label learning (DLL) algorithm for noisy label learning and then prove that any surrogate loss function can be used for classification with noisy labels by using our proposed algorithm, with a consistency guarantee that the label noise does not ultimately hinder the search for the optimal classifier of the noise-free sample. In addition, we provide a depth theoretical analysis of our algorithm to verify the justifies' correctness and explain the powerful robustness. Finally, experimental results on synthetic and real datasets confirm the efficiency of our algorithm and the correctness of our justifies and show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms or is comparable to current state-of-the-art counterparts.

AB In this paper, we introduce a challenging yet practical setting for person re-identification (ReID) task, named lifelong person re-identification (LReID), which aims to continuously train a ReID model across multiple domains and the trained model is required to generalize well on both seen and unseen domains. It is therefore critical to learn a ReID model that can learn a generalized representation without forgetting knowledge of seen domains. In this paper, we propose a new MEmorizing and GEneralizing framework (MEGE) for LReID, which can jointly prevent the model from forgetting and improve its generalization ability. Specifically, our MEGE is composed of two novel modules, i.e., Adaptive Knowledge Accumulation (AKA) and differentiable Ranking Consistency Distillation (RCD). Taking inspiration from the cognitive processes in the human brain, we endow AKA with two special capacities, knowledge representation and knowledge operation by graph convolution networks. AKA can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting on seen domains while improving the generalization ability to unseen domains. By considering the ranking factor that is specifically important in ReID, RCD is designed to distill the ranking knowledge in a differentiable manner, which can further prevent the catastrophic forgetting. To supporting the study of LReID, we build a new and large-scale benchmark with two practical evaluation protocols that consider the metrics of non-forgetting and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that 1) our MEGE framework can effectively improve the performance on seen and unseen domains under the domain-incremental learning constraint, and that 2) the proposed MEGE outperforms state-of-the-art competitors by large margins.

AB Time series analysis is essential to many far-reaching applications of data science and statistics including economic and financial forecasting, surveillance, and automated business processing. Though being greatly successful of Transformer in computer vision and natural language processing, the potential of employing it as the general backbone in analyzing the ubiquitous times series data has not been fully released yet. Prior Transformer variants on time series highly rely on task-dependent designs and pre-assumed "pattern biases", revealing its insufficiency in representing nuanced seasonal, cyclic, and outlier patterns which are highly prevalent in time series. As a consequence, they can not generalize well to different time series analysis tasks. To tackle the challenges, we propose DifFormer, an effective and efficient Transformer architecture that can serve as a workhorse for a variety of time-series analysis tasks. DifFormer incorporates a novel multi-resolutional differencing mechanism, which is able to progressively and adaptively make nuanced yet meaningful changes prominent, meanwhile, the periodic or cyclic patterns can be dynamically captured with flexible lagging and dynamic ranging operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate DifFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on three essential time-series analysis tasks, including classification, regression, and forecasting. In addition to its superior performances, DifFormer also excels in efficiency - a linear time/memory complexity with empirically lower time consumption.

AB Recent works have revealed an essential paradigm in designing loss functions that differentiate individual losses versus aggregate losses. The individual loss measures the quality of the model on a sample, while the aggregate loss combines individual losses/scores over each training sample. Both have a common procedure that aggregates a set of individual values to a single numerical value. The ranking order reflects the most fundamental relation among individual values in designing losses. In addition, decomposability, in which a loss can be decomposed into an ensemble of individual terms, becomes a significant property of organizing losses/scores. This survey provides a systematic and comprehensive review of rank-based decomposable losses in machine learning. Specifically, we provide a new taxonomy of loss functions that follows the perspectives of aggregate loss and individual loss. We identify the aggregator to form such losses, which are examples of set functions. We organize the rank-based decomposable losses into eight categories. Following these categories, we review the literature on rank-based aggregate losses and rank-based individual losses. We describe general formulas for these losses and connect them with existing research topics. We also suggest future research directions spanning unexplored, remaining, and emerging issues in rank-based decomposable losses.

AB In this paper, we propose Point-Voxel Correlation Fields to explore relations between two consecutive point clouds and estimate scene flow that represents 3D motions. Most existing works only consider local correlations, which are able to handle small movements but fail when there are large displacements. Therefore, it is essential to introduce all-pair correlation volumes that are free from local neighbor restrictions and cover both short- and long-term dependencies. However, it is challenging to efficiently extract correlation features from all-pairs fields in the 3D space, given the irregular and unordered nature of point clouds. To tackle this problem, we present point-voxel correlation fields, proposing distinct point and voxel branches to inquire about local and long-range correlations from all-pair fields respectively. To exploit point-based correlations, we adopt the K-Nearest Neighbors search that preserves fine-grained information in the local region, which guarantees the scene flow estimation precision. By voxelizing point clouds in a multi-scale manner, we construct pyramid correlation voxels to model long-range correspondences, which are utilized to handle fast-moving objects. Integrating these two types of correlations, we propose Point-Voxel Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (PV-RAFT) architecture that employs an iterative scheme to estimate scene flow from point clouds. To adapt to different flow scope conditions and obtain more fine-grained results, we further propose Deformable PV-RAFT (DPV-RAFT), where the Spatial Deformation deforms the voxelized neighborhood, and the Temporal Deformation controls the iterative update process. We evaluate the proposed method on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets and experimental results show that we outperform state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins.

AB In this work, we explore neat yet effective Transformer-based frameworks for visual grounding. The previous methods generally address the core problem of visual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with manually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated but also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this, we first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by Transformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box coordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be replaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher performance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone against uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited visual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make two-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely Transformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature encoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that removes external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for vision-language fusion at the intermediate layers. We conduct extensive experiments on five prevalent datasets, and report a series of state-of-the-art records.

AB Many attack paradigms against deep neural networks have been well studied, such as the backdoor attack in the training stage and the adversarial attack in the inference stage. In this article, we study a novel attack paradigm, the bit-flip based weight attack, which directly modifies weight bits of the attacked model in the deployment stage. To meet various attack scenarios, we propose a general formulation including terms to achieve effectiveness and stealthiness goals and a constraint on the number of bit-flips. Furthermore, benefitting from this extensible and flexible formulation, we present two cases with different malicious purposes, i.e., single sample attack (SSA) and triggered samples attack (TSA). SSA which aims at misclassifying a specific sample into a target class is a binary optimization with determining the state of the binary bits (0 or 1); TSA which is to misclassify the samples embedded with a specific trigger is a mixed integer programming (MIP) with flipped bits and a learnable trigger. Utilizing the latest technique in integer programming, we equivalently reformulate them as continuous optimization problems, whose approximate solutions can be effectively and efficiently obtained by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

AB In this paper, we develop upon the emerging topic of loss function learning, which aims to learn loss functions that significantly improve the performance of the models trained under them. Specifically, we propose a new meta-learning framework for learning model-agnostic loss functions via a hybrid neuro-symbolic search approach. The framework first uses evolution-based methods to search the space of primitive mathematical operations to find a set of symbolic loss functions. Second, the set of learned loss functions are subsequently parameterized and optimized via an end-to-end gradient-based training procedure. The versatility of the proposed framework is empirically validated on a diverse set of supervised learning tasks. Results show that the meta-learned loss functions discovered by the newly proposed method outperform both the cross-entropy loss and state-of-the-art loss function learning methods on a diverse range of neural network architectures and datasets. We make our code available at *retracted*.

AB Geospatial object segmentation, a fundamental Earth vision task, always suffers from scale variation, the larger intra-class variance of background, and foreground-background imbalance in high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. Generic semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on the scale variation in natural scenarios. However, the other two problems are insufficiently considered in large area Earth observation scenarios. In this paper, we propose a foreground-aware relation network (FarSeg++) from the perspectives of relation-based, optimization-based, and objectness-based foreground modeling, alleviating the above two problems. From the perspective of the relations, the foreground-scene relation module improves the discrimination of the foreground features via the foreground-correlated contexts associated with the object-scene relation. From the perspective of optimization, foreground-aware optimization is proposed to focus on foreground examples and hard examples of the background during training to achieve a balanced optimization. Besides, from the perspective of objectness, a foreground-aware decoder is proposed to improve the objectness representation, alleviating the objectness prediction problem that is the main bottleneck revealed by an empirical upper bound analysis. We also introduce a new large-scale high-resolution urban vehicle segmentation dataset to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and push the development of objectness prediction further forward. The experimental results suggest that FarSeg++ is superior to the state-of-the-art generic semantic segmentation methods and can achieve a better trade-off between speed and accuracy.

AB Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an important technology for the monitoring, management, and control of communication systems. In recent years, machine learning approaches are becoming popular to improve the effectiveness of AMC for radio signals. However, the automatic modulation open-set recognition (AMOSR) scheme that aims to identify the known modulation types and recognize the unknown modulation signals is not well studied. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal marginal prototype framework for radio frequency (RF) signals (MMPRF) to improve AMOSR performance. First, MMPRF addresses the problem of simultaneous recognition of closed and open sets by partitioning the feature space in the way of one versus other and marginal restrictions. Second, we exploit the wireless signal domain knowledge to extract a series of signal-related features to enhance the AMOSR capability. In addition, we propose a GAN-based unknown sample generation strategy to allow the model to understand the unknown world. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several publicly available radio modulation data, and experimental results show that our proposed MMPRF outperforms the state-of-the-art AMOSR methods.

AB With the rapid development of high-resolution 3D vision applications, the traditional way of manipulating surface detail requires considerable memory and computing time. To address these problems, we introduce an efficient surface detail processing framework in 2D normal domain, which extracts new normal feature representations as the carrier of micro geometry structures that are illustrated both theoretically and empirically in this article. Compared with the existing state of the arts, we verify and demonstrate that the proposed normal-based representation has three important properties, including detail separability, detail transferability and detail idempotence. Finally, three new schemes are further designed for geometric surface detail processing applications, including geometric texture synthesis, geometry detail transfer, and 3D surface super-resolution. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on the latest benchmark dataset verify the effectiveness and versatility of our normal-based representation, which accepts 30 times of the input surface vertices but at the same time only takes 6.5% memory cost and 14.0% running time in comparison with existing competing algorithms.

AB Millions of papers are submitted and published every year, but researchers often do not have much information about the journals that interest them. In this paper, we introduced the first dynamical clustering algorithm for symbolic polygonal data and this was applied to build scientific journals profiles. Dynamic clustering algorithms are a family of iterative two-step relocation algorithms involving the construction of clusters at each iteration and the identification of a suitable representation or prototype (means, axes, probability laws, groups of elements, etc.) for each cluster by locally optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fitting between clusters and their corresponding prototypes The application gives a powerful vision to understand the main variables that describe journals. Symbolic polygonal data can represent summarized extensive datasets taking into account variability. In addition, we developed cluster and partition interpretation indices for polygonal data that have the ability to extract insights about clustering results. From these indices, we discovered, e.g., that the number of difficult words in abstract is fundamental to building journal profiles.

AB The high prevalence of mental disorders gradually poses a huge pressure on the public healthcare services. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has emerged to relieve the tension in healthcare institutions by detecting abnormal neuroimaging-derived phenotypes. However, training deep learning models relies on sufficient annotated datasets, which can be costly and laborious. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) and transfer learning (TL) can mitigate this challenge by leveraging unlabeled data within the same institution and advantageous information from source domain, respectively. This work is the first attempt to propose an effective semi-supervised transfer learning (SSTL) framework dubbed S3TL for CAD of mental disorders on fMRI data. Within S3TL, a secure cross-domain feature alignment method is developed to generate target-related source model in SSL. Subsequently, we propose an enhanced dual-stage pseudo-labeling approach to assign pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples in target domain. Finally, an advantageous knowledge transfer method is conducted to improve the generalization capability of the target model. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that S3TL achieves competitive accuracies of 69.14%, 69.65%, and 72.62% on ABIDE-I, ABIDE-II, and ADHD-200 datasets, respectively. Furthermore, the simulation experiments also demonstrate the application potential of S3TL through model interpretation analysis and federated learning extension.

AB Text-to-SQL is the task of converting a natural language utterance plus the corresponding database schema into a SQL program. The inputs naturally form a heterogeneous graph while the output SQL can be transduced into an abstract syntax tree (AST). Traditional encoder-decoder models ignore higher-order semantics in heterogeneous graph encoding and introduce permutation biases during AST construction, thus incapable of exploiting the refined structure knowledge precisely. In this work, we propose a generic heterogeneous graph to abstract syntax tree (HG2AST) framework to integrate dedicated structure knowledge into statistics-based models. On the encoder side, we leverage a line graph enhanced encoder (LGESQL) to iteratively update both node and edge features through dual graph message passing and aggregation. On the decoder side, a grammar-based decoder first constructs the equivalent SQL AST and then transforms it into the desired SQL via post-processing. To avoid over-fitting permutation biases, we propose a golden tree-oriented learning (GTL) algorithm to adaptively control the expanding order of AST nodes. The graph encoder and tree decoder are combined into a unified framework through two auxiliary modules. Extensive experiments on various text-to-SQL datasets, including single/multi-table, single/cross-domain, and multilingual settings, demonstrate the superiority and broad applicability.

AB Digital images are vulnerable to nefarious tampering attacks such as content addition or removal that severely alter the original meaning. It is somehow like a person without protection that is open to various kinds of viruses. Image immunization (Imuge) is a technology of protecting the images by introducing trivial perturbation, so that the protected images are immune to the viruses in that the tampered contents can be auto-recovered. This paper presents Imuge+, an enhanced scheme for image immunization. By observing the invertible relationship between image immunization and the corresponding self-recovery, we employ an invertible neural network to jointly learn image immunization and recovery respectively in the forward and backward pass. We also introduce an efficient attack layer that involves both malicious tamper and benign image post-processing, where a novel distillation-based JPEG simulator is proposed for improved JPEG robustness. Our method achieves promising results in real-world tests where experiments show accurate tamper localization as well as high-fidelity content recovery. Additionally, we show superior performance on tamper localization compared to state-of-the-art schemes based on passive forensics.

AB Real-time density estimation is ubiquitous in many applications, including computer vision and signal processing. Kernel density estimation is arguably one of the most commonly used density estimation techniques, and the use of "sliding window" mechanism adapts kernel density estimators to dynamic processes. In this article, we derive the asymptotic mean integrated squared error (AMISE) upper bound for the "sliding window" kernel density estimator. This upper bound provides a principled guide to devise a novel estimator, which we name the temporal adaptive kernel density estimator (TAKDE). Compared to heuristic approaches for "sliding window" kernel density estimator, TAKDE is theoretically optimal in terms of the worst-case AMISE. We provide numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that TAKDE outperforms other state-of-the-art dynamic density estimators (including those outside of kernel family). In particular, TAKDE achieves a superior test log-likelihood with a smaller run-time.

AB Long-tail distribution is widely spread in real-world applications. Due to the extremely small ratio of instances, tail categories often show inferior accuracy. In this paper, we find such performance bottleneck is mainly caused by the imbalanced gradients, which can be categorized into two parts: (1) positive part, deriving from the samples of the same category, and (2) negative part, contributed by other categories. Based on comprehensive experiments, it is also observed that the gradient ratio of accumulated positives to negatives is a good indicator to measure how balanced a category is trained. Inspired by this, we come up with a gradient-driven training mechanism to tackle the long-tail problem: re-balancing the positive/negative gradients dynamically according to current accumulative gradients, with a unified goal of achieving balance gradient ratios. Taking advantage of the simple and flexible gradient mechanism, we introduce a new family of gradient-driven loss functions, namely equalization losses. We conduct extensive experiments on a wide spectrum of visual tasks, including two-stage/single-stage long-tailed object detection (LVIS), long-tailed image classification (ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, iNaturalist), and long-tailed semantic segmentation (ADE20 K). Our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed equalization losses.

AB The resolution of intelligence tests, in particular numerical sequences, has been of great interest in the evaluation of AI systems. We present a new computational model called KitBit that uses a reduced set of algorithms and their combinations to build a predictive model that finds the underlying pattern in numerical sequences, such as those included in IQ tests and others of much greater complexity. We present the fundamentals of the model and its application in different cases. First, the system is tested on a set of number series used in IQ tests collected from various sources. Next, our model is successfully applied on the series used to evaluate the models reported in the literature. In both cases, the system is capable of solving these types of problems in less than a second using standard computing power. Finally, KitBit's algorithms have been applied for the first time to the complete set of entire series of the well-known OEIS database. We find a pattern in the form of a list of algorithms and predict the following terms in the largest number of series to date. These results demonstrate the potential of KitBit to solve complex problems that could be represented numerically.

AB Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods. Moreover, qualitative results demonstrate that not only the obtained hash codes can strongly correspond to certain kinds of crucial properties of fine-grained objects, but also our self-consistency designs can effectively overcome simplicity bias in fine-grained hashing.

AB The performance of current Scene Graph Generation (SGG) models is severely hampered by hard-to-distinguish predicates, e.g., "woman-on/standing on/walking on-beach". As general SGG models tend to predict head predicates and re-balancing strategies prefer tail categories, none of them can appropriately handle hard-to-distinguish predicates. To tackle this issue, inspired by fine-grained image classification, which focuses on differentiating hard-to-distinguish objects, we propose an Adaptive Fine-Grained Predicates Learning (FGPL-A) which aims at differentiating hard-to-distinguish predicates for SGG. First, we introduce an Adaptive Predicate Lattice (PL-A) to figure out hard-to-distinguish predicates, which adaptively explores predicate correlations in keeping with model's dynamic learning pace. Practically, PL-A is initialized from SGG dataset, and gets refined by exploring model's predictions of current mini-batch. Utilizing PL-A, we propose an Adaptive Category Discriminating Loss (CDL-A) and an Adaptive Entity Discriminating Loss (EDL-A), which progressively regularize model's discriminating process with fine-grained supervision concerning model's dynamic learning status, ensuring balanced and efficient learning process. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model-agnostic strategy significantly boosts performance of benchmark models on VG-SGG and GQA-SGG datasets by up to 175% and 76% on Mean Recall@100, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, experiments on Sentence-to-Graph Retrieval and Image Captioning tasks further demonstrate practicability of our method.

AB We present a unified formulation and model for three motion and 3D perception tasks: optical flow, rectified stereo matching and unrectified stereo depth estimation from posed images. Unlike previous specialized architectures for each specific task, we formulate all three tasks as a unified dense correspondence matching problem, which can be solved with a single model by directly comparing feature similarities. Such a formulation calls for discriminative feature representations, which we achieve using a Transformer, in particular the cross-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that cross-attention enables integration of knowledge from another image via cross-view interactions, which greatly improves the quality of the extracted features. Our unified model naturally enables cross-task transfer since the model architecture and parameters are shared across tasks. We outperform RAFT with our unified model on the challenging Sintel dataset, and our final model that uses a few additional task-specific refinement steps outperforms or compares favorably to recent state-of-the-art methods on 10 popular flow, stereo and depth datasets, while being simpler and more efficient in terms of model design and inference speed.

   geometric information; annotation-free instance segmentation
AB We address the problem of annotation-free instance segmentation in the wild, aiming to relieve the expensive cost of manual mask annotations. Existing approaches utilize appearance cues, such as color, edge, and texture information, to generate pseudo masks for instance segmentation. However, due to the ambiguity of defining an object by visual appearance alone, these methods fail to distinguish objects from the background under complex scenes. Beyond visual cues, objects are one-piece in space and move together over time, which indicates that geometry cues, such as spatial continuity and motion consistency, are also exploitable for this problem. To directly utilize geometry cues, we propose an affinity-based paradigm for annotation-free instance segmentation. The new paradigm is called object affinity learning, a proxy task of annotation-free instance segmentation, which aims to tell whether two pixels come from the same object by learning feature representation from geometry cues. During inference, the learned object affinity could be further converted into instance segmentation masks by some graph partition algorithms. The proposed object affinity learning achieves much better instance segmentation performance than existing pseudo-mask-based methods on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI dataset.

AB Despite its popularity as a one-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach, the applicability of differentiable architecture search (DARTS) on complex vision tasks is still limited by the high computation and memory costs incurred by the over-parameterized supernet. We propose a new architecture search method called EasyNAS, whose memory and computational efficiency is achieved via our devised operator merging technique which shares and merges the weights of candidate convolution operations into a single convolution, and a dynamic channel refinement strategy. We also introduce a configurable search space-to-supernet conversion tool, leveraging the concept of atomic search components, to enable its application from classification to more complex vision tasks: detection and semantic segmentation. In classification, EasyNAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NAS-Bench-201 benchmark, attaining an impressive 76.2% accuracy on ImageNet. For detection, it achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 40.1 with 120 frames per second (FPS) on MS-COCO test-dev. Additionally, we transfer the discovered architecture to the rotation detection task, where EasyNAS achieves a remarkable 77.05 mAP$_{50}$50 on the DOTA-v1.0 test set, using only 21.1 M parameters. In semantic segmentation, it achieves a competitive mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 72.6% at 173 FPS on Cityscape, after searching for only 0.7 GPU-day.

DT Article
DE Lighting; Estimation; Shape; Reflection; Optimization; Reflectivity;

AB This article presents a new approach for surface normal recovery from polarization images under an unknown distant light. Polarization provides rich cues of object geometry and material, but it is also influenced by different lighting conditions. Different from previous Shape-from-Polarization (SfP) methods, which rely on handcrafted or data-driven priors, we analytically investigate the benefits of estimating distant lighting for resolving the ambiguity in normal estimation from SfP using the polarimetric Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (pBRDF) based image formation model. We then propose a two-stage learning framework that first effectively exploits polarization and shading cues to estimate the reflectance and lighting information and then optimizes the initial normal as the geometric prior. Leveraging the normal prior with the polarization cues from the input images, our network further generates the surface normal with more details in the second stage. We also present a data generation pipeline derived from the pBRDF model enabling model training and create a real dataset for evaluation of SfP approaches. Extensive ablation studies show the effectiveness of our designed architecture, and our approach outperforms existing methods in quantitative and qualitative experiments on real data.

AB Face clustering is a promising method for annotating unlabeled face images. Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly, however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are inefficient for inference due to the use of numerous overlapped subgraphs. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Specifically, we design a structure-preserving subgraph sampling strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase the training data scale from 10(5) to 10(7). On this basis, a novel hierarchical GCN training paradigm is further proposed for better capturing the dynamic local structure. During inference, the STAR-FC performs efficient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the second step to mine the local structural information, where a calibration module is further proposed for fairer edge scores. The STAR-FC gets 93.21 pairwise F-score on standard partial MS1M within 312 seconds, which far surpasses the state-of-the-arts while maintaining high inference efficiency. Furthermore, we are the first to train on an ultra-large-scale graph with 20 M nodes, and achieve superior inference results on 12 M testing data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering.

AB Circular data clustering has recently been solved exactly in sub-quadratic time. However, the solution requires a given number of clusters; methods for choosing this number on linear data are inapplicable to circular data. To fill this gap, we introduce the circular silhouette to measure cluster quality and a fast algorithm to calculate the average silhouette width. The algorithm runs in linear time to the number of points on sorted data, instead of quadratic time by the silhouette definition. Empirically, it is over 3000 times faster than by silhouette definition on 1,000,000 circular data points in five clusters. On simulated datasets, the algorithm returned correct numbers of clusters. We identified clusters on round genomes of human mitochondria and bacteria. On sunspot activity data, we found changed solar-cycle patterns over the past two centuries. Using the circular silhouette not only eliminates the subjective selection of number of clusters, but is also scalable to big circular and periodic data abundant in science, engineering, and medicine.

ID PREDICTION
AB Session-aware recommender systems capture user-specific preferences that emerge within multiple user sessions by leveraging the sequential nature of user interactions. Existing session-aware recommendation methods face challenges in finding the right balance between exploration and exploitation leading to less diverse recommendations and also suffering from overestimation bias. This bias problem refers to the tendency for value estimates to be higher than their true values resulting in slower convergence, suboptimal, and less diverse recommendations. This paper proposes a Double Deep Q-network based session-aware recommender system, DDQN-SaRS, which takes care of the overestimation bias and generates diverse recommendations capturing the user's dynamic interests. The proposed system works in two phases. The first phase generates embedding for users, items, and sessions using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The obtained embedding vectors are then given to Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), a Double Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) technique for suggesting items of interest to the user(s) in the second phase. DDQN decouples the task of action selection and action evaluation by utilizing two networks viz. main and target networks and resolves the overestimation bias problem while maintaining diversity in recommendations. The proposed system learns recommendation policies and corresponding rewards from a pure offline setting. It is validated on two real-world datasets: Diginetica from the CIKM Cup Challenge 2016 and Retailrocket from the Kaggle competition. Experimental results show that our proposed system, DDQN-SaRS outperformed various baseline algorithms viz. S-POP, Item-KNN, GRU4Rec, STAMP, HRNN, NSAR,IDSR, and GNN-GNF.

AB Besides the need for more advanced predictive methods, there is increasing demand for easily interpretable results. Couples of enhanced association rules (a generalization of association rules/apriori/frequent itemsets) are excellent candidates for this task. They can be interpreted in various ways, subgroup discovery being an example. A typical result in rule mining is that there are too low or too many rules in the resulting ruleset. Analysts must usually iterate 5-15 times to get a reasonable number of rules. Inspired by research in a similar area of frequent itemsets to simplify input and parameter-free frequent itemsets, we have proposed a novel algorithm that finds rules based not on parameters like support and confidence but the best rules by a given range of required rule count in output. We propose this algorithm for couples of rules - SD4ft-Miner procedure and benefits from a brand new implementation of methods of mechanizing hypothesis formation in Python called Cleverminer that allows easy implementation of this algorithm. We have verified the algorithm by several applications on eight public data sets. Our original case was a case study, and it was also the reason why we developed the algorithm. However, implementation is in Python, and the algorithm itself can be used on a broader class of methods in any language. The algorithm iterates quickly, in all experiments we needed a maximum of 10 iterations. Possible enhancements to this algorithm are also outlined.

AB The study of influential spreaders has become a growing area of interest within network sciences due to its critical implications in understanding the robustness and vulnerability of complex networks. There is a significant degree of focus on the factors that dictate the decision-making process for identifying these influential spreaders in highly complex networks, given their crucial role in network performance and security. Previous research methodologies have offered a deep understanding of the importance of spreaders, also referred to as nodes. These methods, however, have primarily depended on either neighborhood or path information to identify these spreaders. They have often studied local network data, or adopted a more broad-based, global view of the network. Such an approach may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the overall network structure and the relationships between nodes. Addressing this limitation, our research introduces Neighborhood and Path Information-based Centrality (NPIC) algorithm. This innovative centrality algorithm combines both neighborhood and path information to identify influential spreaders in a complex network. By incorporating these two significant aspects, NPIC provides a more holistic analysis of network centrality, enabling a more accurate identification of influential spreaders. We have subjected NPIC to rigorous testing using numerous simulations on both real and artificially-created datasets. These simulations applied an epidemic model to calculate the spreading efficiency of each node within its given environment. Our simulations, conducted across a wide range of synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrated that NPIC outperforms existing methodologies in identifying influential spreaders in corresponding networks.

DE Anomaly detection; Unsupervised anomaly detection; Neural networks
AB Detecting anomalies in massive volumes of multivariate time series data, particularly in the IoT domain, is critical for maintaining stable systems. Existing anomaly detection models based on reconstruction techniques face challenges in distinguishing normal and abnormal samples from unlabeled data, leading to performance degradation. Moreover, accurately reconstructing abnormal values and pinpointing anomalies remains a limitation. To address these issues, we introduce the Adversarial Time-Frequency Reconstruction Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (ATF-UAD). ATF-UAD consists of a time reconstructor, a frequency reconstructor and a dual-view adversarial learning mechanism. The time reconstructor utilizes a parity sampling mechanism to weaken the dependency between neighboring points. Then attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are used to update the feature information for each point, which combines points with close feature relationships and dilutes the influence of abnormal points on normal points. The frequency reconstructor transforms the input sequence into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform and extracts the relationship between frequencies to reconstruct anomalous frequency bands. The dual-view adversarial learning mechanism aims to maximize the normal values in the reconstructed sequences and highlight anomalies and aid in their localization within the data. Through dual-view adversarial learning, ATFUAD minimizes reconstructed value errors and maximizes the identification of residual outliers. We conducted extensive experiments on nine datasets from different domains, and ATF-UAD showed an average improvement of 6.94% in terms of F1 score compared to the state-of-the-art method.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Graph data augmentations have demonstrated remarkable performance on homophilic graph neural networks (GNNs). Nevertheless, when transferred to a heterophilic graph, these augmentations are less effective for GNN models and lead to reduced performance. To address this issue, we propose a unified augmentation approach called GePHo, a regularization technique for heterophilic graph neural networks based on self-supervised learning, leveraging graph data augmentation to acquire extra information to guide model learning. Specifically, we propose to generate a pseudo-homophily graph that is type-agnostic, enabling us to apply GePHo to both homophilic and heterophilic graphs. Then, we regularize the neighbors with a sharpening technique for data augmentation and generate the auxiliary pseudo-labels to classify the original GNN's output, whose operations are to constrain the local and global node representation, respectively. Extensive experiments on three homophilic graph and six heterophilic graph datasets demonstrate the competitive effectiveness of GePHo in node classification task, and the ablation experiments verify the efficacy of our GePHo in graph data augmentation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Quantum neural network (QNN) is a neural network model based on the principles of quantum mechanics. The advantages of faster computing speed, higher memory capacity, smaller network size and elimination of catastrophic amnesia make it a new idea to solve the problem of training massive data that is difficult for classical neural networks. However, the quantum circuit of QNN are artificially designed with high circuit complexity and low precision in classification tasks. In this paper, a neural architecture search method EQNAS is proposed to improve QNN. First, initializing the quantum population after image quantum encoding. The next step is observing the quantum population and evaluating the fitness. The last is updating the quantum population. Quantum rotation gate update, quantum circuit construction and entirety interference crossover are specific operations. The last two steps need to be carried out iteratively until a satisfactory fitness is achieved. After a lot of experiments on the searched quantum neural networks, the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm proposed in this paper are proved, and the searched QNN is obviously better than the original algorithm. The classification accuracy on the mnist dataset and the warship dataset not only increased by 5.31% and 4.52%, respectively, but also reduced the parameters by 21.88% and 31.25% respectively.

AB Retrosynthesis and reaction outcome prediction are fundamental problems in organic chemistry and computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), which are also crucial parts of computer-aided drug design. In recent years, deep learning has spawned a branch of methods which use machine translation frameworks with SMILES data representation to solve these problems. With the successive introduction of additional inverted reaction data as well as the molecular graph representation, the accuracy and validity of machine-transaction-based approaches have been further improved. In this work, we propose a bidirectional graph-to-sequence model (BiG2S) that combines the benefits of inverted reaction training and graph representation. The proposed approach has the ability to provide high-quality retrosynthesis and forward synthesis prediction simultaneously on various datasets, which achieves 5.5% top-1 accuracy with only 0.1% invalid results on USPTO-50k retrosynthesis task, and maintain 85.0% top-1 accuracy for outcome prediction with the same model.

AB Reviewing and integrating decisions in the supply chain and project management is crucial. This problem is known as a project-driven supply chain problem. By the growing dependency of project-driven companies on suppliers since they prefer to concentrate on their core and subcontracting processes, the project-based organization's dependence on suppliers has increased. A project-driven supply chain (PDSC) focuses on integrating project management activities into the supply chain. In this paper, a new model is presented for the integration of supply chain and project management decisions. Firstly, a new method is proposed to determine the resilience score of suppliers. This new model consists of three parts: the weighting of criteria, the weighting of experts, and the ranking of suppliers. To give weight to the experts, a new version of the combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) method is presented based on the average and positive ideal concepts. Also, the importance of the criteria is specified by an expanded best-worst method (BWM). Computing the resilience score of suppliers is done through a developed CODAS method that is extended by the average and positive concepts. Furthermore, in order to consider the uncertainty of project-driven supply chain problems, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are used. Secondly, a new subtraction operation is defined to avoid producing negative in recursive critical path method (CPM) calculations in the IT2F environment. Also, the criticality score of the project's activities is defined. According to the criticality and resilience indexes of activities, suggestions are made to project management to prevent delays. Finally, a case study of hospital construction is solved to illustrate the strengths of the proposed model.

AB The black widow spider optimization algorithm is a new population optimization method, which shows strong advantages in solving complex problems and optimization. PV systems are multi-peaked in shading conditions, and traditional MPPT technology cannot successfully capture the global maximum power point. Therefore, this study proposes an MPPT control method based on IBWO. In this context, a GMPP tracking control strategy based on IBWO is proposed in this research. Considering the complexity of PV shading, six shading conditions are designed in this study to compare the performance of PSO, BWO, SSA and the proposed method. Taking into account the real climatic conditions of different seasons. The simulation results show that the proposed control method has the ability to track the global maximum power point, the efficiency is almost 100%, and the tracking time is about 0.2s. The verification results of the test platform show that the tracking efficiency of the proposed method reaches 98.75%. Experimental results show that the IBWO method can be used as a solution to the global optimization problem of MPPT, which can improve the tracking efficiency of PV system while accompanied with fast response time.

DE Personalized recommendation; Course recommendation; Reinforcement

AB Course recommendation technology plays a key role in online learning services. However, there are still two key issues that remain unresolved in practice. First, it is difficult to characterize learners' multiple preferences in various courses, while existing course recommendation methods are incompetent to address it. Second, there is a critical challenge to learn effective recommendation strategies due to the few labeled data, since online course resources usually include insufficient information about learners' behaviors (e.g., lack of ratings and comments). To deal with these issues, we propose a joint learning framework, namely multi-scale Reinforced Profile for Personalized Recommendation (RPPR). Specifically, we design a multi-scale deep reinforcement learning method to construct learners' multiple profiles according to coarse-grained and fine-grained semantics. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the recommendation strategies from limited interactive information, we develop an attention-based recommendation model with multivariable perceptron, which leverages related parameters of both neural networks and data structure to control the direction of loss optimization. Empirical results demonstrate that our RPPR significantly outperforms some competitive baselines on two real-world MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) datasets.

ID CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION
AB To improve the performance of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, we propose a novel approach (named ESOABC-EC&ACS). First, the existence of solutions outside the constrained region (ESO) is designed to explore the possibility of the search helped by these solutions, which facilitates exploring the boundary of the constrained region and obtaining optimal solutions faster. Then, an elite-centered search equation is proposed to balance exploration and exploitation. Finally, adaptive bee colony scaling is constructed to help convergence. Our approach is the combination of these three techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that ESOABC-EC&ACS outperforms other ABC variants and some non-ABC meta-heuristic algorithms on most of the test functions in terms of solution quality. And the proposed heuristic factor for the dynamic weapon target assignment problem can improve the optimization performance. The ESO is the first universal strategy proposed for the survival of solutions outside the constraint region (out-of-bounds) generated when solving various problems directly, which causes extended solution boundary and affects the exploration of the constrained region boundary.

DE Review helpfulness predication; External memory network; Self -attention
   mechanism; Deep matching network
AB With the explosive growth of reviews on e-commerce websites, consumers usually have trouble finding helpful information in massive reviews. Therefore, predicting review helpfulness has drawn the attention of researchers in the research community. Previous works have focused on identifying the helpfulness of reviews based on content, but we found that the helpfulness of a review is determined by the content of reviews and the matching degree between items and reviews. To meet this challenge, this paper proposes a deep matching model based on a feature-aware external memory network (DMMN) to predict review helpfulness. Specifically, the DMMN contains a memory matrix that can store typical features of items via memory reading/writing operations. We then derive item features by properly reading the memory matrix. Meanwhile, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to obtain review features. Finally, the helpfulness score of the review is acquired by the matching degree between item features and review features. Experiments conducted on Amazon datasets, compared with the baseline models, the DMMN obtains an about 1-2% performance improvement on the eight datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our efforts to predict helpful reviews are feasible and effective.

AB Autonomously sensing collision threats in intelligent mobile machines is a significant challenge. Inspired by the perfect collision sensing system of locusts, various neural networks based on lobular giant motion detectors (LGMD) have been proposed. These networks use integer-order differential operators to simulate the simple and efficient visual neural system of locusts. However, some biological studies have shown that the neurodynamics of neuronal response should be fractional-order, and fractional-order differential operators can accurately describe the biological logic brain neural response process. In view of this, firstly, this paper uses a fractional-order differential operator to simulate the membrane potential response of neurons, and a new fractional-order LGMD collision sensing visual neural network is proposed. This network is designed to accurately detect looming objects and generate reliable response spikes. Then, through experimental analysis, a range [0.36, 0.4] of order in the fractional-order system is given, which is considered to be a reasonable interval for modeling the behavior of biological nervous systems. This maybe contribute to the study of the locust's fractional-order biological nervous system. Finally, the network was systematically tested in noisy and complex dynamic environments. The experimental results demonstrated that the fractional-order LGMD visual neural network generated responses with high adaptability and reliability, showcasing significantly improved collision detection performance.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible central nervous degenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor state of AD. Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%similar to 15.2% and 3.4%similar to 26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD. These results indicate that DANMLP can be effectively used for diagnosing AD and MCI patients.

AB Modern data analysis allows to infer from the data to a very large extent. Particularly noteworthy are techniques based on the detection of anomalies in datasets. Unsupervised approaches with no labeled records are gaining ground. One of the most frequently used and efficient unsupervised methods is Isolation Forest (IF) with its numerous specialized modifications. The considerations of this paper are devoted to the enhancement of Minimal Spanning Tree-Based Isolation Forest (MSTBIF). MSTBIF exhibits high effectiveness. Its evaluation function consists of the sum of two parameters. Hence, the main motivation of the work is a better composition of the MSTBIF evaluation function parameters. Crucial improvements are made in two directions. Firstly, the output parameters related to the tree height and the distance to the nearest tree leaf are normalized. Normalizations take place in a new manner. The properties of created minimal spanning trees are used. Secondly, a simple aggregation of output parameters has been modified. The work introduces an innovative anomaly evaluation scheme. Namely, fuzzy rules prepared in the Takagi-Sugeno inference model are applied. Novel proposal allows for a more precise inference about the occurrence of anomalies in the considered elements. In order to compare the results, the AUC values are measured. A series of experiments with IF, MSTBIF, and new approach are carried out. The research results on the new proposal prove a significant refinement of the anomaly assessment. The improvement over MSTBIF is clearly noticeable. Compared to the basic IF method, the results are better by about 6%.

AB Feature selection plays an important role in removing noise and redundancy of data. Due to various uncertainties in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, such as noise, mutation, sparsity, etc., most of the existing feature selection methods for scRNA-seq data performed poorly. This paper has given some techniques that consider the above problems from the perspective of fuzzy evidence theory. First of all, a noise -robust fuzzy relation incorporating the decision attribute is defined because the decision attribute contains the most important information of data. Then, fuzzy evidence theory is introduced because it is good at handling the uncertainty of continuous data. Furthermore, the connection between fuzzy evidence theory and fuzzy rough set models has been established, which solves the problem of difficult calculation of fuzzy belief and fuzzy plausibility. In this framework, two noise-robust feature selection algorithms without any parameters for scRNA-seq data are proposed. Experiments on 12 scRNA-seq datasets show that the proposed algorithms are superior to the other four state-of-the-art algorithms in classification accuracy and noise-robust performance in the case of selecting fewer genes. Therefore, the proposed algorithms are noise-robust and objective while maintaining high gene selection efficiency and accuracy.

AB Despite the rapid advance of unsupervised reconstruction models in online service fault diagnosis, existing methods still lead to frequent false positive or false negative alarms. Tracing to the cause, popular reconstruction frameworks may fall into an "identical shortcut'', where both normal and anomalous cases can be well-recovered and hence faults are escaped from monitoring. Moreover, regularly "concept drift"deployed by online services always leads to sequences distribution dramatically change, which is easily wrongly-detected as anomalies. In this work, we present SS-Attention to avoid two contradictory false alarms simultaneously in a unified framework. Specifically, we first revisit the frameworks of MLP, CNN, and transformer, and confirm the important role of self-attention in preventing the model from learning shortcut, which we therefore select as our backbone. Second, we come up with a sparse attention layer to help model capture more long-term dependencies and distinguish local "concept drift"from anomalies. Third, we propose a semi-attention layer that urges model only learn from normal regions and further avoid well-recovering the faults. We evaluate our model on three public online service datasets and surpass the state-of-the-art alternatives by a sufficiently large margin, achieving an average 95.91% F1-Score with an approx. 34.48% economy of training time.

AB Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is an intensively used risk analysis technique for prioritizing failure modes of products, systems, and services. Traditionally, FMEA assumes deterministic and precise values for risk factors. In engineering scenarios, the observed values of decision-makers on risk factors are, however, potentially stochastic and imprecise in nature due to the lack of adequate knowledge and experience. On the other hand, the structural correlation between risks (or failure modes) and induced factors (e.g., the loss cost and recovery time of products, systems, and services) is rarely reported in FMEA. To this end, we develop a possibilistic chance-constrained data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework to overcome the above deficiencies. In this framework, three differentiated categories of DEA approaches (namely, series, parallel, and network structure DEA) are devised to characterize such structural correlation. More specially, the Me measure is introduced to handle imprecise parameters associated with risk factors. Simultaneously, decision-makers are endowed to express flexible attitudes on these imprecise parameters. Moreover, in order to reveal the mechanism of risk priority of failure modes, the proposed framework enables decision-makers to offer optimistic and pessimistic attitudes on risk input and propagation, respectively. A case study of a production system, along with some comparisons and discussions, is given to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed framework. As indicated from this case study, no matter which DEA approach is conducted, the risk priority of failure modes is stable in a stochastic environment. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Scientists studying in the fields of AI and neuroscience can learn much from each other, but unfortunately, since about the 1950s, it has been mostly one-sided: neuroscientists have learned from AI, but less so the other way. I argue this is holding back both brain understanding and progress in AI. Current AI ("neural network"/deep learning algorithms) and the brain are very different from each other. The brain does not seem to use trial-and-error-type learning algorithms such as backpropagation to modify weights and more importantly does not require the cumbersome rehearsal needed for trial-and-error implementation. The brain can learn information in a modular and true "one-shot" fashion as the information is encountered while the AI cannot. Instead of backpropagation and rehearsal, there is evidence that the brain regulates its inputs during recognition using regulatory feedback: form the outputs back to inputs-the same inputs that activate the outputs. This is observed through evidence from the fields of neuroscience and cognitive psychology but is not present in current algorithms. Thus, the brain provides an abundance of evidence about its underlying algorithms and while computer science tools and analysis are essential, algorithms guided by computer science should not be standardized into neuroscience theories.

AB This article introduces FLICs, a novel dataset designed for modeling informal language. Predominantly composed of text in Malagasy and French, FLICs were collected from Facebook and cleansed using Python scraping techniques. The aim is to address the lack of linguistic diversity in existing datasets by offering over 800,000 informal texts, enabling an understanding of current linguistic trends in informal communication. FLICs stands out for its inclusion of features characteristic of informal communication, such as abbreviations, dialects, slang, emoticons, and keywords. Moreover, it highlights the less-studied Malagasy language, used in an extremely informal manner and interwoven with French through code-switching. This linguistic variety opens new avenues for research in NLP, particularly in text comprehension, generation, and classification. To validate the new dataset, we employed FastText, a word embedding model, to capture word semantics within the corpus. Analyses demonstrated data relevance. Semantic relationships between words were faithfully captured using pre-trained FastText word embeddings. The informal word contexts were explored through clustering word vectors obtained using K-means and PCA. Subsequently, validation extended to utilizing pre-trained FastText embeddings in text generation with an LSTM model. This experiment confirmed the usefulness of embeddings in consistently and appropriately generating informal texts. In summary, these contributions enrich the available resources for research in natural language processing within the realm of informal language.

AB Advancements in the rapidly evolving specialization of deep learning have aided in improving several natural language understanding tasks. Sentiment and emotion classification models have improved, but when it comes to fine-grained sentiment analysis, these models can perform better. Human sentiment in natural language is generally an intricate combination of emotions, which can sometimes be indeterminate, neutral, or ambiguous. In the case of fine-grained sentiment analysis, the sentiments can be very similar to each other and interconnected, e.g., anger and fear. Most deep learning systems try to solve the problem of fine-grained sentiment analysis as a classification problem. However, fine-grained sentiments might combine similar emotions with one primary emotion. Trying to solve the problem as a classification task can result in better performance on benchmarks but does not ensure a better understanding and representation of language. The proposed work explores applying neutrosophy for fine-grained sentiment analysis using large language models. Neutrosophy identifies neutralities and employs membership functions (neutral, positive, negative) to quantify an instance into Single Valued Neutrosophic Sets (SVNS). This paper introduces Refined Emotion Neutrosophic Sets (RENS) for emotions (with four emotions) and Refined Ekman's Emotion Neutrosophic Sets (REENS) with seven emotions. In this paper, refined neutrosophic sets with membership functions are employed for each sentiment across a given taxonomy and assigned their values using the Neutrosophic Iterative Neural Clustering (NINC) algorithm proposed in this paper. It facilitates not only classifying sentiments but also quantifying the presence of each sentiment present in a given sample. It aids in better understanding and representation of samples across multiple sentiments, as in fine-grained sentiment analysis, experiments are performed on the GoEmotions dataset. The proposed approach performs on par with cross-entropy deep learning classifiers and is reproducible across different pre-trained language models.

AB Global urbanization has made the urban rail transit system an essential service for a growing population. To help urban rail transit stations design optimal operational plans, previous studies have devoted extensive efforts to passenger flow forecasting, especially short-term predictions. By considering the complex pattern of passenger flow, previous research investigated the feasibility of machine learning (ML) methods on different data features and found the limited application of a single ML method. Based on the dynamic historical passenger flow data at an urban rail station, this study proposes an ML-fusion strategy to enhance prediction accuracy, including data aggregation, time series forecasting model selection, and fusion model strategy. First, this study aggregates the data into working days, weekends, and hourly time series for single model development. Based on the predictive performance of single model development, this study selects XGBoost, AdaBoost, and LightGBM from the widely used ML-method pool. To overcome prediction errors caused by the discrepancy between characteristics of passenger flow and single prediction models, the proposed ML-fusion model combines single forecasting models with dynamically predicted passenger flow to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction. Based on the experimental results, the mean absolute error is 1.54, and the regression coefficient is 0.99, which is in close agreement with unity, which validates that the proposed ML-fusion method has displayed superiority over all other single models tested both in accuracy and stability.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The necessity of power is growing in response to today's growing population. In order to reduce both real and reactive power losses, three devices have been combined in this research. The distributed generations (DGs) and static var compensator (SVC) with static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) play important role for reduction of power losses (both real and reactive power) and improvement of voltage profile. The research outcome presented here outlines that presents genetic algorithm (GA) may be utilised to improve power system performance and voltage profile (VP) of distribution networks by integrating DG, SVC and STATCOM planning properly. On a 37-bus distribution network, the proposed methodology has been applied.

DE Dempster-Shafer evidence theory; Basic probability assignment; Interval

AB In the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, how to transform the objective data in reality into the basic probability assignment (BPA) is still an open issue. Based on this problem, a new method of generating BPA based on interval number distance model and reliability is proposed. First, construct the interval number model under each attribute. Second, calculate the interval number distance between the test sample and the interval number model and convert it into the initial basic probability assignment (IBPA). Thirdly, the final BPA is obtained by discounting the IBPA by constructing the comprehensive reliability from the static reliability and dynamic reliability of the interval number model. Finally, the Dempster combination rule is used to fuse the final BPA one by one, and the decision is made according to the fusion result. The ten-fold cross-validation results show that the classification accuracy under the three data sets is higher than other methods, and the classification accuracy of the Iris data set is 0.9733. At the same time, it is verified that the proposed method still has good effectiveness and robustness in the incomplete information environment.

AB The development of drone and computer vision technologies has enabled automated landscape image analysis, unlocking new feature extraction capabilities. This paper presents an integrated framework leveraging aerial drone data and machine learning for landscape imaging. A diverse dataset of drone-captured scenery spanning urban and rural areas provides the foundation. Preprocessing techniques ready the images before quantitative color analysis and texture feature extraction reveal topographical patterns. Structural boundaries are identified through edge detection and Hough transforms. Deep convolutional neural networks semantically segment images into classified landscape regions. Weighted color block matching retrieves similar images by prioritizing salient areas. Experiments demonstrate 95% accuracy in landscape feature classification, with precision of 0.93, recall of 0.95, and F1 score of 0.94, outperforming existing methods. Extracted color, texture, spectral, and geometric patterns enable interpretation of terrain, vegetation health, human-made objects, and ecological processes. The proposed approach facilitates monitoring, decision-making, and optimization across agriculture, urban planning, conservation, and other applications. Overall, the results validate that combining drones, computer vision, and deep learning can automate the analysis of complex landscape images to generate actionable insights. This methodology pioneers the next generation of intelligent remote sensing systems for comprehending our living environments.

AB Stock index forecasting has always been an interesting subject for investors and related scholars. Accurately stock index forecasting can provide some helpful suggestions for investors and keep financial markets stable. In this study, a new forecasting system, including point prediction and interval prediction, has been proposed to predict the stock index. For obtaining a better predictive effect, multiple influencing variables are also considered in the novel model. More specifically, in the point prediction models, this study applies gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) to choose some variables related to the stock index by determining their contribution to accurate prediction. Next, an autoencoder (AE) is utilized to reduce the dimensionality of screened factors for the purpose of reducing the effect of noise and improving the efficiency of forecasting. These reconstructed features are all inputted into bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to do point prediction. The interval prediction is based on point prediction results and Gaussian process regression (GPR), intended to quantitative uncertainty of the variables. This study chooses the Chinese stock index including the Shanghai Securities Composite Index (SSEC), Shenzhen Composite Index (SZI) and China Securities Index 300 (CSI300) to demonstrate the validity of the innovative hybrid model. Furthermore, this study also selects some other models for comparison. Evaluating the performance of the novel hybrid model, it could be considered as a valid way to do stock index forecasting.

AB In real-world decision-making problems, a group of decision-makers (DMs) with different levels of expertise gathers to investigate the problem from various perspectives. Making the best choice from an analogous shortlist of competitors is challenging, even for an expert group. To address these types of problems, a new multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) methodology under the interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy (IT2TrF) environment is proposed. The proposed IT2TrF MCGDM method comprises three phases. In the first phase, the IT2TrF cognitive best-worst method (IT2TrF-CBWM) is introduced to calculate the initial weights of criteria using the interval scale. Subsequently, a new consistency index (CI) and consistency ratio (CR) are presented. In the second phase, an optimization model is proposed to determine the final IT2TrF weights of criteria. Finally, a likelihood-based method for solving MCGDM problems is introduced in the third phase. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by addressing a healthcare waste (HCW) treatment technology selection problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sensitivity and comparative analyses highlight the superiority and effectiveness of the presented MCGDM method.

AB With progressing competitive market, different organizations were desperate to hold this churn rate as minimum value, hence to achieve this, building an effective (CCP) customer churn prediction model is essential. In order to address those issues in CCP, the study deliberated the churn prediction model using DFE-WUNB (Deep Feature Extraction with Weight Updated Tuned Naive Bayes classifier) in a cloud-computing environment. Due to the huge non-linear features of the Telco customer churn dataset, the pre-processed features are deeply learned by the subsequent two models of ANN. In ANN, the input feature gets multiplied by the weight value, and the resultant output feature passes to the next dense layer in ANN. The deep feature extraction in ANN models facilitates precise accuracy in determining relevant churn features. However, the higher matrix dimensions of features exhibit complexity in prediction, hence this Block Jacobi SVD algorithm is applied to decrease the dimensions of features, such as to create a sparse dataset projected to get fit to the training model for efficient classification. The dimension-reduced features pass through enhanced weighing Naive Bayes algorithm gets updated with ANN weights and tunes the parameters having greater and best weights to NB classifier, improvising the classification accuracy performance. The comparative assessment of the proposed DFE-WUNB churn prediction model delineated the efficiency of highly accurate churn prediction, outperforming other conventional churn prediction models.

AB Gearboxes operate in harsh environments. Cloud-based techniques have been previously adopted for fault diagnosis in Gearboxes. Cloud-based fault diagnosis methods are prone to time delays and loss of information. Therefore, edge computing-based fault diagnosis becomes an option. However, with limited hardware resources for edge devices, balancing the diagnostic capabilities of the model with operating performance becomes a challenge. This paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network for gearbox fault diagnosis in edge computing scenarios to achieve an accurate diagnosis and lightweight deployment of models. By constructing the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature matrix of input data, the methodology can suppress noise interference and improve diagnostic accuracy. Based on the structural re-parameterization, the model structure transforms from multiple branches at training time to a single branch at inference time. This improves the inference speed of the model and reduces the hardware cost when the model is deployed while ensuring that the diagnostic capability of the model remains unchanged. Validation experiments were conducted on a public dataset and a custom experimental device, using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit as the edge computing platform. According to the experiment result, after extracting the MFCC feature matrix, the average diagnostic accuracy rate in the noisy environment of the presented methodology is improved by 12.22% and 9.44%, respectively. After structural re-parameterization, the Memory of the model decreases by 52.58%, and the inference speed is increased by 38.83%.

AB The absorption and scattering properties of the water medium cause various types of distortion in underwater images, which seriously affects the accuracy and effectiveness of subsequent processing. The application of supervised learning algorithms in underwater image enhancement is limited by the difficulty of obtaining a large number of underwater paired images in practical applications. As a solution, we propose an unsupervised representation disentanglement based underwater image enhancement method (URD-UIE). URD-UIE disentangles content information (e.g., texture, semantics) and style information (e.g., chromatic aberration, blur, noise, and clarity) from underwater images and then employs the disentangled information to generate the target distortion-free image. Our proposed method URD-UIE adopts an unsupervised cycle-consistent adversarial translation architecture and combines multiple loss functions to impose specific constraints on the output results of each module to ensure the structural consistency of underwater images before and after enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that the URD-UIE technique effectively enhances the quality of underwater images when training with unpaired data, resulting in a significant improvement in the performance of the standard model for underwater object detection and semantic segmentation.

AB Unsupervised sentence embedding learning is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Recently, unsupervised contrastive learning based on pre-trained language models has shown impressive performance in sentence embedding learning. This method aims to align positive sentence pairs while pushing apart negative sentence pairs to achieve semantic uniformity in the representation space. However, most previous literature leverages a random strategy to sample negative pairs, which suffers from the risk of selecting uninformative negative examples (e.g., easily distinguishable examples, anisotropic representations), thus greatly affecting the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose nmCSE, a negative mining contrastive learning method for sentence embedding. Specifically, we introduce distance moderation and spatial uniformity as two properties of informative negative examples, and devise distance-based weighting and grid sampling as two strategies to preserve these properties, respectively. Our proposal outperforms the random strategy across seven semantic textual similarity datasets. Furthermore, our method can easily be adapted to other contrastive learning scenarios (e.g., vision), and does not introduce significant computational overhead.

DE Neural ODE; Dense prediction; Transformer
AB Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) represent an emergent class of deep learning models exhibiting continuous depth. While they have shown promising results across various machine learning tasks, existing methods for dense prediction tasks have not fully harnessed their potential, often due to employing sub-optimal architectural components and limited dataset studies. To address this, our paper introduces a robust neural ODE architecture specifically tailored for dense prediction tasks and performs an extensive evaluation across a broad range of datasets. Our approach draws upon proven design elements from top-performing networks, integrating transformer blocks as core building blocks. Unique to our design is the retention of multiple concurrent representations at varying resolutions throughout the network. These representations continually exchange information, ensuring they remain updated. Our network achieves unrivaled performance in tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and answer grounding. We conduct several ablation studies to shed light on the impacts of various design parameters. Our results affirm the effectiveness of our approach and its potential for further advancements in dense prediction tasks.

AB When using untrusted third parties to compress and transmit images in real-life scenarios, it is vital to encrypt them before compression. In order to better address the issues of low security in the original image and poor reconstruction quality of the encrypted image during compressed sensing, this paper proposes a 2D compressed sensing scheme for encrypted images based on complex-valued measurement matrix (2DCS-CVM). Firstly, the SHA-256 algorithm generates keys for the hyperchaotic Lorenz system, and then the chaotic sequences are used to create encrypted images with increased security through subtractive diffusion and global permutation. Secondly, the complex-valued Vandermonde measurement matrix is utilized for 2D compressed sensing on the encrypted image, and the two-dimensional projected gradient with embedding decryption algorithm is used to generate recovered images with improved reconstruction performance. Finally, the measurement matrix's computational complexity and transmission bandwidth are reduced through structural sparsification with sparse random matrices. Simulation results demonstrate that this scheme offers an optimal balance between storage, computational complexity, hardware implementation, and reconstruction performance while providing excellent security and robustness.
   In order to enhance privacy by encrypting images before compressed transmission, this paper proposes a 2D compressed sensing scheme based on a hyperchaotic Lorenz system and complex-valued Vandermonde measurement matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that the reconstruction performance of this scheme is highly superior to that of the encryption-then-compression scheme proposed recently. The hyperchaotic system for subtractive diffusion and global permutation significantly reduces the correlation of the encrypted image, improving security by key space and robustness.image

AB Automated detection of depression using Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has become a promising application in advanced bioinformatics technology. Although current methods have achieved high detection performance, several challenges still need to be addressed: (1) Previous studies do not consider data redundancy when modeling multi-channel EEG signals, resulting in some unrecognized noise channels remaining. (2) Most works focus on the functional connection of EEG signals, ignoring their spatial proximity. The spatial topological structure of EEG signals has not been fully utilized to capture more fine-grained features. (3) Prior depression detection models fail to provide interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new model, Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning via Adaptive Channel Optimization (MGCL-ACO) for depression detection in EEG signals. Specifically, the proposed model first selects the critical channels by maximizing the mutual information between tracks and labels of EEG signals to eliminate data redundancy. Then, the MGCL-ACO model builds two similarity metric views based on functional connectivity and spatial proximity. MGCL-ACO constructs the feature extraction module by graph convolutions and contrastive learning to capture more fine-grained features of different perspectives. Finally, our model provides interpretability by visualizing a brain map related to the significance scores of the selected channels. Extensive experiments have been performed on public datasets, and the results show that our proposed model outperforms the most advanced baselines. Our proposed model not only provides a promising approach for automated depression detection using optimal EEG signals but also has the potential to improve the accuracy and interpretability of depression diagnosis in clinical practice.

AB Seizure prediction can improve the quality of life for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. With the rapid development of deep learning, lots of seizure prediction methods have been proposed. However, seizure prediction based on single convolution models is limited by the inherent defects of convolution itself. Convolution pays attention to the local features while underestimates the global features. The long-term dependence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) data cannot be captured. In view of these defects, a hybrid model called STCNN based on Swin transformer (ST) and 2D convolutional neural network (2DCNN) is proposed. Time-frequency features extracted by short-term Fourier transform (STFT) are taken as the input of STCNN. ST blocks are used in STCNN to capture the global information and long-term dependencies of EEGs. Meanwhile, the 2DCNN blocks are adopted to capture the local information and short-term dependent features. The combination of the two blocks can fully exploit the seizure-related information thus improve the prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments are performed on the CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset. The average seizure prediction sensitivity, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the false positive rate (FPR) are 92.94%, 95.56% and 0.073, respectively.

ID OBJECT TRACKING; FUTURE
AB Nano-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been attracting growing attention from both academia and industry with their compact and versatile nature. With the size of merely several centimeters, they are particularly well-suited for executing targeted missions in confined spaces, such as tracking a single pedestrian indoors. However, due to strict constraints on payload and power consumption, the onboard computing unit of nano-UAV is limited to the microcontroller Unit (MCU), which makes the novel single object tracking algorithms not applicable on nano-UAV platform. In this paper, we present a lightweight single pedestrian tracking algorithm to meet the strict resource constraints of nano-UAV system. The algorithm consists of an object detection frontend and amotion-based tracking backend. Based on our deployment methodology, covering from dataset production, model training to layer fusion and deployment, the proposed algorithm achieves extreme complexity reduction (13x fewer operations and 106x less memory), and keeps good tracking performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) research work. The full range of onboard experiments illustrate the efficiency our algorithm for real-time tracking (up to 43 fps). Meanwhile, both high computing efficiency (5.2MACs/cycle) and energy efficiency (5.3 mJ/frame) are achieved and exceed similar works on nano-UAV.

DE Uncrewed autonomy; DNN; Computer vision; Autonomous aerial refueling
AB Uncrewed aircraft deployed on aircraft carriers will be expected to have ever-increasing levels of autonomous functionality in the near future. This work presents early progress toward the certification of an uncrewed system to exhibit autonomous behavior while acting as the receiver during probe and drogue aerial refueling. The paper focuses on using a computer vision-based approach for identifying a drogue deployed by a tanker aircraft and determining its relative position to the refueling probe tip of the receiver. This will be critical if a vision-based solution will eventually feed into the control loop for the uncrewed system. This research used a fleet representative refueling drogue and probe. A computer vision system installed at the base of the refueling probe was used to feed imagery to a deep neural network trained to identify the refueling drogue and determine the drogue's position relative to the probe tip. Ground truth experiments validated via a motion capture system demonstrated that the error in relative position measurements was within tolerances to allow the deep neural network to be used in feedback control for a notional uncrewed system. Finally, the laboratory-trained deep neural network demonstrated its ability to identify the drogue outside of the laboratory with mission-representative backgrounds.

AB For the problem of dynamic contact force tracking control under physical human-robot interaction (pHRI), we propose a dual closed-loop adaptive decentralized control framework. The dynamic model of modular robot manipulator (MRM) subsystem is established based on joint torque feedback (JTF) technology. On the basis of fully analyzing the model uncertainty, the method based on decomposition is used to dynamically compensate the model uncertainty. Using Lyapunov theory, the uniform and ultimate boundedness (UUB) of dynamic contact force tracking error and MRM position tracking error in pHRI process are confirmed. A neural network (NN) observer is designed to dynamically compensate the uncertainty of controller. Finally, the effectiveness of this method is verified by experiments.

   Approach; Dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy; B-spline
AB This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm to complete path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance in complicated maps for mobile robot. The hybrid algorithm (A*-DWA-B) combines the advantages of A* algorithm and Dynamic Window Approach (DWA). Firstly, methods of environmental modeling and collision detection are set. The improvement of A* algorithm lies in the establishment of a new calculation method for the evaluation function. After adding the risky cost, the parent node information is introduced into the calculation of the estimated cost, and the influence of the robot starting and braking modes is added to the calculation of the actual cost. Secondly, after removing superfluous nodes, the path obtained by the improved A* algorithm is divided into several linear segment paths. Then the endpoints of each line segment path are taken as the start node and target node of DWA for path planning. Adaptive initial attitude is set and two dynamic obstacle avoidance strategies are added for DWA. After integrating the paths planned by DWA, the B-spline smoothing method is used to optimize the integrated path, and finally obtained a smooth path. Compared with other similar algorithms, the proposed algorithm has advantages in path cost and turning angle. Experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm not only has strong ability of safe and smooth path planning, but also can avoid dynamic obstacles in time and effectively.

AB Neural networks inspired by differential equations have proliferated for the past several years, of which neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) are two representative examples. In theory, NCDEs exhibit better representation learning capability for time-series data than NODEs. In particular, it is known that NCDEs are suitable for processing irregular time-series data. Whereas NODEs have been successfully extended to adopt attention, methods to integrate attention into NCDEs have not yet been studied. To this end, we present attentive neural controlled differential equations (ANCDEs) for time-series classification and forecasting, where dual NCDEs are used: one for generating attention values and the other for evolving hidden vectors for a downstream machine learning task. We conduct experiments on 5 real-world time-series datasets and 11 baselines. After dropping some values, we also conduct experiments on irregular time-series. Our method consistently shows the best accuracy in all cases by non-trivial margins. Our visualizations also show that the presented attention mechanism works as intended by focusing on crucial information.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Super-resolution (SR) is a powerful technique for enhancing the quality of remote sensing imagery, which in turn can improve the accuracy of various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, classification, and segmentation. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated significant progress in this field, and attention mechanisms are widely adopted in deep CNNs as they allow the models to assign weights to important areas within the feature map. In this paper, we propose the channel-wise gated attention (CGA) module, which integrates attention across the feature map channels and scales the resulting feature map through a gating parameter, leading to performance improvements. Furthermore, we present an SR framework that employs multiple attention blocks, with the CGA module serving as the core of each block, to enhance the spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery. Our proposed network, the channel-wise gated attention Network (CGA-Net), outperforms other attention-based deep SR models for 4x- and 8x-upsampling on two remote sensing datasets: Satellite Imagery Multi-Vehicles Dataset (SIMD), consisting of 5000 high-resolution remote sensing images, and DOTA, a large-scale satellite imagery dataset. We conduct several experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our SR framework for object detection on the SIMD dataset. The code and trained weights for the proposed framework can be found at this link: https://github.com/Vision-At-SEECS/CGA-Net.

AB Predicting energy costs and energy generation in traditional power grids is a complex endeavour, primarily due to the imperative of maintaining supply-demand equilibrium for upholding the stability of the power system. Predicting energy costs and generation includes the highly variable nature of energy prices and the need to analyze large amounts of data from various sources. We propose an auto-executable blockchain-based peer-to-peer(P2P) energy transaction market with a Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to address challenges in the energy sector. LSTM can handle non-linear relationships and can effectively model and predict the complex patterns that arise in energy markets. Our energy market enables accurate energy consumption and production prediction, facilitates decentralized and sustainable energy trading, and balances supply and demand via smart contracts. A secure and efficient blockchain-based P2P energy transaction market is designed to facilitate transactions in smart grids. The integrated system is a novel contribution that can improve energy systems' efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. Our experiments show that our proposed energy market can reduce the electricity buying budget by 17.68% compared to the traditional market and 41.36% compared to the open loop look ahead dispatch method for 30 microgrids and the utility.

AB This paper deals with the design and Hardware In Loop (HIL) verification of a novel intelligent Super-twisting Sliding Mode Speed Controller (STSMSC) based on a Sugeno-Takagi Fuzzy Logic System (STFLS) for an induction motor controlled by an improved Modified Direct Torque Control (MDTC) approach. Indeed, Conventional Super-twisting Sliding Mode Speed Controller (CSTSMSC) is chosen as an alternative solution for attenuating the chattering phenomenon brought on by the discontinuous control law of the First Order Sliding Mode Speed Control (FOSMSC) and maintaining its advantages like simplicity, robustness and accuracy. Moreover, the STSMSC is a type of a second order sliding mode control technique that needs only the information about the sliding surface, not its time derivative. However, the choice parameters of the CSTSMSC existing in the control law effects the tracking accuracy, the overshoot and the amplitude of the chattering. Therefore, an STSMSC based on an STFLS (STFLS-STSMSC) is proposed for online tuning of these parameters in transient and steady state operations. In fact, the STFLS is considered as an intelligent supervisor to adjust these parameter values according to the system state, which consequently provides excellent performance consisting in a higher robustness rate under disturbances and uncertainties, tracking with excellent accuracy and reduced chattering in steady state and transient operations. Numerous simulation and HIL co-simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested STFLS-STSMSC based MDTC implemented on a Xilinx FPGA Zynq 7000 SoC ZC702.

ID APPROXIMATION; GRADIENT
AB In nonlinear regression with machine learning methods, neural networks (NNs) are ideally suited due to their universal approximation property, which states that arbitrary nonlinear functions can thereby be approximated arbitrarily well. Unfortunately, this property also poses the problem that data points with measurement errors can be approximated too well and unknown parameter subspaces in the estimation can deviate far from the actual value (so-called overfitting). Various developed methods aim to reduce overfitting through modifications in several areas of the training. In this work, we pursue the question of how an NN behaves in training with respect to overfitting when linear and nonlinear transfer functions (TF) are alternated in different hidden layers (HL). The presented approach is applied to a generated dataset and contrasted to established methods from the literature, both individually and in combination. Comparable results are obtained, whereby the common use of purely nonlinear transfer functions proves to be not recommended generally.

AB This paper proposes an adaptive PID neural network (PIDNN) controller for direct and quadrature voltage control of three-phase inverters for islanded microgrids. A hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm is proposed for the initial weight selection of the proposed PIDNN controller using a discrete time simulation model incorporating the nonlinearity of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) or metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) switches of the inverter. The proposed hybrid optimization (HO) approach is a combination of population extremal optimization (PEO) and genetic algorithm (GA). It turned out that the proposed HO-PIDNN control scheme excelled the PEO, GA, and particle swarm optimization-based PIDNN controllers in terms of the objective function value, which is composed of the integral time absolute tracking error of the output voltage and a chattering penalty factor. Also, the control system outperformed the model reference adaptive PID control technique from the literature. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SAMPLE CONSENSUS; IMAGE; ALGORITHM
AB Image feature matching, which aims to establish correspondence between two images, is an important task in computer vision. Among image feature matching, the removal of mismatches is crucial to ensure the correctness of the matches. In recent years, machine learning has become a new perspective for mismatch removal. However, existing learning-based methods require a large amount of image data for training, which shows a lack of generalizability and is hard to deal with cases with high mismatch ratio. In this paper, we induce the triangular topology constraint into machine learning, where topology constraints around the matching points are summarized; combining with the idea of sampling, we achieve the task of removing mismatches. Topology constraints are studied in spite of the image input; our LTM (learning topology for matching) just needs fewer than 20 parameters as input, so that only ten training image pairs from four image sets involving about 3,000 matches are employed to train; it still achieves promising results on various datasets with different machine learning approaches. The experimental results of this study also demonstrate the superior performance of our LTM over existing methods.

AB The rise of the sharing economy (SE) has enabled new forms of urban mobility and had a substantial impact on the transportation sector. The applications of SE transportation lessen vehicle ownership and single-occupancy vehicles, which contributes to the sustainability of a region. Metaverse is a digital ecosystem that integrates SE applications with transportation sector and improves the sustainability of SE applications. The aim of this work is to assess and prioritize the Metaverse integration options of sharing economy from multiple criteria and uncertainty perspectives. In this regard, the proposed study develops a four stage decision-making method on interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) setting. First, new score function is proposed to compare the interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (IVPFNs) and further used to derive the weights of decision experts in the proposed method. Second, some IVPF interaction aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the individual's information in group decision-making. Third, an integrated weighting process is presented to obtain the objective weights of criteria using cross entropy-based formula and subjective weights by relative closeness coefficient-based model with IVPF information. For this purpose, a cross entropy is introduced for interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Fourth, a hybrid operational competitiveness ratings assessment (OCRA) model is developed to rank the alternatives with IVPF information. Moreover, a case study of Metaverse integration options of sharing economy in transportation sector is taken to express the practicability and effectiveness of the presented method. Sensitivity analysis with respect to various values of parameter is discussed to reveal the stability of outcomes. It is also compared with some extant models to validate the superiority of developed method. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Numerous optimization problems in the real world involve multi-objective and computationally expensive simulations (i.e., expensive multi-objective optimization problems). This paper purposes a dual surrogates-assisted evolutionary algorithm (SAEA) based on parallel search, termed DSAEA-PS, for this issue. Approximation and classification are two main implementation forms of surrogate models, but the existing methods of expensive multi-objective optimization only apply one kind of them, and scarce works have paid attention to combining approximation and classification to improve the optimization performance. In the proposed algorithm, to enhance the prediction accuracy and reliability, both the approximation model and classification model are applied to cooperate to provide the quality and uncertainty information of candidate solutions. Meanwhile, the parallel search based on heterogeneous multi-objective evolutionary algorithms is introduced for better exploration of the decision space. In addition, combined with the strengthened dominance relation (SDR), a sampling strategy that comprehensively considers the quality of candidate solutions and their uncertainty information is proposed. Experimental results with five peer competitors on a set of widely-used benchmark problems demonstrate the ability of DSAEA-PS. Furthermore, DSAEA-PS is adopted for a five-objective blended wing-body underwater glider design problem that involves time-consuming simulations of fluid dynamics and structural strength. A series of high-performance solutions obtained from DSAEA-PS verifies its effectiveness on engineering applications.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT
AB In deployed wireless sensor networks (WSNs), how to efficiently transmit information collected by sensor nodes with limited energy is a challenging problem. An appropriate cluster head selection strategy can efficiently solve this problem, but there are many factors to be considered, such as energy consumption, the coverage of cluster head nodes, and the number of cluster head nodes. Each factor has a profound impact on the performance of wireless sensor networks, and there are conflicts among them. In order to solve the conflict of multiple factors and obtain the optimal selection strategy of the cluster head node, this paper proposes a Binary Multi-Objective Adaptive Fish Migration Optimization (BMAFMO) algorithm. The algorithm introduces the Pareto optimal solution storage strategy to improve the global search ability of the optimization algorithm and transform the continuous solution into a binary solution according to the sigmoid transformation function to solve the problem of cluster head node selection. The new algorithm was comprehensively tested using eight test problems and four test metrics. At the same time, the reliability of the algorithm is tested by rank sum test. The test results show that the BMAFMO algorithm obtained the best results in 78.13% test problems compared with other algorithms. Finally, the BAMFMO algorithm is applied to solve the cluster head selection problem of WSN and the simulation results show the novel algorithm has better optimization ability than other heuristic algorithms.

AB This paper proposes a deep learning approach for solving non-smooth convex optimization problems (NCOPs), which have broad applications in computer science, engineering, and physics. Our approach combines neurodynamic optimization with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to provide an efficient and accurate solution. We first use neurodynamic optimization to formulate an initial value problem (IVP) that involves a system of ordinary differential equations for the NCOP. We then introduce a modified PINN as an approximate state solution to the IVP. Finally, we develop a dedicated algorithm to train the model to solve the IVP and minimize the NCOP objective simultaneously. Unlike existing numerical integration methods, a key advantage of our approach is that it does not require the computation of a series of intermediate states to produce a prediction of the NCOP. Our experimental results show that this computational feature results in fewer iterations being required to produce more accurate prediction solutions. Furthermore, our approach is effective in finding feasible solutions that satisfy the NCOP constraint.

DE Unsupervised machine learning; Neural network; Activation function;
   Optimizer; Singularly perturbed delay differential equation
AB In this paper, we explore a deep learning feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) framework as a numerical tool for approximating the solutions to singularly perturbed delay differential equations (SPDDE). Our approach trains the network with fewer uniform data points along with linear interpolation as a dependent variable. More importantly, the exact solution is not used for training the network. A mean square or Euclidean norm type total loss function is utilized to assess the deep learning network's performance. In the training and testing phase, our network adjusts itself to fit the tangent and the curvature by minimizing the total loss function and fine-tuning the network's hyperparameters during the backpropagation stage. Our focus in this contribution is to investigate an answer to the question-"whether neural networks can learn to solve the differential equations with both delay and boundary layer behavior"? Traditional numerical methods are known to perform poorly in approximating the solutions to SPDDE due to boundary layer behavior, which is the sharp change in the gradient of the solution inside a region of very small width. Our proposed network architecture is used to investigate the above question for three varieties of SPDDE. The numerical results demonstrate that the fine-tuned adaptive deep learning architecture can effectively approximate the solution to SPDDE for varieties of delay and perturbation parameters. It is expected that the current method can be extendable to approximate 2D convection-diffusion partial differential equations with a boundary layer.

AB Class incremental learning requires models to learn new-class knowledge without forgetting old-class in-formation. As a natural solution, the parallel one-class framework (POC) has attracted extensive attention. However, POC is prone to suffer the problem of lacking comparability between classifiers due to their inconsistent output distributions. To address this drawback, we propose an incremental learning method based on Identically Distributed Parallel One-class Classifiers (IDPOC). The core of IDPOC is a novel one-class classifier with Gaussian distributed output, referred to as Deep-SVD2D. Deep-SVD2D encourages the distribution of sample representations to follow the standard multivariate Gaussian. Consequently, the distance between the representation and its class center will approximately follow a chi-square distribution with some freedom degree. IDPOC further eliminates the freedom degree to ensure the output of all classifiers to follow an identical distribution, thus enhancing the comparability between different classifiers. We evaluate IDPOC on four popular benchmarks: MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that IDPOC achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., it outperforms the best baseline by 1.6% and 2.8% on two large-scale benchmarks of CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively 1.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing awareness and acceptance of the concept of green environmental protection among the public, primarily due to the worsening environmental issues and increased emphasis by governments on corporate social responsibility regulations. As a result, the management of closed-loop supply chains has gained significant attention from both businesses and researchers. Most stochastic programming models addressing closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) under uncertainty are typically designed to be risk-neutral. In this paper, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming (RATSSP) model for the closed-loop supply chain network design (CLSCND) problem considering facility capacity level decisions under uncertain demand. It is aiming to trade off the expected total profit and the profit risk, based on a given degree of responsive risk aversion. Due to the NP-hard nature of the CLSCND problem, this paper applies simplified swarm optimization (SSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to solve the problem. To improve the efficiency and quality of the obtained solutions, we propose a parallel computation meta heuristic algorithm, parallel simplified swarm optimization (PSSO), along with parallel versions of PSO and GA. Computational results show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with PSSO demonstrating the best robustness and solution quality among the considered algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The heat storage through Phase change material (PCM) is important for sustainable development. Previously a set of experiments were carried out on 14.5 kg of PCM, Magnesium chloride hexa hydrate in a shell and tube heat exchanger. The results are used to build machine learning and deep learning models such as Support vector machine, Random forest, Extreme gradient boost, Catboost and Artificial neural network to replicate the experiment virtually. The input variables are heat transfer fluid's inlet and outlet temperature and time elapsed while PCM's temperature is predicted in both charging and discharging cycles. The hyperparameter tuning is done using hyperband. Catboost model outperformed all other models with highest variance in both the cycles (0.9945 and 0.9299) and highest score: 0.993 and 0.9466. It has got the lowest MAPE (0.2% and 0.1 %). Hence this model can be recommended over these other models for doing system simulation of problems involving both charging and discharging cycles of the PCM.

AB The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) has extensively used to handle the uncertainty of real-life decision making problems. The aim of this study is to propose an integrated multicriteria group decision making (MCGDM) approach with intuitionistic fuzzy information and apply to select the most suitable renewable energy source with respect to multiple aspects of sustainability criteria. For this purpose, we firstly propose an improved distance measure to quantify the degree of difference between IFSs. Some numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed measure over the existing distance measures under the context of IFS. Further, we develop a weighting approach to find the criteria weights, which combines the objective weighting model using improved distance measure and the subjective weighting model using stepwise weighted assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Based on the proposed criteria weighting model, we develop an integrated weighted aggregated sum product assessment (IF-WASPAS) approach for solving MCGDM problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. To prove the applicability and efficacy of the developed approach, we implement it on a case study of renewable energy source selection problem with multiple aspects of sustainability including technical, socio-political, environmental, and economic perspectives. Moreover, the sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to examine the feasibility and steadiness of introduced approach in order to assess the RES options. In this paper, we present an improved decision making approach, which makes a significant contribution to the renewable energy sources evaluation process with uncertainty.

AB Real-world decision-making challenges tend to evolve into more intricate scenarios over time. In this context, the Fermatean fuzzy set emerges as an efficient and convenient framework, adept at illustrating the uncertainties inherent in multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems. To address decision-making challenges intertwined with uncertainties, the fundamental objective of this study is to develop a Fermatean fuzzy MCDM tool. This tool aims to expand users' scope to articulate their opinions and viewpoints. As a preliminary step, the study begins by elucidating the computation of the degree of proximity between the optimal alternative and its counterparts. This article presents the concept, representation, and pertinent characteristics of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (CC) within the context of Fermatean fuzzy sets. Subsequent to this, a multi-criteria decision-making technique, fortified by incorporating Fermatean fuzzy operators (FFOs), is formulated based on the proposed Spearman rank CC. Ultimately, we demonstrate the significance and efficacy of the introduced approach by showcasing its application in a real-world context, specifically within the domain of supplier selection decision-making. The results revealed that the primary advantage of the provided decision rule lies in its potential to effectively reduce production costs and streamline complexity within the context of supplier selection problems, both in theory and practical application. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in delivering reliable outcomes through a comprehensive analysis of FFOs and a comparative assessment against established techniques. A concrete case study is employed to firmly establish the stability and credibility of FFOs when combined with the Spearman rank CC. Additionally, this study carefully conducts a comprehensive comparative evaluation, comparing the previously developed methods with the newly proposed approach. This reinforces the robustness and authenticity of the FFO-based methodology and highlights its unique and practical nature.

AB Several existing group decision-making strategies and their hybrid models, such as soft expert sets (SESs), dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs), and hesitant fuzzy SESs, have proven to be valuable in resolving issues of many daily-life situations involving uncertainty. However, the hybridization of different existing uncertainty theories, particularly DHFSs and SESs, remains unexplored in the literature. To further enhance decision-making capabilities, the specific goal of this study is to extend the DHFS model to its extreme within the soft expert framework. For achieving this, we combine DHFSs with SESs as a new hybrid model called dual hesitant fuzzy soft expert sets (DHFSESs) to better handle uncertain situations in group decision-making. Furthermore, we investigate some basic properties and operations of the developed model and explain these notions with corresponding numerical examples, such as subset relation, complement, union, intersection, the 'OR' operation, the 'AND' operation, and level SESs of the developed DHFSESs. Additionally, we verify that the presented model obeys commutative, associative, and De Morgan's laws. To demonstrate the practicality of the DHFSES model, we solve a real-world multi criteria group decision-making problem (prediction of results in an upcoming local election scenario) by incorporating dual hesitant fuzzy soft expert knowledge that is supported by an algorithm. Finally, we evaluate the authenticity and feasibility of the proposed DHFSES model by comparing it with some preexisting approaches, including dual hesitant fuzzy soft sets and hesitant fuzzy SESs, to validate its advantages over them.

AB Cluster analysis is a crucial issue in multivariate statistics and data science due to its application in various fields. This study proposes a cutting-edge clustering algorithm for image data with important improvements. First, we extract the texture features from each image and represent them as two-dimensional intervals, which serve as effective input data for recognizing similarities between images. Subsequently, we introduce a measure called overlap distance for evaluating the similarity between intervals in multi-dimensional cases. Furthermore, the study develops an automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm specifically designed for images. This algorithm addresses multiple challenges simultaneously, including determining the appropriate number of clusters, identifying specific elements within clusters, and estimating the probability of each element belonging to clusters. In addition, the study implements a Matlab program to test the effectiveness and practical applications of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained from the proposed algorithm outperform those of current methods when applied to datasets with variations in the number of elements, fields, and characteristics of images.

DE Infinite domains; Projectivity; Structured model; Statistical relational
   artificial intelligence; Lifted probabilistic inference
AB The behaviour of statistical relational representations across differently sized domains has become a focal area of research from both a modelling and a complexity viewpoint. Recently, projectivity of a family of distributions emerged as a key property, ensuring that marginal probabilities are independent of the domain size. However, the formalisation used currently assumes that the domain is characterised only by its size. This contribution extends the notion of projectivity from families of distributions indexed by domain size to functors taking extensional data from a database. This makes projectivity available for the large range of applications taking structured input. We transfer key known results on projective families of distributions to the new setting. This includes a characterisation of projective fragments in different statistical relational formalisms as well as a general representation theorem for projective families of distributions. Furthermore, we prove a correspondence between projectivity and distributions on countably infinite domains, which we use to unify and generalise earlier work on statistical relational representations in infinite domains. Finally, we use the extended notion of projectivity to define a further strengthening, which we call sigma-projectivity, and which allows the use of the same representation in different modes while retaining projectivity.

AB Graph representation learning methods have gained great popularity in tackling various analytics tasks, such as node classification, link prediction and graph classification. However, most of graph representation learning methods merely consider the local information around the nodes. In addition, information about the global relative position information of each node is not fully taken into account. Recently, Position-aware Graph Neural Networks have been proposed to capture positions of nodes with respect to the anchor nodes and embed this position information into the feature representation, which aims to distinguish nodes which are locally structurally similar. This network aggregates position information from the randomly sampled anchor set nodes to the given target node. With such randomness, the sampled nodes lack particularity, and not all of them are significant enough in the graph to be used as position reference points. To address these issues, we propose a Position and Structure-aware Graph Learning framework (PSGL). The proposed PSGL extracts local topology information of nodes through the structure representation module, obtains anchor set nodes through graph pooling and further calculates global position information of the nodes to each anchor set node. The attention mechanism is used to weigh the obtained local topology and the global position information adaptively. Our proposed PSGL is capable of learning structural and positional information adaptively and encoding more informative characteristics in real-world networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSGL outperforms the state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/leaf-ygq/PSGL.

AB Social networking platforms allow users to ask questions, exchange information, opinions, ideas, and promote companies. Social media's massive user-generated text is useful for study, translation, and analysis. Due of their quick spread and detrimental impact, offensive remarks, hate speech, and harassment must be discovered and deleted immediately. In non-English main language environments, code-mixed text makes hate speech detection difficult. Hate speech's thematic emphasis and target-oriented orientation are typically ignored in binary categorization methods. These methods also fail in code-mixing multilingual contexts. In this study, we propose an optimal feature extraction and hybrid diagonal gated recurrent neural network (FE-DGRNN) for hate speech detection and sentiment analysis on code-mixed texts in multiple languages. Our FE-DGRNN technique consists of three processes: preprocessing, improved seagull optimization (ISO) for feature extraction, and hybrid diagonal gated recurrent neural network (Hyb-DGRNN) for hate speech detection and sentiment analysis. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using the HASOC 2019 dataset, focusing on English and German. The results demonstrate high accuracy of 95%, 96%, and 92% for English tasks, with Precision and Fmeasure of 94%, 96%, and 91%. For German tasks, the accuracy is 92% and 93%, with Precision and F-measure of 90% and 91%.

AB Municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration processes often experience fluctuations in the physical and chemical properties of waste materials, leading to unstable combustion and increased flue-gas emissions. This hinders the development of greener waste-treatment methods. Currently, experts rely on their experience in observing flames during field operations to determine the combustion state. However, this process is energy consuming, subjective, and not optimal for controlling MSW incineration (MSWI). To address this issue, this study proposes a dataset of MSWI flame images for identifying combustion states using a vision-transformer-improved deep forest classification (ViT-IDFC) algorithm. The ViT-IDFC algorithm extracts multilayer visual transformation features from flame images based on a pre-trained ViT model's transformer coding layer. The experience of domain experts was used to select the depth features. The algorithm then constructed an IDFC model by combining the selected ViT visual transformation features and the original flame image as inputs for the cascade forest. The proposed method was evaluated using a dataset of flame images, and the results demonstrated accuracies of 98.15% and 96.43% in identifying the left and right grate flame images, respectively, which are acceptable in the industry.

AB This paper solves a bi-level optimization problem in which at the first level, the distribution system operator (DSO) as a retailer tends to extract selling energy price signals so that increases its profit and reduces the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) of the MMG transactive energy; and at the second level energy management problems of non-cooperative networked microgrids (MGs) are solved individually to minimize their cost. This game theoretically problem is known as the Stackelberg game and has been solved with classical optimization methods like Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method previously. To solve this problem with the classical KKT method, the MGs' information should be provided for the DSO as a game starter, which is not the MGs' desire for their privacy concerns. With the aim of preserving the privacy of MGs, this paper has developed a decision-making mechanism based on reinforcement learning (RL) to help the DSO extract energy prices individually for each MG. Also, the deep neural network (DNN) is used as a practical tool to predict MGs' behavior in response to signal price. Furthermore, in the model used in this study, energy storage systems (ESSs) are dedicated to MGs which makes the model non-linear, thus the proposed method unlike the classic method is able to solve such a problem. The results obtained from the comparison between the classic and proposed method show that the implementation of this machine learning-based method is not only accurate enough but also is faster than the classical method, in addition to its privilege of privacy-preserving. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to evaluate the DSO profit and PAR under different weighting factors of the objective function to obtain an appropriate performance.

   Real-time semantic segmentation
AB The wide application of small mobile devices makes the demand for lightweight real-time semantic segmentation algorithm become more and more intense, which makes it become one of the most popular research topics in the field of computer vision. However, some current methods blindly pursue low parameter numbers and high inference speeds, resulting in excessively low model accuracy and a loss of practical value. Therefore, a lightweight multi-scale attention-guided network for real-time semantic segmentation(LMANet) based on asymmetric encoder-decoder is proposed in this paper to solve the above dilemmas. In the encoder, we propose multi-scale asymmetric residual(MAR) modules to extract local spatial information and context information to enhance feature expression. In the decoder, we design an attention feature fusion(AFF) module and an attention pyramid refining (APR) module. AFF module guides the fusion of low-level and middle-level feature information through high-level semantic information, and finally refines the fusion result through APR module. In addition, we improve the segmentation performance of the model with the help of the attention modules in the network. Our network is tested on two complex urban road datasets. The experimental results show that LMANet achieves 70.6% mIoU and 66.5% mIoU on Cityscapes and Camvid datasets at 112FPS and 333FPS respectively, only 0.95 M parameters without any pre-training or pre-processing. Compared with most of existing state-of-the-art models, our network not only guarantees reasonable inference speed and parameter quantity, but also improves the accuracy as much as possible, which makes it more practical.

AB Calibration inductive logics are based on accepting estimates of relative frequencies, which are used to generate imprecise probabilities. In turn, these imprecise probabilities are intended to guide beliefs and decisions - a process called "calibration". Two prominent examples are Henry E. Kyburg's system of Evidential Probability and Jon Williamson's version of Objective Bayesianism. There are many unexplored questions about these logics. How well do they perform in the short-run? Under what circumstances do they do better or worse? What is their performance relative to traditional Bayesianism? In this article, we develop an agent-based model of a classic binomial decision problem, including players based on variations of Evidential Probability and Objective Bayesianism. We compare the performances of these players, including against a benchmark player who uses standard Bayesian inductive logic. We find that the calibrated players can match the performance of the Bayesian player, but only with particular acceptance thresholds and decision rules. Among other points, our discussion raises some challenges for characterising "cautious" reasoning using imprecise probabilities. Thus, we demonstrate a new way of systematically comparing imprecise probability systems, and we conclude that calibration inductive logics are surprisingly promising for making decisions.

ID HISTOGRAM; EQUALIZATION; MODEL
AB Underwater images suffer from color cast and low contrast due to the light absorption and scattering. Especially when natural light is not sufficient, large dark areas appear in the captured image, making it impossible to understand the image content. To address this issue, we propose an underwater low-light enhancement method based on Retinex theory. Our model is an end-to-end trainable. The decomposition network decomposes the raw image into reflectance and illumination according to Retinex theory. In the reflectance enhancement network, cross-residual blocks and dense connections can improve the efficiency of feature utilization and the hybrid attention concentrate on the regions of interest in feature maps from different perspectives. The illumination adjustment network utilizes adaptive frequency convolutional blocks to generate additional band information, which reconstructs the more natural illumination. In order to preserve the color consistency of the enhanced image with the reference image, we project the HSV space into the Cartesian coordinate system and use the Euclidean distance as the color cast loss to constrain the enhancement network. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on different underwater datasets indicate that our method has the excellent performance and can achieve delightful visual enhancements.

AB Unknown data can be forecast by learning the patterns of change from the historical data at regular intervals. However, when samples are not available at a regular interval, the forecasting task becomes very challenging. This paper proposes an improved Gated Recurrent Unit model for non-equal interval time series, abbreviated as NITS-GRU, to model the data of the series without resampling and data imputation. NITS-GRU includes GRU-ODE module, multivariate-based sample correlation calculation module, and information fusion module. The GRU-ODE module generates forecast information of adjacent samples by calculating their hidden layer states, as well as the accumulated difference information between each adjacent sample and forecasting sample over time intervals. Meanwhile, we calculate the correlations between each adjacent sample and forecasting sample based on multiple variables, and adopt attention mechanism to obtain correlation weights of these adjacent samples. The information fusion module applies the correlation weights on forecast information of the adjacent samples generated by the GRU-ODE module, to obtain the final forecast results. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate that NITS-GRU outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines for forecasting unknown data in non-equal interval time series.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; MULTILAYER FEEDFORWARD NETWORKS
AB Due to rapid climate change and man-made activities, the types of leaf diseases are gradually increasing. As a result, taking the essential measures to recognize and diagnose the problem becomes a top priority. Though manual techniques for identifying leaf disease have been used in the past, research-based studies may produce a better result and overcome the disadvantages of the manual process. Nowadays, the random vector functional link (RVFL) network gaining popularity day by day due to the better generalization ability for various applications. In the spirit of the popular twin support vector machine (TSVM) and the twin variant of the random vector functional link (TRVFL) network, a novel twin RVFL (TRVFL1norm) is suggested in this work. TRVFL1norm overcomes the inherent limitation of TRVFL, which loses the sparsity due to the use of 2 norm and also gives a high penalty to outlier points which leads to degrade the generalization performance. Moreover, it is well known that Universum data can be used as prior knowledge in the training model. Therefore, to make the model more robust and generalized, we propose another model, TRVFL1norm based on the Universum data (UTRVFL1norm). UTRVFL1norm possesses the advantages of both 1-norm as well as Universum data. For both TRVFL1norm and UTRVFL1norm, few of the components in the output matrix will be zero due to sparsity hence, the resultant classifier must depend on the lesser output nodes compared to TRVFL. To verify model's performance, we have compared the classification performance of proposed TRVFL1norm and UTRVFL1norm models with support vector machine (SVM), Universum SVM (USVM), twin support vector machine (TSVM), Universum TSVM (UTSVM), random vector functional link (RVFL), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) on few interesting benchmark datasets. Further, we have also checked the performance of TRVFL1norm and UTRVFL1norm for leaf disease detection as one of the possible applications. The experimental results indicate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed models.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Engineering management plays a significant part in project construction, and it is a process involved with making decision under uncertainty. When decision makers are hesitant to assess investment projects, fuzzy set theory offers an effective tool for dealing with uncertainty. In this paper, a decision-making method is put forward for handling engineering management problems, where dual hesitant fuzzy set is adopted to model the uncertainty. Firstly, we raise an improved dual hesitant fuzzy correlation coefficient and its weighted form. Compared with the current dual hesitant fuzzy correlation coefficients, the presented one has more desirable properties. It not only can manifest the positive or negative correlation between dual hesitant fuzzy sets, but also can guarantee the dual hesitant fuzzy correlation coefficient is 1 (-1) if and only if the two dual hesitant fuzzy sets are identical (complementary). Secondly, a mathematical programming model, which integrates within-attribute and between-attribute variation information, is designed to derive the attribute weights. More importantly, it can fully utilize the decision information. Finally, the weighted correlation coefficients are calculated, and an illustrative example concerning engineering management is offered to demonstrate the rationality of the proposed technique.

AB Domain adaptation (DA) approaches have been extensively applied to the diagnosis of rotating machinery faults under different working conditions. However, most DA-based methods perform poorly in practical situations since they generally only consider the global distribution or subdomain distribution of the source and target domains. Thus, we propose a novel Deep Convolution Multi-Adversarial adaptation network with Correlation Alignment (DCMACA). DCMACA consists of an improved deep convolutional feature extractor, a domain adaptation module, and a label classifier. The improved deep convolutional feature extractor comprises ordinary convolutional layers, depthwise convolution layers, Squeeze and Excitation modules, skip connection operations, an average pooling layer, and a fully connected layer. The domain adaptation module introduces multiple domain discriminators and Coral distance to align the subdomain distribution and global distribution of features extracted by the feature extractor, respectively. The softmax function is employed as the label classifier. Based on DCMACA, we presented a new approach for identifying faults in rotating machinery under different operating conditions. First, the original vibration signals are converted into the time-frequency maps of size 64 x 64 via the continuous wavelet transform and bilinear interpolation technologies. Subsequently, the time-frequency maps are input to DCMACA to complete the extraction of transferable features and fault identification. The proposed DCMACA fault identification approach was evaluated through two experiments, where it achieved an average accuracy of 98.84% in 18 migration diagnostic tasks. The comprehensive results reveal that the presented approach can realize higher diagnostic accuracies, robustness, and superior generalization capability compared to the existing mainstream DA approaches.

AB Most of the problems associated with physical, biological and engineering systems are complex and are usually modeled with the help of linear as well as non-linear differential equations. In general, the exact solutions of non-linear differential equations may not be obtained by analytical methods and thus, in this paper, a numerical method is proposed to find approximate solutions of differential equations using Chebyshev polynomials and metaheuristic optimization algorithms. In this paper, Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are modeled as optimization problems to determine their approximate solutions by considering Chebyshev polynomials as the base approximation function, taking initial and/or boundary conditions as constraints. The unknown coefficients of the polynomials are calculated using Differential Evolution (DE) in order to get the approximate solution with minimal error. The proposed method is applied to find the approximate solution to both Initial and Boundary Value Problems. For all test problems considered in this paper, the algorithms have been programmed using MATLAB software to run on computer. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by graphical comparison of the computed approximate solutions with that of the exact ones. Further, the performance of the method proposed in this paper is shown by finding out the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the exact and approximate solution, which is found to be better than that of the related existing papers.

AB The addition of increasing numbers of new energy sources can lead to challenges to the security and stability of power systems. The combined rotor angle stability (RAS) framework of power systems with multiple time-scales could lead to uncoordinated stability control commands for numerous stability control devices of power systems. To mitigate this deficiency, this study proposes a unified RAS framework to replace the RAS with three timescales, which consist of small-disturbance, large-disturbance, and long-term RASs. This study proposes lazy deep Q networks for the unified RAS framework of power systems. The lazy deep Q networks approach, which is based on the Markov decision process, contains lazy learning, deep Q networks, a state-buffer, a selector operation, and a limiter operation. The unified stability framework and the conventional combined stability framework of power systems are compared under four cases, i.e., the power system with four generators, the power system based on IEEE 39-bus system, the European high voltage 89-bus system, and the European high voltage 1354-bus system. These four case studies verify that the unified stability framework based on the lazy deep Q networks approach is more stable than the conventional combined stability framework based on the combination of optimization algorithm of long-term dynamic stability, control method of middle-term transient stability, and control method of short-term static stability. The error indices for the proposed lazy deep Q networks algorithm are as follows: the AAE is at least 4.7% lower than the other compared algorithms; the IAE is at least 4.8% lower than the other compared algorithms; the ISE is at least 3.9% lower than the other compared algorithms; the ITAE is 2.3% lower than the other compared algorithms.

AB The aggregation of multiple rankings into a consensus ranking is a crucial task in various domains such as search engine results or user-based ratings. This task poses significant challenges due to its inherent complexity. The complexity of the problem stems not only from the need for exactness and efficiency, but also from the diversity of real-world scenarios, which often involve incomplete rankings and ties. Most existing methods propose a specific way to aggregate rankings. However, these methods often do not take into account different real use-case scenarios which can impact the relevance of their final result, as the congruence between the aggregated output and the expected outcome inherently depends on the context. To address the issue of context-dependency in ranking aggregation, we introduce a unifying framework that subsumes a variety of generalizations of the Kemeny score for incomplete rankings with ties and enables the design of new ones if a specific context requires it. Our framework is parameterized, allowing for different behaviors depending on the specific use case. We provide a broader scope of application to the methods encompassed by our approach, augmenting them with a larger theoretical and algorithmic structure. We establish an axiomatic study to better understand each method within our framework and present an algorithmic approach that includes exact methods, partitioning algorithms, and heuristics. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of our approach through an empirical study on both real and synthetic datasets. Notably, the synthetic datasets are generated based on devised real-world scenarios, highlighting the context-dependent applicability of different Kemeny-based rank aggregation methods within our framework.

ID POLAR FACTORIZATION
AB We apply Lott-Sturm-Villani notion of Ricci curvature as well as McCann-Brenier theorem on optimal transport investigating mean-field variational inference (MFVI). In the continuous case where the probability rules are defined on Riemannian manifolds we obtain sufficient conditions for convexity of the corresponding variational problem. It can be shown that in the presence of symmetry the convexity can provide the preservation of mode. We then consider factorization into a mixed continuous-discrete case. By rescaling the Riemannian structure of the continuous component we have derived sufficient conditions under which the convexity of Kullback-Leibler functional is established. We apply the latter theorem to Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and we introduce a new class of these models which have the advantage of being convex. It is shown that the MAP for the corrected GMM remains a consistent estimator. Additionally thanks to convexity we are able to prove the mode of MFVI for the new model in asymptotic regimes converges to the right solution. We do not know any other rigorous result for MFVI in statistical learning.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional computing architecture (Von Neumann) that requires data transfer between the off-chip memory and processor consumes a large amount of energy when running machine learning (ML) models. Memristive synaptic devices are employed to eliminate this inevitable inefficiency in energy while solving cognitive tasks. However, the performances of energy-efficient neuromorphic systems, which are expected to provide promising results, need to be enhanced in terms of accuracy and test error rates for classification applications. Improving accuracy in such ML models depends on the optimal learning parameter changes from a device to algorithm-level optimisation. To do this, this paper considers the Adadelta, an adaptive learning rate technique, to achieve accurate results by reducing the losses and compares the accuracy, test error rates, and energy consumption of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad and Adadelta optimisation methods integrated into the Ag:a-Si synaptic device neural network model. The experimental results demonstrated that Adadelta enhanced the accuracy of the hardware-based neural network model by up to 4.32% when compared to the Adagrad method. The Adadelta method achieved the best accuracy rate of 94%, while DGD and SGD provided an accuracy rate of 68.11 and 75.37%, respectively. These results show that it is vital to select a proper optimisation method to enhance performance, particularly the accuracy and test error rates of the neuro-inspired nano-synaptic device-based neural network models.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has been a global public health concern since March 11, 2020. Healthcare systems struggled to meet patients' growing needs for diagnosis, treatment, and care. As healthcare industries struggled to cope with the overwhelming demands, advanced intelligence and computing technologies have become essential. Artificial intelligence techniques have become essential for identifying and triaging patients, predicting disease severity, and detecting outcomes. The aim of the paper is to propose a gradient boosting-based model to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients and to improve the prediction accuracy by incorporating resampling strategies. A real COVID-19 data that includes patients' travel, health, geographical, and demographic information is obtained from a public repository. The dataset used in the study has the class imbalance problem, and several approaches are applied to solve the problem. In this study, a gradient boosting-based model for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients is proposed. This approach incorporates resampling strategies, such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), random under-sampling, and clustering-based under-sampling, to address the imbalanced class distribution problem in the dataset. Then, gradient boosting machines (GBM) such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost) are analyzed in terms of accuracy and computational time. Random search method is used to find the optimal hyper-parameters for the algorithms. A stacking-based hybrid model that combines the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms was used for comparison in the experiments. In the experiments, the factors that can influence the mortality of COVID-19 patients are investigated. And, it is found that the age of the patient, whether the patient belonged to Wuhan, the difference between when they first noticed symptoms and when they visited the hospital (in days) affect the mortality. By utilizing over/under-sampling approaches, we ameliorated the concern of class imbalance. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are effectively analyzed in terms of various performance metrics to determine the suitable GBM for the proposed system. The experimental results revealed that the stacking-based hybrid model performs well with the balanced dataset provided by SMOTE. CatBoost produces superior results for a balanced dataset with random under-sampling and clustering-based under-sampling. The main focus of the study is to propose a gradient boosting-based model for predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients. This study also emphasizes the importance of addressing the imbalanced class distribution problem in the dataset and incorporates resampling strategies to improve the prediction accuracy. Our promising result confirms the success of the proposed system in predicting mortality of COVID-19 disease.

AB Link prediction in dynamic(temporal) networks refers to predicting future edges by analyzing the available network information. Among the existing temporal link prediction approaches, non-negative matrix factorization(NMF) is a kind of competitive algorithm and has attracted extensive attention. However, traditional NMF-based prediction methods are shallow methods and cannot fully mine the dynamic network, which may lead to a decrease in performance of algorithms. To overcome these shortcomings, inspired by deep Autoencoder, we propose two novel deep Autoencoder-like NMF with graph regularized prediction methods for dynamic networks. By fusing encoder component with deep structure into deep NMF model, our algorithms can sufficiently exploit the complex hierarchical information hidden in dynamic networks. To further extract the abundant information hidden in dynamic networks, graph regularization and PageRank are utilized to exploit the local and global topology information of each snapshot, respectively. By jointly optimizing them in deep Autoencoder-like NMF model, our model is able to preserve the local and global information hidden in dynamic networks, simultaneously. Moreover, an effective alternating iterative method with convergence guarantee is developed for minimizing the established model. Finally, we test our proposed prediction methods on several synthetic and real world datasets to demonstrate that our approaches outperform the state-of-the-art prediction approaches.

AB The paper proposes a method to simplify a rule base of zero order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy classifier, involving the determination of the epsilon-similar rules based on fuzzy clustering with epsilon-hyperballs. The rule simplification process is based on the concept of epsilon-insensitivity areas underlying the partitioning process of rule centers (centers of membership functions in the rule premises), which directly corresponds to the idea of rule epsilon-similarity. Clustering parameters leading to the best performance of the modified rule base, including the degree of rule epsilon-similarity, are determined by means of the evolution strategy. Since our main objective was to maintain the high performance of the resulting classifier, two rule-based simplification procedures, both called rule base refinement, are proposed. The work focuses mainly on the practical application to support the diagnosis of fetal condition based on the analysis of CardioTocoGraphic (CTG) signals. The publicly available collection of CTG recordings (CTU-UHB) was used in order to verify the quality of the introduced solutions. The classification performance was assessed with respect to the reference evaluation of fetal state determined on the basis of a retrospective analysis using the newborn outcome defined with different thresholds of the blood pH from the umbilical artery. The experiments confirmed the high generalization ability of the refined fuzzy classifier, in particular its high efficiency in supporting the qualitative assessment of fetal condition based on the analysis of parameters quantitatively describing fetal signals.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Feature selections facilitate classification learning in various data environments. Aiming at interval-valued decision systems (IVDSs), feature selections rely on information measures and similarity degrees, whereas current selection algorithms on credibility-based condition entropy and classical similarity degree are accompanied with some measurement limitations and advancement space. In this paper based on IVDSs, three coverage-credibility-based condition entropies and one geometry-probabilistic similarity degree are proposed across two dimensions of informationization and granulation, and they improve the existing condition entropy and similarity degree; accordingly, 4 x 2 feature selections emerge for optimization and applicability, and they systematically contain one initial selection algorithm and seven new/robuster algorithms. At first, three-way granular measures (i.e., credibility, coverage, and integrated coverage-credibility) are formulated in IVDSs, and three novel condition entropies are established by implementing three information structures on coverage-credibility. These condition entropies acquire in-depth improvements, hierarchical algorithms, size relationships, maximum/minimum conditions, and granulation non-monotonicity. Then, the probabilistic similarity degree is defined by a six-piecewise function with quadratic factors, and this new measure gains the geometry-probability mechanism and high-quality improvement. Furthermore, feature selections are determined by preserving condition entropies and by mining feature significances, so eight selection algorithms are obtained by combining condition entropies and similarity degrees. Finally, data experiments are performed to validate relevant uncertainty measures and feature selections, and seven constructional selection algorithms outperform three contrastive algorithms to achieve better classification performances.

AB Along with unstable mechanical status, the critical uncertainty of micro-transformer at electronic specification boundary leads to potentially defective products (PDPs) in qualified products. Hence, an intelligent prediction of PDPs is proposed by integrating mechanical and electronic signals and tracing defective product information. The objective is to screen out the PDPs by the relationship between critical state of normal test equipment and the defective ex-factory products in actual production. On the base of time and frequency domain eigenvalues, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Naive Bayes (NB) were firstly employed to process the vibration signal of equipment testing probe for network training and prior probability, respectively. Then, the various electronic signals related to quality performance parameters were categorized to screen out the PDPs by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) along with spatial distance and hyperplane databases, respectively. Finally, the screen-out threshold was introduced to evaluate the reasonableness with reference to the phase-out divergence. It is shown that the NB more precisely recognizes the equipment status by timely updating small and incomplete samples than the ANN. Compared to the SVM, the KNN validly screens out the PDPs due to its superior processing capability of electronic signals. As a result, the screen-out threshold is set as 5-6% to balance the screen-out number and precision.

AB In recent decades, research on supply chain management (SCM) has enabled companies to improve their environmental, social, and economic performance.This paper presents an industrial application of logistics that can be classified as an inventory-route problem. The problem consists of assigning orders to the available warehouses. The orders are composed of items that must be loaded within a week. The warehouses provide an inventory of the number of items available for each day of the week, so the objective is to minimize the total transportation costs and the costs of producing extra stock to satisfy the weekly demand. To solve this problem a formal mathematical model is proposed. Then a hybrid approach that involves two metaheuristics: a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) and a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. Additionally, a meta-learning tuning method is incorporated into our hybridized approach, which yields better results but with a longer computation time. Thus, the trade-off of using it is analyzed.An extensive evaluation was carried out over realistic instances provided by an industrial partner. The proposed technique was evaluated and compared with several complete and incomplete solvers from the state of the art (CP Optimizer, Yuck, OR-Tools, etc.). The results showed that our hybrid metaheuristic outperformed the behavior of these well-known solvers, mainly in large-scale instances (2000 orders per week). This hybrid algorithm provides the company with a powerful tool to solve its supply chain management problem, delivering significant economic benefits every week.

DE Video classification; Few-shot learning; Hierarchy graph neural network
AB Few-shot video classification methods aim to recognize a new class with only a few training examples. Distinct from previous few-shot methods, we explicitly consider the relations in cross-video domains and take full advantage of the cross-video frame matching in a hierarchy learning fashion. In this paper, we propose a DualHierarchy Graph Neural Network to realize comprehensive cross-video frame matching and video relation modeling. In the first hierarchy of the graph neural network, we build a Cross-video Frame Matching Graph to extract robust frame-level features via accumulating information across frames sampled from both query and support videos. Then, frame representations are accumulated to obtain the video-level features. In the second hierarchy of the graph neural network, we construct a Video Relation Graph by taking the video-level features as nodes, which can adaptively learn positive relations between query and support videos. We get the predicted label of the query video through the matching learning of edges connecting video nodes. We evaluate the model on three benchmarks: HMDB51, Kinetics, and UCF101. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model significantly improves few-shot video classification across a wide range of competitive baselines and showcases the strong generalization of our framework. The source code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/JiaMingZhong2621/DHGNN.

AB Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) uses models trained from source domains to solve similar tasks in unlabeled domains, without accessing source domain data. Existing SFDA methods have not been able to learn spatial and semantic structural information of target domains simultaneously, making them insufficient and inefficient for target domain exploration. To fully explore the target domain structural information, we propose a novel representation learning framework, called structural information enhancement (SIE). SIE has a two-stage approach that, in the first stage, clusters local neighbors and pushes away global non-neighbors in the feature space to obtain spatial structural information. In the second stage, SIE fine-tunes the clustered model using a semantic structure consistency strategy that exploits semantic structural information by mutual learning interpolated sample pairs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, and our method can serve as a strong baseline for future SFDA research.

AB As environmental concerns and social legislation continue to gain importance, supply chain decision-makers are increasingly required to consider economic and ecological objectives. A potential strategy for mitigating sustainability issues entails the utilisation of discarded tyres through the process of recycling. Nevertheless, the establishment of a closed-loop supply chain that is both sustainable and profitable presents a noteworthy challenge. This study proposes a novel multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model to design a sustainable closed-loop supply chain network in the tire industry. The objective of the model is to optimize the overall cost of the network, taking into account the environmental consequences related to the establishment of facilities, tire processing, and transportation. While metaheuristic algorithms have been extensively employed to solve network design problems, they are not very effective in handling large-scale networks. To overcome this limitation, our study introduces six new multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition (MOEA/D) variants. The present study introduces a prospective methodology for devising supply chain networks that are sustainable in nature, while simultaneously ensuring a harmonious equilibrium between economic and environmental considerations. The efficacy of the proposed multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model and its MOEA/D variants in addressing large-scale networks has been demonstrated through the obtained results. As such, this study contributes to sustainable supply chain management, which is becoming increasingly important in the current environment.

AB Graph convolutional network has been extensively employed in semi-supervised classification tasks. Although some studies have attempted to leverage graph convolutional networks to explore multi-view data, they mostly consider the fusion of feature and topology individually, leading to the underutilization of the consistency and complementarity of multi-view data. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end joint fusion framework that aims to simultaneously conduct a consistent feature integration and an adaptive topology adjustment. Specifically, to capture the feature consistency, we construct a deep matrix decomposition module, which maps data from different views onto a feature space obtaining a consistent feature representation. Moreover, we design a more flexible graph convolution that allows to adaptively learn a more robust topology. A dynamic topology can greatly reduce the influence of unreliable information, which acquires a more adaptive representation. As a result, our method jointly designs an effective feature fusion module and a topology adjustment module, and lets these two modules mutually enhance each other. It takes full advantage of the consistency and complementarity to better capture the more intrinsic information. The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification methods.

AB Optically transparent and structurally flexible metamaterial absorbers (MMAs) are widely used in many practical applications. However, the realization of such MMAs requires both thickness reduction and bandwidth enhancement, which remains a challenge task. As a multi-objective optimization problem, it is a time-consuming and resource-demanding process. Guided by prior-knowledge, two degrees of freedom are taken into account in the design, namely the structure of unit-cells and their spatial arrangement. In this way, the multi-objective optimization problem is simplified into a two-step problem. A general procedure based on machine-learning (ML) method is proposed to solve this problem. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to map the configuration parameters of a type of meta-atom onto its reflection coefficients; then, a dynamic graph convolutional neural network (DGCNN) is trained to realize the synthesis of quasi-periodic distributed MMA array; finally, combined with the differential evolution (DE) algorithm, the optimized configuration of the meta-atoms and their optimum distribution are obtained. Based on the proposed procedure, an ultrathin optically transparent and flexible MMA is designed, fabricated and further verified by experiments. The designed MMA realizes 87% absorption bandwidth covering 6.22 GHz-19.42 GHz (103% relative bandwidth) with the thickness only 3.3 mm (0.068 lambda(L)), which approaches the theoretical limit (1/17 lambda(L)). And its averaged transparency is about 63% at the wavelength range 500-800 mm. The whole design process is achieved 50 times faster than the conventional full-wave simulation, which convincingly demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.

AB The identification of maintenance significant items (MSIs), which is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process, is the primary phase of reliability centered maintenance. The identification process is typically vague and uncertain as a result of the structural complexity and functional diversity of machine tools. Therefore, there are limited effective methods for identifying MSIs in machine tools. In this study, we propose a novel MSI identification method that integrates two MCDM methods, namely the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC). A novel extension of the fuzzy theory called the spherical fuzzy (SF) set concept is combined with the integrated DEMATELMABAC method. SF-DEMATEL is used to evaluate the criteria weights of machine tools. Then, based on the judgement information regarding alternatives under each criterion, SF-MABAC is used to identify and rank MSIs. The proposed integration method was applied to a CNC lathe with six criteria and 11 alternatives. Robustness analysis was conducted to verify the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the integration of DEMATEL and MABAC under the SF concept is a reasonable and applicable method for MSI identification. The results support engineers into reasonably identifying the significant maintenance items for machine tools.

AB Clot formation in the left atrial appendage (LAA) poses a high risk of ischemic strokes and systemic embolism to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common type of sustained heart arrhythmia that affects more than 35 million people worldwide. Hemodynamic metrics evaluated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) have been employed to assess the risk of thrombosis in LAA, but its utilization in clinical settings is limited due to their cumbersome operations and high computational cost. To this end, we propose UDGCNN (U: U-net, DGCNN: Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network) that can utilize data from the point cloud of patient-specific LAA geometries as inputs and predict multiple hemodynamic indexes for systematic assessment of the thrombotic risk. The novelty of the proposed model lies in introducing edge convolution layers to the PointNet structure to improve the model's capacity to learn local features, which is essential for training and predicting complex patient-specific geometries. Moreover, the network structure of UDGCNN is optimized by integrating the Encoder-Decoder structure and skip-connection to extract hierarchical features from the point cloud. The accuracy and efficiency of the UDGCNN is examined by training and testing on 371 LAA geometries from patients with AF, the largest patient-specific dataset in the literature. Using mean absolute error and model inference time as metrics, we demonstrate that UDGCNN can provide an assessment of multiple hemodynamic metrics in 3D patient-specific geometries with prediction error similar to 30% lower than those of the state-of-art PointNet model, whereas the inference time is 500-fold shorter compared to computational time CFD simulation. It is noted that UDGCNN is a general computational framework that can be extended to study various cardiovascular diseases. In summary, this study presents a new computational tool that enables end -to-end stratification of thrombotic risk in LAA based on bioimaging, thereby advancing the current screening approach in clinical practice.

AB Drastic advancement in computing technology and the dramatic increase in the usage of explainable machine learning algorithms provide a promising platform for developing robust intrusion detection algorithms. However, the development of these algorithms is constrained by their applicability over specific scenarios of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). We introduced a hybrid framework by combining Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (P2CA) and Generalised Additive Model (GAM), which is performing well for all the scenarios of WSNs. To demonstrate our framework's broad applicability, we evaluated its performance over three publicly available intrusion detection datasets (i.e., LT-FS-ID, AutoML-ID, and FF-ANN-ID), each from different scenarios. Our findings highlight that the presented framework can accurately predict the number of k-barriers for all three datasets. Furthermore, we conducted a comprehensive performance comparison between our proposed framework and benchmark algorithms, which revealed that our approach outperforms all of them. Additionally, we evaluated the framework's versatility by testing its performance on datasets unrelated to intrusion detection, specifically ALE datasets. Notably, our approach accurately predicted the response variable in these datasets and exceeded the performance of its primary algorithm, further demonstrating its robustness and adaptability. The implications of this research are substantial. By developing a robust intrusion detection framework that performs well across diverse WSN scenarios, we address a critical need for reliable network security in various domains, including industrial IoT, smart cities, and environmental monitoring. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of intrusion detection in WSNs but also pave the way for developing more sophisticated and adaptable systems to safeguard sensitive data and critical infrastructure.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Job recommendation is crucial in online recruitment platforms due to the overwhelming number of job postings. Job seekers spend considerable time and effort searching for suitable employment. With millions of job seekers browsing job postings daily, the demand for accurate and effective job recommendations is more pressing than ever. To address this challenge, we propose IHGCN, an improved semi-supervised heterogeneous graph convolutional network model for job recommendation. IHGCN aims to provide job recommendations for early job seekers based on their resumes. Firstly, we introduce a novel labeling classification standard specifically tailored to early job seeker resumes. Secondly, we construct a heterogeneous resume graph where each resume is represented as a node. Job recommendation is treated as a multi-classification problem. Thirdly, our IHGCN model learns a node representation from the graph to perform effective job recommendations. To evaluate our model, we conduct experiments using a real-world resume dataset obtained from LinkedIn. The results demonstrate that IHGCN outperforms the baselines by around 10%. This study highlights the benefits of leveraging meta-paths within the Graph Convolutional Network model to address the sparsity problem caused by the one-hot representation of nodes.

AB This paper studies effective traceable feature representation learning in the view of distribution transformation, termed FeatsFlow, by proposing a distribution-aware learning framework combining the discriminating model with a normalizing flow-based model. The process can be regarded as a series of feature distribution transformations, from the input images to the expected results. Focusing on the learned representation of the target model, we take full advantage of the invertible nature of normalizing flows and learn the practical and traceable feature representation for target goals. Considering that it is difficult to model the traceable process for feature extraction, we propose an effective model by combining a general discriminating model with normalizing flows for traceable feature extraction. The normalizing flows module is added to the original model in a plug-in mode, which is convenient to make it available for effective and traceable feature learning. Thus we can obtain an effective and traceable representation distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed representation learning model for the image classification task, and the experimental results illustrate that our proposed model is adequate for traceable representation learning. The most important is that we present a distribution-aware representation learning approach, which makes it possible to conduct and understand feature representation learning at the feature level.

AB Twin support vector machine (TSVM) is a practical machine learning algorithm, whereas traditional TSVM can be limited for data with outliers or noises. To address this problem, we propose a novel TSVM with the symmetric LINEX loss function (SLTSVM) for robust classification. There are several advantages of our method: (1) The performance of the proposed SLTSVM for data with outliers or noise can be improved by using the symmetric LINEX loss function. (2) The introduction of regularization term can effectively improve the generalization ability of our model. (3) An efficient iterative algorithm is developed to solve the optimization problems of our SLTSVM. (4) The convergence and time complexity of the iterative algorithm are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, our model does not involve loss function parameter, which makes our method more competitive. Experimental results on synthetic, benchmark and image datasets with label noises and feature noises demonstrate that our proposed method slightly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on most datasets.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes an innovative approach for mitigating the effects of deception attacks in Markov jumping systems by developing an adaptive neural network control strategy. To address the challenge of dual-mode monitoring mechanisms, two independent Markov chains are used to describe the state changes of the system and the intermittent actuator. By employing a mapping technique, these individual chains are amalgamated into a unified joint Markov chain. Additionally, to effectively approximate the unbounded false signals injected by deception attacks, an adaptive neural network technique is skillfully built. A mode monitoring scheme is implemented to design an asynchronous control law that links the mode information between the joint Markov chain and controller with fewer modes. The paper derives sufficient criteria for the mean-square bounded stability of the resulting system based on Lyapunov theories. Finally, a numerical experiment is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In the arena of digital image processing, mixed noise is normally depicted. Nevertheless, the main limitation of the existing noise removal methods is the exploitation of the statistics of the original contaminated image. Concerns such as high computational complexity, halo artifacts and over-saturation issue are presented in the edges of the noisy images i.e. high-frequency components of the mixed noise digital images which lead to false guesstimate of noisy patches that negatively results on the task of recovery processes of the restoration images. This paper proposes a rapid and high accurate mixed noise removal method by combining pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) and regularization of Perona-Malik equation (P-M equation) in order to remove unwanted contamination. In this regard, the locations of impulse noise are positioned using PCNN, the second-generation wavelet filter is used to suppress the mixed noise into small local neighborhood, and then the full noisy image is denoised by exploiting the regularization of P-M equation. The fine details and sharp edges are well preserved in the proposed method. In addition, subjective and objective analyses are showed that the visual quality of the proposed mixed noise removal technique outperformed state of the art noise removal methods. Extensive results show that the proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art mixed noise removal techniques, with PSNR improvements of (0.85 dB to 1.54 dB) and SSIM improvements range of (0.0132-0.1521). Moreover, improvements in running time of the proposed technique was the second best technique with improvements range of (0.33-0.56 s) on wide range of benchmark digital images.

AB Software defect prediction contributes to ensuring the quality of software development and reducing software maintenance costs. However, the class imbalance problem can affect the accuracy of defect prediction classification, which is a crucial issue to be solved urgently. We propose a novel software defect prediction model based on a twin support vector machine to address imbalanced data classification issues and optimize the prediction effect. The model embeds the within-class structure of the training samples as the regularization term into the objective function, considering the structural information hidden in the data, and obtains the class structure information through clustering. Moreover, by introducing within-class structure information to maximize the within-class distances and one class intervals, the model produces a superior classification hyperplane and enhances the generalization ability of the support vector machine. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves higher prediction accuracy, more robust adaptability, and optimized performance in classifying imbalanced data compared with existing algorithms.

AB In recent years, the importance of cognitive intervention promoting physical health and well-being among college students has gained significant attention. The cognitive dimension is pivotal in determining individuals' behaviors and decisions, especially in domains where personal choices significantly impact well-being. However, with increasing awareness concerning the advantages of exercise and healthy behaviors, many college students require assistance prioritizing their physical health because of various problems, including current academic schedules and the stress of postgraduate college admissions. To address these issues, this study presented data mining algorithms to assess the efficacy of cognitive treatments in improving college students' health and fitness through sports activity. It smoothly integrates sports education into a larger social development framework, emphasizing the vital significance of holistic well-being and the numerous benefits of rigorous fitness and physical training regimens. It analyzes the efficacy of college students' sports learning using data mining to clarify the Apriori and decision tree algorithms. It addresses students' sports perceptions, cognitive interventions for sports health and health standards in college physical education. This paper evaluates the intervention's success based on sports value cognition, sports need cognition and sports attitude recognition to improve student performance. The analysis of undergraduate students' post-intervention scores revealed a considerable rise in these areas, with the experimental group scoring 14.2 and the control group scoring 11.53. The specific scores for sports value cognition were 17.86 and 15.7, while those for sports attitudes and cognition were 11.28 and 9.56, respectively. The impact of the cognitive intervention is further analyzed concerning body shape and physical fitness. The results reveal that a higher proportion of students in the intervention group engaged in physical exercise than the control group, especially with more than three weekly exercise sessions. The intervention and control groups' participation rates were 20.2% and 6.75%, respectively. Notably, the intervention group demonstrated a higher proportion (5.78%) of students engaging in five or more physical exercises per week than the control group (1.95%).

AB Many highways are acquiring smart transportation systems to improve traffic efficiency, safety and management. Intelligent transportation systems can monitor traffic congestion by providing estimated time of arrival or suggesting a diversion route. However, due to the chaotic complexity of the highway traffic road network and the short-term mobility of the population, traffic flow prediction is affected by many complex factors, and the development of an effective traffic flow forecasting system is very challenging. This paper establishes a novel framework to enhance the prediction of highway traffic flow based on the integration of Complementary Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition and Gaussian Mixture Model (CEEMD-GMM). Firstly, the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition is used to decompose and reduce the noise of traffic flow data. The empirical modal components are combined by calculating the sample entropy (SE), which makes the time series stable and reduces the time cost of forecasting. Secondly, the histogram of oriented gradient (HoG) is computed to extract the distinct features of various traffic flows and enhance the traffic flow prediction. Furthermore, the highway traffic data is classified using Gaussian mixture model to realize the feature extraction of different types of highway traffics. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percent error (MAPE), and average correlation. The model is extensively verified using traffic flow data under individual weather conditions and different traffic flow datasets. Compared with the traditional support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and Adaboost algorithms, the proposed model shows 2.90% MAE, 6.07% RMSE, 0.38% MAPE and average correlation coefficient of 0.74 for traffic flow detection. It is concluded that the model can predict the highways traffic flow with high accuracy as compared to other contemporary models.

AB Commercial transactions in the metaverse have become more popular in recent years. Sustainable investments are a prerequisite to metaverse survival and growth. There are various factors that have an impact on the performance of sustainable business investments, such as financial analysis and organizational effectiveness. However, each of these improvements leads to increased investment and costs. These new investments may create a heavy financial burden on businesses. In this context, there is a great need to conduct a priority analysis of the criteria affecting these investments in the metaverse. This study uses a balanced scorecard to analyze the alternatives of sustainable business investments in the metaverse. For this purpose, a hybrid quantum spherical fuzzy decision-making approach is proposed by using the facial action coding system and collaborative filtering to measure the weights of the balanced scorecard perspectives with the extended decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and to rank the alternatives of sustainable business investments within the metaverse with the extended technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The analysis perspectives are finance, customers, internal process, learning, and growth. The alternatives are determined as real estate, commerce, tourism, education, and community development for sustainable virtual investment decisions in the metaverse. The novelty of this study is to construct a new decision-making approach based on facial expressions, expert recommendation systems, and the quantum spherical fuzzy sets, as well as a new concept of sustainable business investments within the metaverse. It has been determined that the organizational effectiveness of the enterprises is very important in realizing sustainability goals and increasing sustainability performance. Similarly, tourism is the most suitable sustainable virtual investment area in the Metaverse universe. Using resources to ensure organizational effectiveness helps businesses reduce energy, water, and raw material consumption. This situation contributes to achieving sustainability targets as it allows the consumption of fewer natural resources. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) is a swarm-based optimization technique which takes its inspiration from the butterflies' foraging activity. BOA has gained extensive popularity among the research community and is now utilized to tackle a variety of optimization challenges. However, literatures suggest that its exploration and exploitation are not properly balanced. To overcome this problem, BOA is fused with the crossover of Exchange Market Algorithm (EMA) and with non-uniform mutation. In this paper, enhanced BOA (EBOA) is used for solving the Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch (ORPD) problems. ORPD is traditionally a power system optimization tool that regulates control variables such as Generator bus Voltage, tap settings of tap-changing transformers, and VAR output of compensating devices in order to reduce real power loss, improve voltage deviation, and increase voltage stability. The suggested technique is evaluated using the IEEE 30 bus standard test system, IEEE 118 bus standard test system and Indian 62 bus system. To determine the efficacy of the algorithm, the findings from BOA and EBOA are compared to those produced by other researchers and published in the literature. From the results it can be observed that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce the active power loss by 22%, voltage deviation by 91.6% and L-Index by 42.02 % from their corresponding initial value for IEEE 30 bus system. Similar results can be seen from other test system also. The proposed algorithm is also tested in solving benchmark problems. The simulated results confirm the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm for solving ORPD problems.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The understanding of how genotypes relate to phenotypes is crucial for unravelling the mechanisms of evolution. A fundamental aspect of this relationship lies in the genotype-phenotype mapping, which provides insights into the changes observed in phenotypes corresponding to alterations in genotypes. From a mathematical perspective, the concept of continuity proves invaluable in comprehending such transformations. However, the presence of uncertainty necessitates the utilization of the fuzzy concept as an ideal tool to discuss these changes effectively. Specifically, when considering RNA sequences and their mutations, the genotype space exhibits a topological structure in a fuzzy setting. As a result, the phenotype space, comprised of RNA shapes, can also be endowed with a fuzzy topological structure. This paper explores the fuzzy accessibility of RNA shapes, which enables fuzzy continuous genotype- phenotype mapping. By employing fuzzy techniques, we aim to enhance our understanding of the intricate relationship between genotypes-phenotypes mapping.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Weight prediction and recognition of subject term in documents is widely used in application fields such as literature recommendation and keyword retrieval. Unlike traditional methods which only focus on searching for subject terms from existing keywords in documents, this paper proposes a recognition method of latent subject term outside documents based on a one-class collaborative filtering algorithm that fuses explicit and implicit information. A matrix factorization model based on the analysis of document activity and subject term popularity is constructed to measure the correlation probability between documents and subject terms that do not appear in the current document. After these subject terms being divided into Latent Subject Terms (LST) and Irrelevant Subject Terms (IST), two methods for predicting the weight of these types of subject terms is introduced, which include Hybrid Filling with Preference Coefficients (HFPC), and Zero Filling. In order to verify the effectiveness of subject term recognition, many collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms are conducted with the filled document keyword matrix. On the basis of not changing these algorithms, MAE and FCP can be improved by 28.01% and 22.79% at most, while P@N and NDCG@N can be improved by 22.37% and 27.06%, respectively.

AB Curse of dimensionality is known as big challenges in data mining, pattern recognition, computer vison and machine learning in recent years. Feature selection and feature extraction are two main approaches to circumvent this challenge. The main objective in feature selection is to remove the redundant features and preserve the relevant features in order to improve the learning algorithm performance. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of state-of-art feature selection techniques including mathematical formulas and fundamental algorithm to facilitate understanding. This survey encompasses different approaches of feature selection which can be categorized to five domains including: A) subspace learning which involves matrix factorization and matrix projection, B) sparse representation learning which includes compressed sensing and dictionary learning, C) information theory which covers multi-label neighborhood entropy, symmetrical un-certainty, Monte Carlo and Markov blanket, D) evolutionary computational algorithms including Genetic algo-rithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), Ant colony (AC) and Grey wolf optimization (GWO), and E) reinforcement learning techniques. This survey can be helpful for researchers to acquire deep understanding of feature selection techniques and choose a proper feature selection technique. Moreover, researcher can choose one of the A, B, C, D and E domains to become deep in this field for future study. A potential avenue for future research could involve exploring methods to reduce computational complexity while simultaneously maintaining performance efficiency. This would involve investigating ways to achieve a more efficient balance between computational resources and overall performance. For matrix-based techniques, the main limitation of these techniques lies in the need to tune the coefficients of the regularization terms, as this process can be challenging and time-consuming. For evolutionary computational techniques, getting stuck in local minimum and finding an appropriate objective function are two main limitations.

AB We propose a one-shot ultra-high-resolution generative adversarial network (OUR-GAN) framework that generates non-repetitive 16K (16, 384 x 8, 640) images from a single training image and is trainable on a single consumer GPU. OUR-GAN generates an initial image that is visually plausible and varied in shape at low resolution, and then gradually increases the resolution by adding detail through super-resolution. Since OUR-GAN learns from a real ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image, it can synthesize large shapes with fine details and longrange coherence, which is difficult to achieve with conventional generative models that rely on the patch distribution learned from relatively small images. OUR-GAN can synthesize high-quality 16K images with 12.5 GB of GPU memory and 4K images with only 4.29 GB as it synthesizes a UHR image part by part through seamless subregion-wise super-resolution. Additionally, OUR-GAN improves visual coherence while maintaining diversity by applying vertical positional convolution. In experiments on the ST4K and RAISE datasets, OUR-GAN exhibited improved fidelity, visual coherency, and diversity compared with the baseline one-shot synthesis models. To the best of our knowledge, OUR-GAN is the first one-shot image synthesizer that generates non-repetitive UHR images on a single consumer GPU. The synthesized image samples are presented at https://our-gan.github.io.

DE Action recognition; Zero-shot learning; Generative adversarial networks;
   Cluster optimization
AB Zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR) is a practical and challenging issue, which compensates for the shortcomings of existing action recognition by being able to recognize those action classes that don't have visual representation during training. However, existing zero-shot action recognition doesn't focus on the fact that the generated features have many outliers, which harms the recognition. A new method for zero-shot action recognition is proposed, which suppresses this defect by clustered representation with redundancy-free features. In addition, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with gradient penalty is trained to synthesize stable features, solving the problem of data imbalance and alleviating the bottleneck of unstable features generated in existing methods. To reduce the dimension and the subsequent computation, a redundancy-free feature is introduced into the ZSAR. Experiments performed on Olympic Sports, HMDB51, and UCF101 public datasets prove that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with absolute gains of 1.8%, 0.3%, and 1.7%, respectively, in zero-shot action recognition.

ID DISSOLVED-OXYGEN PREDICTION
AB The prediction of water quality parameters is of great significance for maintaining water stability and controlling marine environments. However, due to the temporal nature of water quality parameters and the influence of surrounding changeable environments, water quality is characterized by complex nonlinearity and instability. In current prediction research, there are many training parameters and poor generalization ability, and its prediction accuracy cannot be guaranteed. Thus, this paper proposes a network model called Feature Fusion Interactive learning network (FFINet) based on dilated convolution feature fusion and interactive learning. FFINet is composed of the SCFINet module and TCINet module in parallel, and the two modules accept the same original sequence. The SCFINet module captures the local features of the sequence through feature fusion and proposes interactive learning to extract the trend, periodicity and irregularity information of the subsequence. The TCINet module uses expansion convolution to capture the long-term dependencies of sequences and uses interactive learning to compensate for information loss during separation, can process sequences simultaneously in parallel mode, and can retain irregular information of sequences. The model adds a dual residual connection to weaken the problem of model gradient vanishing, and each layer outputs sequences of the same length to be added as input to the lower layer. Dissolved oxygen concentration experiments are conducted at multiple marine ranches, and the results of the proposed model are compared with those of other deep learning models, showing that FFINet has better prediction performance than existing approaches. This paper provides important theoretical guidance for sustainable aquaculture development.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the most promising machine learning technology, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gar-nered significant attention in the field of disease diagnosis, i.e., DNN-empowered disease diagnosis. DNN-empowered disease diagnostic models with complex neural network structures are generally computation-intensive and latency-sensitive. To reduce latency, the partitioning and offloading of DNN-empowered disease diagnostic models in edge computing networks has emerged as a potential solution. However, DNN partitioning still faces two key challenges: the limitation of edge resources and the dynamic of network environments. To address these challenges, we propose a cooperative DNN partitioning system aimed at accelerating the processing of the model in multi-access edge computing networks. Specifically, we model the cooperative DNN partitioning offloading problem as a multi-agent Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing the long-term service latency (i.e., accelerating DNN-empowered disease diagnosis). To tackle this optimization problem, we further propose a swarm reinforcement learning (SRL) algorithm. Each agent of the proposed SRL can learn from local data and generate a judicious offloading action independently. Numerous simulation results show that the proposed SRL outperforms existing offloading algorithms and can significantly accelerate DNN-empowered disease diagnosis. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In decision making environments under uncertainty, assessments are frequently expressed in linguistic terms. When people express their opinions using linguistic terms, the meanings ascribed to these terms may not always align. This phenomenon is captured by the concept of a linguistic perceptual map, which draws from the established lattice of hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets. Each individual or group of people (referred to as a 'profile') possesses their own distinct perceptual map. By projecting and aggregating the opinions of these individuals or groups onto a common perceptual map, an average opinion and a level of consensus are derived. This paper extensively studies the mathematical properties of the projection function. We prove that it is a monomorphism between lattices, preserving crucial order relations. Additionally, we progress beyond existing research by introducing an interpretation function. This function facilitates the translation of the aggregated result (referred to as the 'centroid') from the common perceptual map to each individual's perceptual map. The properties of the interpretation function are also subject to analysis, demonstrating its role in preserving previous order relations, despite not being a morphism. To illustrate the practicality of these concepts, we propose a methodology that we apply to a real-world case study involving data in the form of ratings from the Amazon books platform. The results obtained highlight that utilizing distinct perceptual maps for each user profile statistically enhances the degree of consensus compared to scenarios where perceptual maps are not differentiated.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Targeting to produce new features from limited data, few-shot feature generation approaches have attracted extensive attention and successfully mitigated the high cost of acquiring sufficient data. However, two main challenges remain underexplored among existing few-shot feature generation methods, namely the distribution gaps between base and novel classes, and the gradual tightening of data privacy. In order to ameliorate the performance drop induced by the distribution gap and alleviate the laborious cost of collecting massive data, in this paper, we propose a novel few-shot feature generation model that integrates domain alignment, prototype rectification, and federated learning into a unified framework. Concretely, the distance between across different classes is explicitly shrunk via domain alignment, facilitating more precise and reliable feature generation. Additionally, we develop prototype correction to reduce the intra-class discrepancy and make samples from the same class more clustered. Such that, the negative effects of the boundary samples are eliminated and thus boost the model performance. Finally, we combine our few-shot feature generation with the federated framework to protect data privacy and propose an adaptive federated scheme to provide customized services for individual clients. Extensive experiments are performed on three standard benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. The results consistently demonstrate that our proposed model gains substantial performance boosts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the few-shot tasks.

AB This work presents an approach for multivariate modeling and multi-objective robust evolutionary optimization for processes presenting as inputs control and noise variables and as outputs a set of correlated responses regarding process performance and product quality. Factor analysis is applied to obtain a transformed output set that is uncorrelated and retains most part of the information of the original outputs. Models that are robust regarding noise variables relating this transformed output set with the control variables are obtained through robust parameter design. Response models in the function of process and noise variables are obtained through the least squares method. Mean and variance models as a function of process variables are obtained through error propagation. Robust mean square error models are obtained to model the bias and variance of each latent variable. Finally, multi-objective evolutionary optimization is performed. Three evolutionary algorithms were applied and compared through hypervolume. The approach is applied in the helical milling of super duplex stainless steel UNS S32760. Tool overhang length, hole depth, and lubri-cooling flow rate were set as noise factors. Cutting forces were monitored, while roughness and roundness were measured to evaluate process performance and product quality. The three factors, obtained to represent the six outputs, guaranteed dimensionality reduction and minimized the redundancy in output space. The mean square error models obtained to these three factors as a function of control variables minimize both bias and variance regarding noise factors. The AGE-MOEA multi-objective evolutionary algorithm obtained the best performance considering the hypervolume. Some solutions with high trade-off were selected through pseudo-weights to aid the decision-making.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Structural collapses that occur during earthquake disasters and subsequent aftershock periods often result in high numbers of fatalities. Rapid preliminary building evaluations are necessary to determine whether buildings are safe for continued occupation. Currently, structural damage is evaluated manually in on-site, expert inspections that are time-intensive, uncertain, inconsistent, and heavily reliant on the experience of the expert team. Therefore, TL-EfficientNet, which combines EfficientNet and Transfer Learning, was used in this research to create an image recognition system for use in an Emergency Assessment Damaged Building Model (EADBM). The integration of hybrid models and building safety assessments presents a pioneering approach to replace manual damage assessments. This system classifies images of structural members into four damage levels based on Taiwan's emergency assessment code, then calculates a structural damage index (SDI) based on the assessed level of damage to columns and structural walls. The accuracy and overall F1 score obtained by the proposed model were both high, with the accuracy of validation results reaching 97% and 91% for columns and structural walls, respectively. Furthermore, the model was applied to two actual damaged building case studies, with the highest accuracy and overall F1 score for columns reaching 90% and 95%, respectively. The SDI value indicates that the first case study was correctly classified as dangerous, while the second case study was categorized as restricted. This model has been proven to overcome subjective and inconsistent results associated with manual assessment, achieving rapid and accurate preliminary assessment in post-earthquake building inspections and safety evaluations.

AB Shot peening is a widely used technique in aerospace to enhance the fatigue life of a part. However, it leads to an increased surface roughness, which necessitates an additional Vibropolishing technique to improve the fatigue life and aerodynamic efficiency. Alternatively vibratory peening, a relatively new technology, can replace both Shot peening and Vibropolishing and achieve similar fatigue life and aerodynamic efficiency. This paper reports the development of a novel smart vibratory peening system, using which several experimental investigations are conducted to characterize the part and validate them using the conventional Almen strips. Data from the experimental investigations are used to train a machine learning model and predict the characteristics of the given part and hence eliminating the use of Almen strips. With the help of the feature redundancy removal technique, 79% of the redundant features were removed to retain 94% of the process information. The results show that out of various established machine learning models, the Kernel Ridge model demonstrated the best performance with an RMSE of 0.0443. With the introduction of the smart vibratory peening system, the overall process time has been significantly reduced by 76%.

DE Counterfactuals; Randomised data; Biased data; Structural causal models;
   Expectation maximisation
AB We address the problem of integrating data from multiple, possibly biased, observational and interventional studies, to eventually compute counterfactuals in structural causal models. We start from the case of a single observational dataset affected by a selection bias. We show that the likelihood of the available data has no local maxima. This enables us to use the causal expectation-maximisation scheme to approximate the bounds for partially identifiable counterfactual queries, which are the focus of this paper. We then show how the same approach can address the general case of multiple datasets, no matter whether interventional or observational, biased or unbiased, by remapping it into the former one via graphical transformations. Systematic numerical experiments and a case study on palliative care show the effectiveness of our approach, while hinting at the benefits of fusing heterogeneous data sources to get informative outcomes in case of partial identifiability.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB In contrast to a fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set, a picture fuzzy (PF) set may be taken as an effective tool to tackle decision-making problems. Fuzzy and intuitionistic fuzzy set theory can be extended to PF-set theory. As per our knowledge, there is no PF-knowledge measure has been proposed by any researcher so far. A novel picture fuzzy knowledge measure is proposed in the present manuscript. Its mathematical properties are investigated along with its validation. Its performance is evaluated using four distinct examples. Besides this, the newly presented PF-knowledge measure is used to derive a new PF-Accuracy measure. The derived PF-accuracy measure is checked for its validation and its properties are explained. The applications of the derived PF-accuracy measure are given in pattern recognition. Furthermore, a VIKOR-TOPSIS approach based on the proposed PFknowledge and accuracy measure is designed. Finally, the suggested approach is utilized to identify an appropriate adsorbent for extracting hexavalent chromium from wastewater. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID AUGMENTATION; ATTENTION
AB Cross-modality visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match visible and infrared pedestrian images from different cameras in various scenarios. However, most existing VI-ReID methods only focus on eliminating the modality discrepancy while ignoring the intra-class discrepancy caused by different camera styles. In addition, some feature fusion-based VI-ReID methods try to improve the discriminative capability of pedestrian representations by fusing pedestrian features from different convolutional layers or branches. However, most of them only implement feature fusion by simple operations, such as summation or concatenation, and ignore the interaction between different feature maps. To this end, we propose a camera style-invariant learning and channel interaction enhancement fusion network for VI-ReID. In particular, we design a channel interaction enhancement fusion module. It first computes and utilizes the channel-level similarity matrix of two feature maps to obtain two corresponding weighted feature maps that enhance the common concern information of the original two feature maps. Then, it obtains more discriminative pedestrian features by fusing the two weighted feature maps and mining their complementary information. Furthermore, in order to weaken the impact of camera style discrepancy of pedestrian images, we design a camera style-invariant feature-level adversarial learning strategy to ensure that the feature extraction network can extract camera style-invariant pedestrian features by the adversarial learning between the feature extraction network and the camera style classifier. Extensive experimental results on the two benchmark datasets, SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, demonstrate that the performance of CC-Net achieves the recent advanced level.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION ALGORITHM; DIFFERENT NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
AB This work proposes a new robust coordination procedure for the coordination of overcurrent relays that takes into account the specific requirements and conditions that arise in wind power generation plants. It is discussed here that, in those systems, coordination schemes that guarantee that protection coordination is maintained in the face of the simultaneous loss of several lines in the network can be of great importance, although this characteristic is not considered relevant in the usual transmission and distribution systems. Several new features have been incorporated in the proposed procedure, for achieving the computational efficiency that is necessary for performing the proposed task. A new mathematical model is presented, considering the characteristic curves of relays as design variables and including new constraints/penalties related to the maximum desirable relay actuation time. The proposed tool integrates a Differential Evolution algorithm with Linear Programming and a new Discrete Feasibility Search operator to minimize the sum of relay actuation times in scenarios for multiple fault conditions and to maximize robustness of the solution under scenarios with changes in network topology. The proposed robust coordination procedure with those features constitutes the first coordination algorithm designed for dealing with the reconfigured topology after the simultaneous loss of multiple lines in a network. A set of Pareto-optimal solutions is delivered, allowing the designer to perform a trade-off analysis between smaller actuation times and smaller disconnected areas after the occurrence of a fault. In the specific case of wind power generation plants, those robust solutions allow a more efficient use of resources allocated to network maintenance. A case study of the application of the proposed methodology to the protection of a real wind farm is presented, showing that the proposed procedure allows a reduction of 44.9% of the non-delivered energy in the case of the simultaneous occurrence of two faults, and of 51.9% of the non-delivered energy in the case of three simultaneous faults.

AB This study utilizes the support vector regression (SVR) model to predict the tunnel crown displacement (TCD) induced by the blasting excavation. 95 blasting operations considering the tunnel shape parameters, the blasting parameters, the explosive parameters, and the rock mass properties are used to train and test models. To enhance the model prediction performance, a novel combination of the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) with the chaos mapping (CM) called CMAOA, is proposed to select the optimal hyperparameters of the SVR model with advantages of the computing speed and the optimization ability. Sixteen benchmark functions are adopted to verify the authenticity of the prediction performance improvement of the CMAOA, and six statistical indices are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid models for predicting the TCD. The evaluation results show that the SVR optimized by the AOA with Circle map (CirAOA-SVR) model has the best prediction accuracy among all models. The results of parameter analysis indicate that the degree of bonding of bedding surface is the most important input parameter for predicting the TCD, but the blasting and explosive parameters with fine importance scores cannot be ignored either.

AB Background and objective: Soft-tissue dynamics plays an essential role in the mechanical functions of the human body. Numerical approaches using finite element modeling and mass-spring framework have been currently used to estimate the biological soft tissue dynamics. However, these approaches still have important computational cost due to the use of a mesh configuration in the formulation of the dynamic equilibrium equation and unstable convergence issue. Methods: We present in this study a novel approach based on the deep learning framework to predict the deformation of soft-tissues. In particular, the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) neural network and deep neural network (DNN) were used to deal with high-frequency oscillation signals. Different learning strategies (with and without data dimension reduction) were also applied. A simulation-based database was generated using our HyperMSM model for training and testing purposes. The application of the proposed approach on the childbirth simulation was addressed. Results: Using the root mean square error, the LSTM-and DNN-derived deformation deviation range from 0.139 mm to 1.062 mm (0.266%-2.028%) for both training and testing processes. The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.994-0.999 demonstrates the strong similarity between predicted outputs and ground truth data. Conclusions: This present work showed the capacity of the deep learning neural networks to predict complex physiological signals of the human body functions. As a perspective, this approach will be coupled with the Hololens device toward a novel interactive childbirth training tool with real-time feedback on the soft tissue deformations.

AB Model-based predictive control (MPC) strategies for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems present an opportunity to lower building energy consumption and operational costs. Such approaches rely on the development of a model to precisely forecast building thermal dynamics, such as room air temperature or heating/cooling rate, and make control-related decisions. The control-oriented modeling of building energy systems should be accurate in predicting indoor conditions and present low computational complexity. These features are the key challenge of implementing advanced control methods such as MPC. Extant studies on building modeling for MPC have focused on step-ahead forecasting techniques to forecast building thermal dynamics, while multistep-ahead forecasting is essential. Moreover, machine learning model suitable in case of the domain-based engineering expertise are also not available. To this aim, we perform a comparative analysis of the grey-box model based on a resistance-capacitance (RC) thermal network and a machine learning model composed of an artificial neural network (ANN) for multistep-ahead prediction of building thermal dynamics using current and historical data. Actual experimental data obtained from the Flexible Research Platform (FRP) in Oak Ridge National Laboratory (US) are used for estimation and validation purposes. The average root mean squared error (RMSE) of the grey-box and ANN models are 0.89 degrees C and 1.02 degrees C, respectively. The results indicate that the grey-box model outperforms the ANN model in the considered validation periods in terms of accuracy and prediction stability.

TI Ink painting style transfer using asymmetric cycle-consistent GAN
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Ink painting; Style transfer; Asymmetric cycle structure; Salient edge
AB Chinese ink painting, an artistic and cultural treasure, necessitates automatic generation for its preservation and evolution. We've innovatively observed and validated that the domain information between photographs and ink paintings, is asymmetrical, which has been overlooked by current style transfer algorithms. We propose an innovative generative adversarial network featuring an asymmetric cyclic consistency structure to address this in ink painting style transfer. This structure uses generators of differing capabilities to align with the asymmetry in transformation directions, improving image quality and model optimization speed. Additionally, we introduce two unique loss functions within the network. The salient edge loss intensifies the subject in the real photo and enhances the edge stroke of the drawn subject, a distinct attribute of ink painting. The feature-wise cycle con-sistency loss is designed to speed up model optimization. We've also built a Chinese bird ink painting dataset to validate effectiveness of the model. Extensive experiments on this and a public dataset demonstrate that our algorithm can comprehensively learn various stylistic features of ink painting, especially regarding brushstroke style, ink diffusion, and detail preservation. Furthermore, the quantitative results indicate our approach achieves superior results in generation quality and model efficiency compared to existing methods. For instance, compared to the most recent style transfer method, our method achieves an average decrease of 9.44% and 25.32% for FID and KID metrics across three datasets and reduces training and inference time costs by 46.81% and 22.71% respectively.

AB Ancient buildings are valuable heritage and non-renewable resources. Existing warning mechanisms typically rely on degradation causation analysis. However, it has limitations of complex research, poor generalization, and inadequate warnings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm, the core component is the constraint-based locality enhanced transformer (CLformer), leveraging multi-scale causal convolution (MSCC) to enhance the local features extraction. Utilizing a generative prediction to reduce error accumulation and improve accuracy. Additionally, a block recurrent prediction strategy is introduced to further optimize the model, reducing the time complexity to O k center dot k2) and the space complexity to O(k2), accelerating the inference speed and run efficiency. Then, CLformer is compared with five other models using two ancient building cases. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of CLformer have significantly improved, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value is the largest, which proves its superiority and effectiveness. The generalization and robustness are validated through ablation experiments and six additional real cases. Finally, the algorithm is implemented in engineering and employed in practice, providing valuable guidelines and applications for the conservation of ancient buildings worldwide.

AB A complementary label specifies one of the classes that an instance does not belong to. Complementary label learning only uses training instances each assigned a complementary label to train a classifier that can predict a ground-truth label for each testing instance. Though many surrogate loss functions have been proposed for complementary label learning, the mean square error (MSE) surrogate loss function, widely used in the standard classification paradigm, cannot provide classifier consistency in complementary label learning. However, classifier consistency not only guarantees the converged model is the optimal classifier that can be found in the searching space but also indicates that standard backpropagation is enough to search for the optimal classifier without needing model selection. This paper designs an effective square loss for complementary label learning under unbiased and biased assumptions. We also theoretically demonstrate that our method assurances that the optimal classifier under complementary labels is also the optimal classifier under ordinary labels. Finally, we test our method on different benchmark datasets with biased and unbiased assumptions to verify the effectiveness of our method.

AB This paper is concerned with complete synchronization for discrete-time fractional-order fuzzy neural networks (DFFNNs) with time-varying delays. First, three original equalities and two Caputo sigma-difference inequalities are established based on theory of discrete-time fractional Calculus. Next, a novel discrete-time adaptive controller with time-varying delay is designed, by virtue of 1-norm Lyapunov function and newly established lemmas herein as well as inequality techniques and contra-diction method, some judgement conditions are derived to guarantee complete synchronization for the explored DFFNNs. Benefitting from discrete-time adaptive control strategy and our analysis method, the conservatism of the derived synchronization criteria is reduced. Ultimately, the effectiveness of our theoretical results and secure communication scheme are demonstrated through two numerical examples. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Capacity expansion strategy consists of fulfilling the demand with capacity portfolio via alternative configurations with long lead time for procurement and installation. Sequential dependent decisions including demand planning and cost structure of capital expenditure shall be taken into consideration for achieving enterprise profitability. Though a number of studies have been done to address related issues, limitations of existing approaches can be traced in part to the lack of a systematic framework in which multiple objectives of related total resource management problems can be considered and integrated. Little research has been done to address the present problem for capacity expansion for matured fabs from the perspective of total resource management. To fill the gaps, this study applies the concept of total resource management to integrate operational strategies and the overall usage of resources. This study develops a capacity expansion model with multiple objectives including minimizing resource costs, maximizing overall return, maximizing revenue, and minimizing capacity risk. Since the formulation of the multi-objectives can be non-linear and the size of the problem is increasing, it is difficult to solve the problem in reasonable time for practical use. A subpopulation preference adjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (SPANS-GA) is developed to solve the decision problem. An empirical study in a leading semiconductor company in Taiwan is conducted for validation. The results have shown practical viability of the developed solution for multi-objective capacity planning for matured wafer fabs for total resource management.

AB Competitive intelligence is an important basis for companies in the process of developing competitive strategies. However, competitive intelligence acquisition methods such as surveys and expert ratings are not able to achieve rapid responses to user perceptions. In addition, the huge amount of unstructured user-generated content makes it more difficult to analyze user perceptions. In this paper, we propose a competitive intelligence mining framework for acquiring user perceptions from usergenerated content. The framework covers multiple aspects of competitive intelligence acquisition, mining, analysis, and decision-making. A unified text processing model (WS-TCM) can automatically filter the content irrelevant to competitive intelligence and quickly extract fine-grained user perceptions of competitive attributes from the huge amount of user-generated content. In addition, the quantilebased intelligence mapping method (QB-IM) determines the competitive landscape of an enterprise based on fine-grained user perceptions and provides help for managers' strategic decisions. In the case study, the method proposed in this paper has significantly improved compared with the baseline model in the stages of competitive intelligence identification, competitive attribute identification, and user perception identification. Especially, the accuracy improvement in identifying user dissatisfaction perception is more obvious. Meanwhile, our model shows strong robustness. In the competitive analysis stage, the results of the framework are consistent with those obtained by market analysts through surveys. This study provides a new approach to competitive intelligence research and finegrained user perception mining, which improves the efficiency of competitive intelligence acquisition for companies while also improving the reliability, accuracy, and usefulness of competitive intelligence.

AB The RNA inverse folding problem involves discovering a nucleotide sequence that folds into a desired target structure. Although numerous computational methods have been proposed over the years to tackle the problem, none have successfully solved the complete Eterna100 set. The Eterna100 set is widely recognized as a benchmark in this field. Therefore, there is still ample room for improvement in this area. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing eM2dRNAs, an enhanced version of our previous approach called m2dRNAs, which is a multiobjective metaheuristic to design RNA sequences. By introducing eM2dRNAs, we aim to make significant advancements in RNA inverse folding. Our approach starts with the recursive decomposition of the target structure, simplifying the problem to be solved. We conducted a comparative study of our method against several published methods using the Eterna100 benchmark. The results showed that our proposal performs significantly better than the other methods across almost all metrics and categories considered, thus achieving our objective of improving the ability to solve the RNA inverse folding problem.

AB It is crucial to develop a smart analytics system capable of accurately diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. This research uses a new deep transfer network framework to diagnose Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). The core of this framework is to employ a new Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (MALBFOA) enhanced by the Levy Flight (LF), Gaussian Transboundary Correction (GTC), Multi-subgroups, and Subgroups Annihilation (SA) mechanisms to optimize two fully connected layers parameters in one transfer deep learning model and establish a MALBFOA-based Deep Learning (MALBFOA-DL) for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy with a large set of color fundus photography obtained under a variety of imaging conditions as input. To verify the proposed method's effectiveness, we quantitatively compare the proposed MALBFOA with the original FOA, FOA-based variants, and other traditional meta-heuristic algorithms in a comprehensive set of 49 benchmark functions (shifted and swirled). The experimental results validate that MALBFOA holds a faster convergence rate and better solutions in almost all benchmark functions, especially in solving asymmetric complicated optimization problems. The proposed MALBFOA-DL model can also grade the degree of diabetic retinopathy with more accurate recall rates than the benchmark model and assist doctors in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Rescue station setup and rescue path planning are two important tasks in urban emergency rescue. The former task ensures rescue response capability and the latter task provides effective rescue solutions. When emergencies occur in cities, evacuees are distributed along the urban road network. Rescue resources refer to rescue vehicles whose available number and capacity are both limited. With the constraints of rescue resources and the number of rescues, this paper aims to simultaneously optimize the tasks of rescue station setup and rescue path planning. In the addressed scenario, the priority of each evacuee is quantified as a weight value that is used as the main optimization objective. To solve the problem, a comprehensive urban emergency rescue planning approach is proposed. The proposed approach consists of components of road network processing, road network weight calculation, rescue station setup and rescue path planning. For the setup of rescue stations, this paper employs a clustering method to provide a set of high-quality candidate rescue stations for subsequent path planning based on the locations of evacuees and the road network structure. For rescue path planning, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm is developed. The proposed method is called the planning algorithm with clustering and improved ant colony optimization (PA-C-IACO). The proposed PA-C-IACO redefines the degree of heuristic and pheromone concentration increments for transfer between intersections in the ant colony algorithm and incorporates a reward mechanism during the pheromone update process. Experimental results on six different size datasets show that PA-C-IACO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and shows good robustness and feasibility.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB As a widely used unsupervised learning method, clustering model plays an indispensable role in exploring data structures. Spectral analysis is a useful technique for clustering problems. The spectral analysis could yield good results when used in conjunction with fuzzy clustering models. However, the existing methods are limited by factors such as the definition of the similarity graph and predetermined number of clusters. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy clustering model with the approximate orthogonal regularization. To obtain the relatively stable results, we reconstruct the Laplacian matrix with geometrically-nearest-neighbor similarity measurement. This new Laplacian matrix can represent the properties of datasets. For this constrained optimization problem, by applying the indicator function to simplify it as an unconstrained optimization problem. Then we propose an algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and theoretically prove its convergence. We make some empirical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and showcase the desirable properties of the resulting solutions.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Person search, one of the increasingly important tasks of computer vision, performs pedestrian localization and re-identification simultaneously. Several studies incorporate anchor-free detectors into person search models and achieve good results. However, these methods ignore learning the contextual information of images, which is essential for improving the performance. To solve this problem, we propose a global-aware and local-aware enhancement network for person search. The stem network is constructed using hierarchical vision transformers to adaptively learn the global context. A local-aware enhancement module is proposed to learn the local context and incorporate multi-level features. To facilitate adequate learning on the limited training data, we design a symmetric online instance matching (SOIM) loss for end-to-end training the whole model. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets (the CUHK-SYSU and the PRW dataset) in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate the comparable performance of our proposed method.

AB Identifying targets of LAser Detection And Ranging (LADAR) point clouds that are affected by noise and different poses throws a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel LADAR point cloud target classification method that is both noise-robust and rotation-invariant. Specifically, the proposed method transforms the point cloud target into a slice image that is resilient to noise and holds rotation-invariance. Next, a designed 2D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to classify the corresponding point cloud target based on the slice image. To overcome the challenge of lacking prior knowledge about the discriminative features of the slice image, the 2D CNN is designed with the Local Importance-based Pooling (LIP) layer. This layer extracts the discriminative feature in a data-driven manner, thereby improving the accuracy of the classification process. The proposed method is evaluated through multiple experiments on the public ModelNet40 dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed LIP-CNN can better learn the discriminative features of the slice image, achieving high classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed slice-image-based method is capable of accurately classifying the target, even in the presence of noise and different poses.

AB Crop segmentation using cameras is commonly used in large agricultural areas, but the time and duration of crop harvesting varies in large farms. Considering this situation, there is a need for low-light image-based segmentation of crop and weed images for late-time harvesting, but no prior research has considered this. As a first study on this topic, we propose a low-light image-based crop and weed segmentation network (LCW-Net) that uses an attention module in two decoders to perform only one step without restoration of low-light images. We also design a loss function to accurately segment regions of objects, crops, and weeds in low-light images to avoid training overfitting and balance the learning task for object, crop, and weed segmentation.There are no existing low-light public databases, and it is difficult to obtain ground truth segmentation information for self-collected database in low-light environments. Therefore, we experimented with converting two public databases, the crop and weed field image dataset (CWFID) and BoniRob dataset, into low-light datasets. The experimental results showed that the mean intersection of unions (mIoUs) of segmentation for crops and weeds were 0.8718 and 0.8693 for the BoniRob dataset, respectively, and 0.8337 and 0.8221 for the CWFID dataset, respectively, indicating that LCW-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB An adversary intercepts a stream of images between a sender and a receiver neural network classifier. To minimize its footprint, the adversary only attacks a limited number of images within the stream. The adversary is interested in maximizing the number of successfully conducted attacks among all performed attacks. Upon the arrival of each image and before the arrival of the following image, the adversary must irrevocably decide whether it wants to attack the current image or not. The target model is a fixed deep neural network that may use any form of regularization. The adversary has query access to the target model, which can feed images and obtain the loss, which may contain regularization and classification loss terms. Since this paper's proposed method needs classification loss term alone, it also suggests a novel method in which the adversary estimates the regularization loss term and eliminates it. All images are partitioned into three groups based on their after-attack classification loss and treated according to their group. Moreover, this paper provides some promising test results on various datasets. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In viticulture, training a deep learning model to assess the number of berries in a cluster image requires labeling by manually counting the berries on each grape cluster. This repeating, demanding task directly opposes the need for large amounts of data of deep learning methods. The objective of this work is the development of evolutionary conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for supervised data augmentation in the task of assessing berry number per cluster in grapevine. Ninety-seven grape cluster images were collected and labeled by manually counting the berries, making up the original dataset, and it was used for the training of a conditional GAN using evolutionary schemes involving a population of generators competing within a common and dynamic environment: the discriminator. After generative networks training, the best performing generator was used for supervised data augmentation: generation of labeled images conditioned to a berry number, making up the augmented dataset. Two models were trained with one dataset each, original and augmented, both having approximately the same number of samples, around 400. The original dataset was enriched with traditional image transforms, while the augmented dataset had incorporated images from the trained GAN generator. The two models were trained using the same convolutional regression network architecture, and then tested on an external image dataset, with more than 1300 images not used in any training, to compare the performance of GAN data augmentation. Results showed that the model augmented with GANs yielded lower error values, with a validation error of 43 berries, than those from the original model, with a validation error of 65 berries. In the test dataset, the augmented model obtained an error of 39 berries (R2 = 0.75), surpassing again the original model, that obtained an error of 57 berries (R2 = 0.65). These results evidence that evolutionary conditional GANs generate synthetic labeled images that lead to higher performance deep learning regression models for assessing berry number from cluster images.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Past work has shown that any sentence using at most two logical variables admits an algorithm for WFOMC that runs in time polynomial in the given domain size [1,2]. The same property was later also shown to hold for C2, the two-variable fragment with counting quantifiers [3]. In this paper, we further expand this result to any C2 sentence phi with the addition of a tree axiom, stating that some distinguished binary relation in phi forms a tree in the graph-theoretic sense.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Applications of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) involve complex control dynamics for accomplishing any task. This paper employs a multi-UAV system for continuous tracking and end-to-end coverage of a moving convoy of vehicles to provide security and surveillance cover. The coverage is achieved by maintaining the moving convoy within the overlapping Field-of-Views (FoVs) of the UAVs. To learn the controls of the autonomous multi-UAV system, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based multi-agent actor-critic method called GPR-MADDPG. The proposed method makes use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to estimate an unbiased and stable target value of the critic. Further, the kernel function of the GPR model has been adapted to keep the high variance in the convoy trajectory in check. The rewards for training the multi-UAV system are formulated to maximize the end-to-end convoy coverage by optimizing the overlaps between the FoVs along with minimizing the tracking error. Experiments were performed on real-world road trajectories of varying complexities along with varying convoy speeds and the number of UAVs. Further tests were performed using a simulator with a real-world physics engine. The experiments show that the proposed GPR-MADDPG model results in the least amount of overlapping error and accumulates maximum reward as compared to other prevalent approaches in the literature.

AB In microseismic monitoring, various types of vibration events are often collected. Realizing the automatic identification of microseismic events in many suspected events is the basis of monitoring timeliness. However, due to the different sampling methods of microseismic data provided by different products, the data often contains different waveform sizes and sampling frequencies. This makes it difficult for existing approaches to be widely used in different projects without data preprocessing. In this paper, we propose the Universal Automatic Classification Network (UACNet), a deep learning approach that automatically identifies microseismic data in engineering without preprocessing. The UACNet model includes multiple convolution layers, adaptive average pooling layers, fully connected layers, and UAC blocks. UAC block is a residual structure with multiple convolutional layers and reset and update gates. The adaptive average pooling layer unifies the input size, and the UAC block functions as a feature extraction network to mine sufficient features from data. We test the proposed UACNet on engineering data and compare it with existing common and advanced methods. As a result, UACNet passed the ablation study, and the classification accuracy of UACNet is 95.62%, which is higher than 89.14% of CNN, 91.24% of ResNet, 91.04% of CapsNet, and 86.16% of RTFN, respectively. Moreover, the influence of waveform size, sampling rate, signal-to-noise ratios, and amplitude on the accuracy of UACNet is analyzed. The results show that UACNet can overcome the influence of these factors and truly realize automatic real-time classification of microseismic signals without preprocessing.

Training performances of approaches such as Artificial Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest in the ML-based speed estimator are tested using the datas obtained from the direct torque control (DTC) drive system of BLDC motor in simulation and it is seen that the ANN approach has the highest accuracy. In addition, a novel extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based estimator is proposed for the estimation of back-EMFs of BLDC motor. A hybrid estimation method is proposed by using the developed MLbased speed estimator with the proposed EKF-based estimator and its estimation performance is tested in simulation on DTC drive system.

AB While there have been extensive studies in the health assessment of the bearings using the vibration signal, most have focused on the constant operating conditions. The field, however, operates often under time-varying conditions as is the case of the automotive wheel bearing. In this study, a novel health indicator (HI) is proposed to address this problem based on the Isolation Forest algorithm. The method is advantageous in two aspects: the HI is not influenced by the type of operating conditions whether it is constant or time-varying. Only the data under normal condition are used to construct the HI without the need of run-to-failure data. The method is demonstrated by the three cases with different types of bearing and operating conditions ranging from constant to the highly variable conditions. In comparison with the HI constructed by the run-to-failure data in the previous literature, it is found that the trends of HI agree reasonably well with each other.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB A gait is a unique biological feature that can be identified in long distances. CNN-based gait recognition methods have achieved good recognition results. However, they perform poorly in occlusion situations. We established that different regions of the image have different numbers of features, and the higher the extraction efficiency, the sparser the features. Changing the area of different regions of the image affects the feature extraction efficiency of the corresponding regions and improves the overall recognition accuracy. In this study, we propose a free-area transformer network and introduce free-form deformation to adaptively adjust the area of different regions of the gait image. We used GaitSet and GaitPart as our recognition network to achieve state-of-the-art accuracies in the experiment. The experimental results on the CASIA-B and OU-MVLP datasets proved that our method can be effectively generalized, as compared to other silhouette-based methods.

AB Surrogate-assisted strategies work differently in surrogate-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. How to select suitable surrogate-assisted strategies to balance global and local search and diversity of Pareto optimal solutions is usually difficult for efficient optimization of computationally expensive multi-objective problems, which only allow limited time costs in the optimization process. Therefore, to further improve the optimization efficiency for expensive multi-objective problems, a surrogate-assisted operator-repeated multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed by reason-ably integrating several surrogate-assisted strategies in this study. Specifically, the proposed algorithm is based on a operator-repeated offspring creation strategy, which can produce many diverse candidate offspring individuals and thus make the proposed algorithm search globally and efficiently. In addition, a novel infill criterion termed as reference-vector-guided surrogate-assisted penalty-based boundary intersection is proposed and combined with a common Kriging-based expected improvement matrix infill criterion for complementary prescreening over the candidate offspring individuals. These two infill criteria can make a good balance between global search and diversity of Pareto optimal solutions. In addition, to fasten convergence speed, an improved surrogate-based multi-objective local search method with minimum distance-angle sampling is also proposed and embedded in the proposed algo-rithm. Several benchmark problems with dimensions varying from 8 to 50 and a practical two-objective airfoil design optimization problem with 14 design variables are tested to validate efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithms on most of problems.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Face identity and expression consistency for game character face

AB Customizing the appearance of game characters according to individual preferences is an important application in the gaming industry. The traditional solutions such as manual editing within the game engine require much time and some professional experience. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel face-swapping framework to swap real faces onto game characters while maintaining the art style of the game. This approach helps players speed up the character customization process, as they can input any face and quickly see the results of swapping it onto the character. Specifically, our framework extracts a more robust identity embedding from compound face identity models. Then the identity embedding is sent into AdaIN for feature fusion and changes the identity attribute for the output of the decoder. To maintain the expression consistency between the swapped and target faces, we utilize a novel expression embedding loss which effectively constrains the fine-grain expression similarity. To reduce the cross-domain gap between human and game faces, we also construct a game face dataset and propose to use fine-tuning to improve the image quality of cross-domain face swapping. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments indicate that our method achieves leading swapping results in both pure natural human faces and game faces datasets.

AB Deep learning-based incipient fault diagnostic techniques have achieved surprisingly well in wind turbines. Due to component failures, wind turbines must undergo active maintenance, substantially influencing revenue and power generation. Unfortunately, there are consistently uneven data distributions between samples with faults and those without faults, resulting in incorrect fault classification. Wind turbine fault classification has a significant data imbalance problem, compromising learning attention for majority and minority classes. Machine learning methodologies based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), over-sampling, and under sampling techniques for generating synthetic data have been widely employed to address the imbalance data problem. However, the traditional synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) accomplishes oversampling using linear interpolation between close minority class samples, which could be confusing, subpar, and indistinguishable from the majority class. This study suggests combining over and under-sampling using adaptive SMOTE and edited nearest neighbors (ASMOTE-ENN) that incorporate over-sampling with adaptive SMOTE and under-sampling with ENN to improve the quality of the generated samples. With this resampling technique, noise in an imbalanced dataset is reduced on three levels by using an adaptive nearest neighbor selection algorithm to find the nearest neighbors that are visible. Then use SMOTE to create samples that precisely fall into the minority class, and later use the ENN technique to eliminate instances that contribute to noise afterwards. Resampling data created by combining over-and under-sampling approaches to match the data distribution over all classes is the foundation of the suggested method's efficacy. A hybrid ensemble method is used for effective classification, including boosting, bagging, and stacking techniques. The original unbalanced and balanced data using the ASMOTE-ENN algorithm were classified using the proposed hybrid ensemble method. The classification results show that the proposed strategy is more accurate than a few imbalanced fault diagnosis techniques.

TI An improved unified domain adversarial category-wise alignment network

DE Cross-domain sentiment classification; Unsupervised domain adaptation;
   Progressive multi-level feature learning; Domain adversarial;
   Category-wise alignment
AB Cross-domain sentiment analysis (CDSA) aims to learn transferable knowledge from the source domain to facilitate the sentiment polarity classification on the target domain of lacking labeled data. Currently, two types of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods are widely used in CDSA tasks. One employs the domain adversarial strategy to extract domain-invariant features, and the other utilizes the distance metric strategy to reduce domain distribution discrepancy. However, the fine-grained domain-specific information related to categories aligned between domains is not preserved, which suppresses the performance of target-domain classification. To overcome the mentioned problem, a unified Domain Adversarial Category-wise Alignment Network (DACAN) was proposed in this paper. An integrated network was constructed with progressive multi-level feature learning. Specifically, a feature extraction module was constructed with parameter sharing between two domains at low-level text feature extraction layers. The domain adversarial module was added to enable shared knowledge transfer by extracting domain-invariant information and by updating the shared parameters at the feature extraction layers. A category-wise alignment module was built to achieve local distribution alignment at the high dimension-level semantic layers guided by fine-grained category structure information. Meanwhile, joint constraint was established with domain-invariant constraint based on domain adversarial, and domain-consistency constraint based on category-wise alignment. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on two standard Amazon review datasets. The results show that DACAN outperforms other state-of-the-art UDA methods by 0.7% and 1.1% on the two-and three-category CDSA tasks, respectively. Also, better performance results are achieved with a synergistic UDA scheme compared with a single UDA scheme.

AB Alzheimer's is a dangerous disease prevalent in human societies, and unfortunately, its incidence is increasing daily. The number of patients is on the rise, while the availability of physical doctors has become limited and their schedules are packed. Consequently, the adoption of digital healthcare systems for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become more common, aiming to alleviate the burden on both AD patients and doctors. AD digital healthcare is a highly complex domain that incorporates various technologies, including fog computing, cloud computing, and deep learning algorithms. However, the implementation of these fog, cloud, and deep learning technologies has encountered challenges related to high computational time during AD detection processes. To address these challenges, this paper focuses on the convex optimization problem, which aims to optimize computation time and accuracy constraints in digital healthcare applications for AD. Convex optimization necessitates the use of an evolutionary algorithm that can enhance different AD constraints in distinct phases. The paper introduces a novel scheme called Evolutionary Deep Convolutional Neural Network Scheme (EDCNNS), designed to minimize computation time and achieve the highest prediction accuracy criteria for AD. EDCNNS comprises several phases, including feature extraction, selection, execution, and scheduling on the fog cloud nodes. The simulation results demonstrate that EDCNNS optimized security by 38%, reduced the deadline failure ratio by 29%, and improved selection accuracy by 50% across different Alzheimer's classes compared to existing studies.

AB Recycling spent lithium-ion batteries is a significant way to achieve life-cycle management and a green circular economy, helping to achieve carbon neutrality. The form of battery pack disassembly has gradually moved away from manual manipulation to a human-robot collaborative process. However, there is no established methodology for assessing spent lithium-ion battery disassembly between the environmental benefits, technical feasibility, and economic viability of human-robot collaborative disassembly (HRCD). To ensure the efficiency and security of HRCD processes, this paper develops a resilience assessment model for HRCD using stability, redundancy, efficiency and adaptation metrics. The resilience assessment theory is used to obtain the internal relations among the resilience indicators of the system. In this work, we evaluate the resilience of HRCD for lithium-ion battery disassembly by integrating fuzzy Bayesian fusion with an analytical network process unfolding cloud. The 2017 Chevrolet Bolt driver demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which allows greater flexibility in complex tasks performed by humans and robots. In case study, the weights values of stability, redundancy, efficiency and adaptability are 0.340533, 0.161384, 0.203835 and 0.294248, respectively. IR2&HO1 and IR3&HO2 have an assessment value of 93 and 95, respectively, with eigenvalues of 1.28 and 1.23, which are level I. RI3&HO1 and RI4&HO3 belong to level IV, with an evaluation value of 38 and 45, respectively, and a characteristic value of 2.27 and 2.55, respectively. The integrated methodology proposed in this paper could be effectively used by disassembly management, to evaluate the HRCD disassembly scheme resilient strategies for better managing production.

AB In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based machine learning (ML) algorithm is introduced. This proposed ML algorithm accepts picture fuzzy sets (PFS) as the fuzzified input and incorporates genetic algorithm (GA) during the training process. The proposed ML algorithm is then incorporated into two well-known decision-making methods, namely the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS). These two decision-making methods and the proposed ML algorithm are then applied to solve a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem related to the evaluation and ranking of public listed companies based on their stock performance, in accordance with investors' personalities. The actual daily closing stock price of five public listed companies from the big market capitalization (Big Cap) category traded in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) for a period of 10 years is used as the datasets for this study. Monte Carlo simulation is used to verify the accuracy of the results. In addition, a comprehensive comparative study of some recent PFS-based decision-making methods in the existing literature and the proposed methods is conducted, and all the typical instances of the investors' personalities are observed. The results obtained through this comparative study corroborates the results obtained via the proposed methods, and this proves the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The differences in the results obtained via the different methods are analyzed and discussed, and this again proves that the results obtained via the proposed methods are effective and consistent with the judgments of human experts.

AB The development of dependable information systems in legal contexts requires a precise understanding of the subtleties of the underlying legal phenomena. According to a modern understanding in the philosophy of law, much of these phenomena are relational in nature. In this paper, we employ a theoretically well-grounded legal core ontology (UFO-L) to conduct an ontological analysis focused on fundamental legal relations, namely, the power-subjection and the disability-immunity relations. We show that in certain cases, power-subjection relations are primitive in the sense that by means of institutional acts other legal relations can be generated from them. Examples include relations of rights and duties, permissions and no-rights, liberties, secondary power-subjection, etc. We further show that legal disabilities (and their correlative immunities) are key in constraining the reach of legal powers; together with powers, they form a comprehensive framework for representing the grounds of valid legal acts and to account for the life-cycle of the legal positions that powers create, alter, and possibly extinguish. As a contribution to the practice of conceptual modeling, and leveraging the result of our analysis, we propose conceptual modeling patterns for legal relations, which are then applied to model a real-world case in tax law.

   feature extraction; Feature reunion
AB Recently, knowledge distillation has achieved excellent results in unsupervised anomaly detection. The representation difference of anomalies between teacher and student model is an essential basis for unsupervised anomaly detection. To fully exploit the diversity of anomaly representations, a novel distillation network is proposed for unsupervised anomaly detection, consisting of a complete teacher network and a set of non-directly-coupled student blocks. Instead of taking a complete network as a student which sequentially inherits the distilled knowledge from the previous layer, the student blocks are specifically designed, which independently take features of each layer of teacher network as their input and target to recover the multi-scale representation of the teacher. For each block, an adaptive weighted multi-branch feature extraction strategy is presented to enable the blocks to better focus on key messages from the teacher model. In addition, a feature reunion technique is given during distillation to make multi-scale features more robust to noisy input. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves an outstanding performance on MVTec AD dataset. Compared with the baseline method, the proposed method improves by 2.21% at ROC-AUC of image level and improves by 1.00 and 2.22% for both ROC-AUC and PRO-AUC at pixel level.

TI A multilayer human motion prediction perceptron by aggregating

SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Motion prediction; Multilevel motion attention; Fusion model; FTMLP
AB Human motion prediction aims to forecast future human poses given a historical motion. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on deep learning architectures of arbitrary complexity, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), and typically requires multiple training stages and more parameters. In addition, existing learning-based methods fail to model the observation that human motion tends to repeat itself. In summary, to address the problem of the existing methods neglecting the repetitive nature of human motion, we first introduced a Multi-level Attention Mechanism (MAM) that explicitly leverages this observation to find relevant historical information for predicting future motion. Instead of modeling frame-wise attention via pose similarity, the motion attention was extracted to capture the similarity between the current motion context and the historical motion sub-sequences. In this context, the use of different types of attention, computed at joint, body part, and full pose levels was studied. Furthermore, to address the complexity of existing algorithms based on deep learning architectures, a Fully connected Transpose MLP (FTMLP) model was introduced. By combining a MLP network with a fully connected and transposed layer to process the aggregated relevant past movements, the patterns of motion from the long-term history can be quickly and efficiently used to predict the future poses. The experimental results on standard motion prediction benchmark datasets Human3.6 M and CMU motion capture dataset show that our model is able to make accurate short- and long-term predictions.

AB Dimension reductions (DR) help people make sense of image collections by organizing images in the 2D space based on similarities. However, they provide little support for explaining why images were placed together or apart in the 2D space. Additionally, they do not provide support for modifying and updating the 2D representation to explore new relationships and organizations of images. To address these problems, we present an interactive DR method for images that uses visual features extracted by a deep neural network to project the images into 2D space and provides visual explanations of image features that contributed to the 2D location. In addition, it allows people to directly manipulate the 2D projection space to define alternative relationships and explore subsequent projections of the images. With an iterative cycle of semantic interaction and explainable-AI feedback, people can explore complex visual relationships in image data. Our approach to human-AI interaction integrates visual knowledge from both human-mental models and pre-trained deep neural models to explore image data. We demonstrate our method through examples with collaborators in agricultural science and other applications. Additionally, we present a quantitative evaluation that assesses how well our method captures and incorporates feedback.

TI S-pad: self-learning padding mechanism
SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE CNNs; Object detection; Self-learning; Padding
AB Padding is used to maintain the size of the feature map and reduce information bias against boundaries. The extra information added by these schemes at the boundary implicitly affects the feature extraction. Zero-padding introduces weakly correlated information resulting in weak boundary information, but provides location encoded information. Various padding produces weight asymmetries due to the uneven application in subsampling. With the lack of a universally superior method, it is necessary to manually determine whether the padding method is suitable for a given task. In this paper, we propose a self-learning padding mechanism, S-Pad, which extends the value by learning the boundary information of the image and provides the network with a set of 1x1\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$1\times 1$$\end{document} filters. Following the training process, tailored boundary rules adapted to the specific task can be obtained. S-Pad, in turn, effectively mitigates the weakening of boundary information as well as weight asymmetries. Our study is dedicated to probing the effectiveness of S-Pad in the domains of object detection and classification. Through our validation process, we establish the enhanced efficacy of S-Pad, resulting in an overall performance improvement for both tasks.

AB Accurate and timely identification of regions damaged by a natural disaster is critical for assessing the damages and reducing the human life cost. The increasing availability of satellite imagery and other remote sensing data has triggered research activities on development of algorithms for detection and monitoring of natural events. Here, we introduce an unsupervised subspace learning-based methodology that uses multi-temporal and multi-spectral satellite images to identify regions damaged by natural disasters. It first performs region delineation, matching, and fusion. Next, it applies subspace learning in the joint regional space to produce a change map. It identifies the damaged regions by estimating probabilistic subspace distances and rejecting the non-disaster changes. We evaluated the performance of our method on seven disaster datasets including four wildfire events, two flooding events, and a earthquake/tsunami event. We validated our results by calculating the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and accuracy of classification between our disaster maps and ground-truth data. Our method produced average DSC values of 0.833 and 0.736, for wildfires and floods, respectively, and overall DSC of 0.855 for the tsunami event. The evaluation results support the applicability of our method to multiple types of natural disasters.

AB Grasping objects intelligently is a challenging task even for humans, and we spend a considerable amount of time during our childhood to learn how to grasp objects correctly. In the case of robots, we cannot afford to spend that much time on making it to learn how to grasp objects effectively. Therefore, in the present research we propose an efficient learning architecture based on VQVAE so that robots can be taught with sufficient data corresponding to correct grasping. However, getting sufficient labelled data is extremely difficult in the robot grasping domain. To help solve this problem, a semi-supervised learning-based model, which has much more generalization capability even with limited labelled data set, has been investigated. Its performance shows 6% improvement when compared with existing state-of-the-art models including our earlier model. During experimentation, it has been observed that our proposed model, RGGCNN2, performs significantly better, both in grasping isolated objects as well as objects in a cluttered environment, compared to the existing approaches which do not use unlabelled data for generating grasping rectangles. To the best of our knowledge, developing an intelligent robot grasping model (based on semi-supervised learning) trained through representation learning and exploiting the high-quality learning ability of GGCNN2 architecture with the limited number of labelled dataset together with the learned latent embeddings, can be used as a de-facto training method which has been established and also validated in this paper through rigorous hardware experimentations using Baxter (Anukul) research robot (Video demonstration).

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM
AB Expensive multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) commonly arise in real-world situations, in which multiple Pareto solutions correspond to the same objective values. In order to provide satisfactory solutions for decision makers, plenty of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been used to solve MMOPs. However, the traditional EAs is limited in practice due to the time-consuming problem caused by a large number of fitness evaluations. To tackle this issue, a multi-surrogate assisted particle swarm optimization with adaptive speciation is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, a multi-surrogate model using adaptive scheduling strategy is introduced to reveal the many-to-one mapping relationship between decision space and objective space. To trade-off between convergence and diversity in both decision and objective space, a speciation method with adaptive niche radius is designed to perform species self-organization and evolution. Moreover, a surrogate assisted evolution with leader updating strategy is performed to guide the evolution of species. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the benchmark problem (from IEEE Congress on evolutionary computation 2019) is analyzed experimentally. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm in term of maintaining the diversity of solutions in the decision and objective space.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Automata learning; Black box checking (BBC); k-safety hyperproperties;

ID SUPERVISORY CONTROL
AB The L* algorithm proposed by Angluin is a standard approach to automata learning of unknown systems that generate regular languages. Black box checking (BBC) based on the L* algorithm is a promising formal verification of unknown systems. On the other hand, a k-safety hyperproperty is a hyperproperty that proscribes "bad things". For example, it can express safety policies for safety-critical and safety-related systems. However, conventional BBC methods based on the L* algorithm focuses only on properties, not on hyperproperties. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm that checks whether a black box system satisfies a regular k safety hyperproperty based on the Angluin's L* algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, k-bad prefix automata that violate the regular k-safety hyperproperty are generated from the regular k-safety hyperproperty described as a HyperLTL formula. Because the generated k-bad prefix automata are finite automata, the verification of the k-safety hyperproperty for black box systems can be conducted by automata-theoretic model checking. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can verify noninterference, described as a 2-safety hyperproperty, with an illustrative example.

AB Lung cancer (LC) remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis is critical to protect innocent human lives. Computed tomography (CT) scans are one of the primary imaging modalities for lung cancer diagnosis. However, manual CT scan analysis is time-consuming and prone to errors/not accurate. Considering these shortcomings, computational methods especially machine learning and deep learning algorithms are leveraged as an alternative to accelerate the accurate detection of CT scans as cancerous, and non-cancerous. In the present article, we proposed a novel transfer learning-based predictor called, Lung-EffNet for lung cancer classification. Lung-EffNet is built based on the architecture of EfficientNet and further modified by adding top layers in the classification head of the model. Lung-EffNet is evaluated by utilizing five variants of EfficientNet i. e., B0-B4. The experiments are conducted on the benchmark dataset "IQ-OTH/NCCD" for lung cancer patients grouped as benign, malignant, or normal based on the presence or absence of lung cancer. The class imbalance issue was handled through multiple data augmentation methods to overcome the biases. The developed model Lung-EffNet attained 99.10% of accuracy and a score of 0.97 to 0.99 of ROC on the test set. We compared the efficacy of the proposed fine-tuned pre-trained EfficientNet with other pre-trained CNN architectures. The predicted outcomes demonstrate that EfficientNetB1 based Lung-EffNet outperforms other CNNs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Moreover, it is faster and requires fewer parameters to train than other CNN based models, making it a good choice for large-scale deployment in clinical settings and a promising tool for automated lung cancer diagnosis from CT scan images.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Modern logistics rely on continuous tracking of even most basic entities like pallets. While tracking is nowadays achieved via additional markers (e.g., barcodes), pallets have a unique woodchip pattern in their blocks that can be exploited for re-identification if suitable methods are employed. This paper shows how this task can be accomplished in an open-set scenario. In this work, images of pallet blocks are transformed into vector representations using neural networks based on the ResNet-50 architecture. The networks are trained such that the Euclidean distance between image vectors of the same palette block is small. Several approaches, i.e., cross entropy, contrastive and triplet loss, to create the embedding space are compared. It is shown that Triplet Loss has advantages over other methods with a top-1 accuracy of 0.86 on the pallet-block-32965 dataset. In addition, a neighborhood-based approach to novelty detection called NSAND is presented, which outperforms a purely distance-based approach by up to 20%.

AB Input length (IL) is an important element in transfer learning (TL) network for intelligent health status identification of bearing (IHSIB). However, fixed IL are used in most studies. In this paper, a TL network via adaptive IL selection module for IHSIB (AILTLN) is proposed, which includes adaptive IL module, feature extractor module, health status identification module, and domain discriminator module. Firstly, an adaptive IL selection module based on envelope spectrum analysis is proposed. The module varies with bearing structure, motor speed, and sampling frequency. Secondly, group convolution, transposed convolution, and instant normalization are constructed in feature extractor. Thirdly, softmax cross-entropy loss function and maximum mean discrepancy are used for health status identification and domain alignment. The TL results of open bearing dataset and high-speed train bearing experiment show that AILTLN is better than the other existing methods in the TL of IHSIB. The ablation study shows the reuse of low-dimensional features and the adaptive IL help to improve to the accuracy of the proposed method.

AB Intelligent video anomaly detection (VAD) methods play a crucial role in conserving human resources, reducing the financial burden on governments, and promptly and accurately identifying abnormal behaviors. Frame prediction, which performs VAD by reasonably predicting normal video and distorting predicted anomalous video, is a popular and efficient method. Although Auto-Encoders (AE) show excellent performance in video frame prediction methods, the ability of these methods to use temporal information and poorly reconstruct anomalous videos is insufficient. To improve the shortcomings of AE in VAD, we propose a VAD method based on the cross-frame prediction mechanism and the spatio-temporal memory-enhanced pseudo-3D encoder. This method significantly enhances the recognition capability of abnormal activities in surveillance videos. Firstly, we use the prediction mechanism that uses multiple past frames with intervals to predict future frames. It can broaden the extra information and limit the memory consumption. Then we design the pseudo-3D encoder to encode the spatio-temporal information in videos, avoiding the problems that the 2D encoder cannot obtain the temporal dimensional information and the 3D encoder has complicated structure and overmuch parameters. Finally, we design the spatio-temporal memory block with three loss functions to store the spatio-temporal information of normal videos, which can expand the predicted differences between normal and abnormal examples. Experiments on UCSD Ped2, CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech datasets experimentally show that the proposed method achieves 99.4%, 90.5% and 74.3% of the AUC values. Our method shows excellent performance among single-stage semi-supervised anomaly detection methods.

ID SPEECH RECOGNITION
AB In this research, a method was developed for utilizing voice commands with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, which are commonly utilized in industrial automation. This approach incorporates artificial intelligence to enable human-machine interaction, aligning with the trends of Industry 4.0. A deep neural network was specifically designed for speech recognition, eliminating the need for reliance on any pre-existing speech-to-text engines. The objective was to create a model that is accurate and compact in size, making it suitable for embedded systems within industrial systems. To train the deep learning network, 21,600 sound files were generated. These files combined real factory noise with a synthetic dataset of human speech, forming a dataset comprising 60 different classes of voice commands. These commands encompassed actions like starting, stopping, and operating at various speeds for 10 motors controlled by the automation system. After applying the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) to the voice commands, the resulting data was directly fed into the proposed network. The network achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99.73%. Notably, the proposed network outperformed even networks several times its size.

AB Sleep is crucial for both the physical and mental well-being of human life. As the sleep pattern varies in every individual, it is essential to develop a methodology that enables us to detect sleep-related disorders precisely. Insomnia is one such disorder that affects humans mentally and physically. Signals from Polysomnograms (PSGs) are typically used to identify different sleep disorders. The PSG signals need a lot of handling time and are not patient-friendly. This work proposes to develop a method to automatically identify insomnia using single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We have employed a Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN), a variant of deep convolutional networks, to extract features effectively WSN is an optimized network capable of learning features that assist in discriminating patterns concealed within signals. In addition, WSNs are insensitive to local disturbances, enhancing the network's dependability and efficiency. We have used single-channel EEG derivation, C4-A1, to create six separate subsets variants based on the sleep-stage annotations, developing the model individually and collectively for the wake, N1, N2, N3, and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep stages To build the proposed model, 12,576 epochs from the Cyclic Alternating Pattern (CAP) sleep database and 20,523 epochs from the Sleep Disorders Research Center (SDRC) dataset were considered. Our proposed model has attained the highest classification Accuracy (Acc) of 97% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 using a Trilayered Neural Network (TNN) classifier considering the wake-sleep stage of the CAP database. Our devised method is straightforward and computationally efficient. Hence, it could be used for clinical applications.

AB The nonlinear cooperative dynamics of m robots with motion constraint and faulty input saturation is addressed. To the best of our knowledge, the motion constraint for the cooperative control of multiple robots is first discussed as one of the designed concepts such that the proposed cooperative control system is more practical and its performance is also improved. Together with a finite-time concept, a real-time recurrent-neural-networkbased finite-time fault-tolerant cooperation constraint control (RT-RNN-FTFTCCC) is designed to tackle the aggregately dynamic uncertainties brought about by motion constraint error, cooperation uncertain dynamics, disturbance torque, faulty input saturation, unsatisfying skew-symmetric matrix condition, and others. Moreover, the stabilized learning law includes two terms to cover all the range of filtering cooperation errors such that learning weights converge even in uncertain circumstances. Finally, the stability analysis of the overall cooperation control system is achieved by Lyapunov stability theory. In comparison to adaptive compensation control, recurrent-neural-network-based control without the motion constraint compensation, and different stabilized learning laws, the cooperative control of bi-robotic arms of 3-link in-plane with new constraint validates the improvement and robustness of the proposed control.

AB In this paper, we propose an approach to learn stable dynamical systems that evolve on Riemannian manifolds. Our approach leverages a data-efficient procedure to learn a diffeomorphic transformation, enabling the mapping of simple stable dynamical systems onto complex robotic skills. By harnessing mathematical techniques derived from differential geometry, our method guarantees that the learned skills fulfill the geometric constraints imposed by the underlying manifolds, such as unit quaternions (UQ) for orientation and symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices for impedance. Additionally, the method preserves convergence towards a given target. Initially, the proposed methodology is evaluated through simulation on a widely recognized benchmark, which involves projecting Cartesian data onto UQ and SPD manifolds. The performance of our proposed approach is then compared with existing methodologies. Apart from that, a series of experiments were performed to evaluate the proposed approach in real-world scenarios. These experiments involved a physical robot tasked with bottle stacking under various conditions and a drilling task performed in collaboration with a human operator. The evaluation results demonstrate encouraging outcomes in terms of learning accuracy and the ability to adapt to different situations. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-view spectral clustering has attracted more and more attention due to its promising advantages in data clustering, and many related methods have been proposed, among which the method based on low -rank representation have become increasingly popular. However, the similarity matrices learned by the existing methods inevitably contain some negative entries and are generally nonsymmetric. In order to guarantee weight consistency for each pair of data points and highly correlated data points to be together, we propose a new multi-view spectral clustering model based on the symmetric and nonnegative low -rank representation. This model can learn the view-specific consistent similarity matrix and also capture the local structure and discriminative information among data by imposing symmetric and nonnegative constraints on the representation matrix. By employing the compatible and complementary information from multi-view data points, it can also learn the consensus similarity matrix for all views and perform the spectral clustering simultaneously. By the augmented Lagrangian multiplier method, an alternating iterative optimization algorithm is designed for solving this model and its computational complexity and convergence is analyzed. Comprehensive experiments on multiple multi-view data sets also verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

AB It is crucial to study how thermal characteristics of concrete dam change over time, especially in cold regions, in order to guarantee long-term safety of the engineering projects. In this manuscript, an inverse analysis method by coupling the numerical simulation model and dam safety monitoring data, is proposed to solve the problem that true thermal parameters of the whole structure cannot be obtained by laboratory experiments or field tests of single points. Moreover, a numerical equivalence method of the dam and its insulation layer is introduced, in order to overcome the problem that the thickness of the insulation layer is much smaller than that of the concrete dam, resulting in low accuracy of the simulation model. Thirdly, the particle swarm optimization is introduced, in order to solve the ill-posed problems occurring during the solution process of multi-parameter inverse analysis. Considering the problem that the original particle swarm algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum and stuck edge, this study improves particles velocity and inertia weights. Benchmark function tests are applied to show the performance compared to several typical optimized algorithms. Numerical simulation and engineering verifi-cation are used to demonstrate the rationality and feasibility of the proposed method. The cases show that the residual box diagram of two typical measuring points calculated by inversion value is smaller than the median line and mean point calculated by design value. Moreover, the change law of the temperature field of the finite element calculation using the inversion values is closer to the actual measured value than that of the design value. The results indicate that the multi-parameter inverse method is feasible in insulated dam engineering. In addition, the result of the improved PSO optimization converges faster and has a higher fitness value than that of the original algorithm. It suggests that the improved PSO algorithm for thermal parameters inversion has fitting accuracy and rationality for insulated concrete dams in cold regions.

AB Cross-modality pedestrian image matching, which entails the matching of visible and infrared images, is a vital area in person re-identification (reID) due to its potential to facilitate person retrieval across a spectrum of lighting conditions. Despite its importance, this task presents considerable challenges stemming from two significant areas: cross-modality discrepancies due to the different imaging principles of spectrum cameras and within-class variations caused by the diverse viewpoints of large-scale distributed surveillance cameras. Unfortunately, the existing literature provides limited insights into effectivelymitigating these issues, signifying a crucial research gap. In response to this, the present paper makes two primary contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive study of training methodologies and subsequently present a strong baseline network designed specifically to address the complexities of the visible-infrared person reID task. This strong baseline network is paramount to the advancement of the field and to ensure the fair evaluation of algorithmic effectiveness. Second, we propose the Cross-Modality Contrastive Learning (CMCL) scheme, a novel approach to address the cross-modality discrepancies and enhance the quality of image embeddings across both modalities. CMCL incorporates intra-modality and inter-modality contrastive loss components, designed to improve the matching quality across the modalities. Thorough experiments show the superior performance of the baseline network, and the proposedCMCLcan further bring performance over the baselines, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods considerably.

AB This paper introduces Con-GAN, an innovative improvement of GAN-based data augmentation designed to address data insufficiency in fault diagnosis methodologies. Distinctly different from traditional GAN-based data augmentation, Con-GAN aims to generate realistic continuations of existing signals and subsequently integrates these continuations with the original signals. This 'real-fake-mixed' strategy fully leverages the existing signals and results in high-quality new signals for data augmentation, making our approach both safer and more effective. With rigorous validation across multiple datasets, which include both artificially induced and test-caused real faults, Con-GAN's consistent effectiveness has been substantiated. Compared to other GANs, Con-GAN presents distinct advantages, yielding new signals with better validity and variety. In summary, Con-GAN introduces a novel and feasible paradigm in GAN-based data augmentation, demonstrating practical value for industrial. In the future, we plan to evaluate Con-GAN's performance under conditions with high noise levels, exploring its robustness and adaptability across a wider range of scenarios. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB To commercialize the micro-nano needle as a drug delivery or biosensing platform, it is essential to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the piercing process for each needle material composition. However, proper microneedle material selection and fabrication requires sophisticated and costly semiconductor technology. This work aims to accelerate the material selection process of microneedles, focusing on polymeric materials due to their biocompatibility and flexibility. In this study, simulations of microneedles with various materials are used to generate training and testing data for a physics-informed machine learning model to predict von Mises stress distribution on microneedles of new materials. The training dataset is comprised of results from fifteen different materials. Different machine learning models are used, such as traditional tree-based, neural network, point cloud network, and graph-based models. Random-index selection is utilized to reduce the required number of data points by an order of magnitude. The graph attention network model is the best-performing model for predicting the von Mises stress of microneedles, with a mean square error of 8.3 x 10-5 MPa. The resulting model only requires 7 ms to evaluate a new microneedle material, significantly faster than practical fabrication in a laboratory. The models also successfully handle data with a decimal scale obtained from microstructure simulations and predict physical behavior such as stress curves.

AB An improvement in wind speed prediction is highly necessary for estimating the accuracy as well as stability of wind power. In this work, we proposed probabilistic forecasts of wind speed for predicting the short-term wind speed intervals. The optimal model has been designed by considering three different modules such as data decomposition, prediction, and optimization. Variational-Mode-Decomposition (VMD) is utilized for decomposing the primary time series data into a suitable number of modes followed by the Deep Belief Network (DBN) for probabilistic wind sped prediction. Here the Gauss-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (GBRBM) and Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM (BBRBM) are combined in the DBN where the GBRBM is utilized as the initial RBM to convert the continuity feature of the source data into a binomial distribution feature. Multi-kernel-randomvector-functional-link-network (MKRVFLN) is employed here as supervised learning in DBN to avoid long execution time and get the model into local optima. In the model optimization, a hybrid multi-objective SineCosine particle-swarm-optimization (MOSCPSO)is used to optimize the DBN parameters for obtaining high accuracy and strong stability output simultaneously. It determines the wind speed at 95%, 90%, 85%, and 80% prediction interval nominal confidence (PINC). To validate the proposed model and comparing with other benchmark prediction techniques, the data are taken from the wind farm located at Sotavento, Spain, at different time horizons (30 min-1 h) in different seasons. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the further existing model on the basis of prediction accuracy and stability.

AB The estimation of high-quality underwater images is an important step towards the development of computer vision systems in marine environments. This fundamental step contains numerous computer vision and robotics applications including marine exploration, robotics manipulation, navigation, object detection, tracking, and sea life monitoring. However, this pre-processing step becomes more challenging in the presence of back -scattering of underwater particles and attenuation issues, which lead to the formation of hazy underwater images. Vision transformers have recently demonstrated outstanding performance in many computer vision applications. Window-based Transformers (WT) show promising enhancement performance by computing self-attention within non-overlapping local windows. WT has been identified as an essential component in improving representation capabilities; however, it has received less attention in improving the performance of Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE). Therefore, we propose a novel end-to-end Underwater window -based Transformer Generative Adversarial Network (UwTGAN). Our proposed algorithm consists of two main components, including a transformer generator that generates a restored underwater image and a transformer discriminator that classifies the generated underwater image. Both components are equipped with Window -based Self-Attention Blocks (WSABs), which maximize efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows and provide relatively low computational costs. WSAB-based transformer generators and discriminators are trained end-to-end. We formulated an efficient loss function to ensure that the variables are closely integrated. Extensive experimental evaluations are performed on four independent underwater image datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed UwTGAN algorithm has outperformed several state-of-the-art UIE methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative metrics by a significant margin.

DE Multidimensional collaborative attention; Attention mechanisms;
   Cross-dimension feature responses; Local feature interactions
AB A broad range of prior research has demonstrated that attention mechanisms offer great potential in advancing the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing approaches either ignore modeling attention in both channel and spatial dimensions or introduce higher model complexity and heavier computational burden. To alleviate this dilemma, in this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient multidimensional collaborative attention, MCA, a novel method for simultaneously inferring attention in channel, height, and width dimensions with almost free additional overhead by using a three-branch architecture. For the essential components of MCA, we not only develop an adaptive combination mechanism for merging dual cross-dimension feature responses in squeeze transformation, enhancing the informativeness and discriminability of feature descriptors but also design a gating mechanism in excitation transformation that adaptively determines the coverage of interaction to capture local feature interactions, overcoming the paradox of performance and computational overhead trade-off. Our MCA is simple yet general and can be easily plugged into various classic CNNs as a plug-and-play module and trained along with the vanilla networks in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results for image recognition on CIFAR and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art (SOTA) counterparts. In addition, we also provide insight into the practical benefits of MCA by visually inspecting the GradCAM++ visualization results. The code is available at https://github.com/ndsclark/MCANet.

ID ADAPTATION
AB The semantic segmentation of unsupervised simulation to real-world adjustment (USRA) is designed to improve the training of simulation data in a real-world environment. In practical applications, such as robotic vision and autonomous driving, this could save the cost of manually annotating data. Regular USRA's are often assumed to include large samples of unla-Beled's real-world data for training purposes. However, this assumption is incorrect because of the difficulties of collection and, in practice, data on some practices is still lacking. Therefore, our aim is to reduce the need for large amounts of real data, in the case of unsupervised simulation-real-world domain adaptability (USDA) and generalization (USDG) issues, which only exist in the real world. In order to make up for the limited actual data, this paper first constructs a pseudo-target domain, using a real data to achieve the simulation data style. Based on this method, this paper proposes a cross-domain interdomain randomization method based on class perception to extract domain invariant knowledge from simulated objects and virtual objects. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in USDA and USDG, such as Cityscapes and Foggy Cityscapes, which are far superior to existing technological means.

AB Researches on deep learning methods have been actively conducted for the past 10 years, and various deep learning techniques have been proposed by many researchers. In addition, prediction methods using deep learning are widely used in various fields. In particular, convolution neural network (CNN) is most commonly applied to analyze visual images, but it can be also applied to many other data. On the other hand, fuzzy theory has been applied to deep learning techniques in traffic problem, agriculture, and airline customer service. In the case of data containing ambiguous information, data analysis can be performed using soft methods. In particular, the fuzzy theory is widely used to deal with such data. So, when the data includes vague information a fuzzy number can be applied to input/output data. In this paper, seven models using CNN have been proposed to analyze fuzzy input containing ambiguous or linguistic information. Our proposed models use five activation functions. For the data analysis, three datasets including Iris data, US Health Insurance data, Wine quality data are used to compare the seven proposed Fuzzy CNN models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrologic models require atmospheric, dynamic and static models to simulate river flow from catchments. Thus the accuracy of hydrologic modelling highly depends on the data quality. Therefore, simulation is always challenging in data-scarcity environments. In addition, physical flow measurements are infeasible in the Spatiotemporal domain, and soft computing techniques are helpful in river flow simulation in data-scarcity environments. In this research paper, an efficient and accurate Cascaded-ANFIS-based model for rainfall-runoff was proposed and evaluated using five case studies in three countries: Japan, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. The investigation focused on predicting streamflow by the influence of past data, with each river's dataset examined to determine the best configuration of past rainfalls affecting streamflow volume. The proposed algorithm was compared against six state-of-the-art regression algorithms. The results showed that it outperformed the other algorithms in every case study except the Kalu River dataset, with zero bias calculated. The developed R-R model can be considered a generic model for streamflow prediction in data-scarcity environments, with excellent acceptability of simulated river flows against measured river flows observed across different geographic and climatic regions.

AB By embedding Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework, some Transformer-based Siamese tracking network are proposed, such as TransT and SwinTrack. Nevertheless, the existing Transformer-based Siamese tracking networks do not fully utilize the object information of template branch, and their position encoding methods cannot accurately perceive the object position. Aiming at these problems, a novel Transformer-based Siamese tracking network, which includes feature extraction, feature fusion and prediction head, is proposed in this work. Firstly, an interactive attention calculation module for template branch and search branch is designed to enhance the feature extraction capability of the network for the object region and suppress the background interference. In addition, to address the problem that the existing Transformer-based feature fusion network is not sensitive enough to the object location region, a position encoding method that characterizes the relative distance is proposed to enhance the perception ability of the object location and reduce network parameters. Then, the contrastive loss is introduced to enhance the discriminative ability of the classification layer between foreground and background, and to effectively deal with the interference of similar objects in the background. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art trackers are carried out on four challenging visual object tracking benchmarks: GOT-10k, LaSOText, TLP, and TrackingNet. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is more robust on multiple challenges and can achieve considerable performances with AO of 70.1% on GOT-10k, SUC score of 45.5% on LaSOT ext ,56.9% on TLP, and 79.7% on TrackingNet datasets. It runs faster (7.1G MACs) and occupies less memory (21M), making it more suitable for practical applications.

AB Multi-source information fusion is an effective method to handle pattern classification problems. Dempster- Shafer evidence theory (DSET) plays an important role in handling uncertainty problems in multi-source information fusion. However, highly conflicting evidence in DSET may cause counter-intuitive fusion results. Belief divergence theory is one of the solutions to conflict management, which is also beneficial for the improvement of accuracies of pattern classification. In this paper, a novel belief divergence measurement method, fractal belief Jensen-Shannon (FBJS) divergence is proposed to better measure the discrepancy between Basic probability assignments (BPAs) and address the problem of highly conflicting evidence in DSET. The proposed FBJS divergence is the first belief divergence that incorporates the belief divergence theory and the concept of fractal. In addition, it has the properties of non-negativeness and symmetry. Then, based on FBJS divergence, a novel multi-source information fusion algorithm is proposed. Ultimately, the proposed algorithm is effectively applied to solve a pattern classification problem with a higher classification accuracy.

AB A distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with peak power consumption is addressed in this work. The instantaneous energy consumption of each factory cannot exceed a threshold. First, a mathematical model is developed to describe the concerned problem. Second, an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm is proposed. Based on problem-specific knowledge, three new solution generation operators, e.g., shift, swap, and speed adjust, are designed for employ bees and onlooker bees. A local search operation is developed to improve the quality of current best-known solution in each iteration. 450 instances are solved to evaluate the performance of IABC via comparing to seven state-of-the-art algorithms. The average relative percentage increase (ARPI) of IABC ranks 1 among all compared algorithms. The results and discussions show that the proposed IABC algorithm has strong competitiveness for solving the DPFSP with peak power consumption.

AB During the fight against COVID-19, module hospital saved tens of thousands of lives and families. Therefore, how to effectively select the site of module hospital is a critical issue. The site selection of module hospital is a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Recently, interval-valued Pythagorean normal fuzzy (IPNF) number has become an effective and powerful tool for handling ambiguity in decision-making. However, the weights of experts in existing IPNF decision-making are often directly given, lacking objectivity and persuasiveness. Moreover, the current research on aggregation operators in IPNFN only involves simple weighted average and geometry, while ignoring the interaction among fuzzy information. Motivated by these issues, this paper aims to develop a two-phase IPNF MCDM approach and apply it to the site selection of module hospital. Firstly, IPNF Einstein weighted averaging (IPNFEWA) operator, IPNF Einstein order weighted averaging (IPNFEOWA) operator, IPNF Einstein weighted geometric (IPNFEWG) operator, and IPNF Einstein order weighted geometric (IPNFEOWG) operator are proposed. Moreover, numerical and theoretical proofs of the proposed operators are carried out. Secondly, an algorithm for determining experts' weights is developed using the proposed IPNF social network in the first phase, and the decision-making process is conducted in the second phase. Finally, a numerical example on the site selection of module hospital is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. The numerical results of comparisons and sensitivity analysis are further analyzed to confirm the advantages of the proposed method.

AB To ensure the safety and efficiency of hydroelectric power generation, the health condition assessment and prediction (HCAP) of Francis turbine units (FTUs) have been widely concerned. To this end, some data-driven methods based on health benchmark model (HBM) and performance deterioration index (PDI) have been proposed, but there are still some shortcomings: 1) Only one type of signal is used for FTU health monitoring and assessment, which cannot fully represent the deterioration of the system. 2) The establishment of HBM only focuses on the time sequence dependences of signals, while ignoring the inter-correlations between signals. 3) PDI based on linear difference measurement cannot integrate heterogeneous signal representations to fully assess FTU status. In this paper, a HCAP method of FTUs using heterogeneous signal fusion and graph-driven HBM is proposed. First, the multivariate data of health status are transformed into spatial-temporal graphs by establishing connections between similar signals. Furthermore, a hybrid neural network-based HBM is designed to excavate the spatial-temporal dependence relationships existing in these graphs, and learn the mapping relationship between working condition parameters and monitoring signals. Finally, Mahalanobis distance between the heterogeneous signals predicted by HBM and the measured signals in the degraded status is calculated, and the comprehensive PDI for HCAP tasks is obtained by the designed heterogeneous signal fusion function. Verification experiments show that the proposed HCAP method effectively assesses FTU deterioration degree earlier with a higher sensitivity.

AB Differential evolution (DE) and Estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) exhibit complementary superiority in solving complex continuous optimization and engineering problems. The design of appropriate strategies coordinated with the two algorithms to balance exploration and exploitation is conducive to obtaining high-precision solutions. A knowledge-driven co-evolutionary algorithm assisted by a cross-regional interactive learning mechanism (KCACIL) is proposed to achieve a comprehensive collaboration between the algorithms, diverse strategies, and cross-regional individuals. Various elite-guided mutation strategies and a self-feedback strategy based on successful experience in light of implicit knowledge are devoted to fulfilling self-learning and crossregional interactive learning to accomplish individual collaboration and knowledge transfer in the three regions. Reinforcement learning based on & epsilon; - greedy and simulated annealing is employed as feedback on the crossregional individual information to promote the collaboration between opposition-based learning, interaction learning mechanism, and the revised strategy of inferior solutions with small Q values and high distance density. The dynamic self-adaptive adjustment strategies of multiple parameters are adopted to balance diversity and convergence. KCACIL is verified on the CEC 2014, 2017, 2020 benchmark test suites, and engineering applications. Experimental results indicate KCACIL is superior to the state-of-the-art comparison algorithms.

AB Food safety is a global issue; risk prevention and control of food physical and chemical testing (PCT) data are critical. However, existing studies have not considered the risk status of qualified products near the detection limit. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven paradigm to detect the combined risk of multiple indicators across products in real-world food safety datasets for the first time. The following challenges exist to achieve this goal. (1) In real-world scenarios, neighboring samples are somewhat correlated; however, capturing and quantifying the actual testing sample correlation network remains an open problem in food computing. (2) The low-frequency nature of the unqualified samples leads to label imbalance in the data. (3) Labeling dependency limits the application scenarios. This article proposes a novel self-supervised framework (SUCOLA) to address the abovementioned challenges. That jointly learns the optimal graph topology and also inferences the connections between every product node and its well-designed subgraph, helping to resist label imbalance. We applied it to a real-world sterilized PCT dataset from a province in China. Extensive experiments show that SUCOLA performance is outstandingly better than several baselines of the current graph self-supervision field. Meanwhile, we conducted generalizability experiments on five well-known benchmark datasets. The proposed SUCOLA surpasses the current state-of-the-art by a considerable margin (0.39%-8.7% AUC) on public datasets. Thus, our study provides a new idea for early warning research on PCT data in food computing and fills the gap in the study of structural learning under category imbalance.

DE Deep learning; Self-supervised learning; Contrastive; Representation
AB Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method for images and videos. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. We also show that SCE reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks.

AB Few-shot learning explores machine learning tasks under input scarce conditions. In the past few years, meta-learning has demonstrated some advantages, but most of the meta-learning-based methods proposed in this field can only be applied to the restricted version of the problem, namely, the small-scope novel-only classification. It faces serious challenges when extending the problem from two practical direction. Firstly, the meta-learning conducted only improves sensitivity on a few novel target classes but do not maintain accuracy on all-class-oriented situation or more complicated visual learning tasks. Secondly, meta-learning performs poorly when recognizing objects from a large scope either based-classes are involved or not. In this paper, we focus on metric-based meta-learning. A key characteristic of this branch of models is its training stage relies on support-set to generate classifier on-the-fly in each iteration, which in turn limited their application on more complicated tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a method that accomplishes few-shot oriented learning by iteratively using a traditional training routine and a parameter imprinting routine. Our approach closes the gap between small-scope and large-scope few-shot classifier by boosting the performances of previous approaches under large-scope settings. This is the first approach that achieves the effect of meta-learning by using traditional learning routings. The proposed approach is comparatively evaluated with a number of recent approaches on popular few-shot classification benchmarks and demonstrates better performance consistently.

AB Accurately detecting human actions in video has many applications, such as video surveillance and somatosensory games. In this paper, we propose a spatial-aware attention module (SAM) and a temporal-aware attention module (TAM) for spatio-temporal action detection in videos. SAM first concatenates the feature maps of consecutive frames on the channel and then uses dilated convolutional layer followed by a sigmoid function to generate a spatial attention map. The resulting attention map contains spatial information from consecutive frames, so it helps the detector focus on salient spatial features to achieve more accurate localization of action instances in consecutive frames. TAM deploys several fully connected layers to generate a temporal attention map. The temporal attention map focuses on the temporal association of each spatial feature; it can capture the temporal association of action instances, thereby improving the detector to track actions. To evaluate the effectiveness of SAM and TAM, we build an efficient and strong anchor-free action detector, cascading spatio-temporal attention network, equipped with a 2D backbone and SAM and TAM modules. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, JHMDB and UCF101-24, demonstrate the preferable performance of SAM and TAM.

ID IMAGES
AB The cartoon style transfer has attracted widespread attention. Although many researchers have proposed various methods to develop this field, there are still two areas for improvement: (1) existing image-to-image cartoon style transfer methods can only perform domain-to-domain cartoon style transfer, neglecting the specific color and texture of the cartoon images, and (2) arbitrary style transfer methods only transfer the style of the style image onto the content image, neglecting the style information of the style domain. To address these issues, we observe that artists often refer to specific paintings to fine-tune the color of their artworks. This behavior inspires us to propose a method that can dynamically encode the style information of a specific cartoon image based on Variational Autoencoders, allowing the style feature to be cast onto the content feature dynamically. We also introduce a cartoon contrastive learning loss to push the cartoon stylized image closer to the same cartoon stylized image and otherwise pull away. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method, Caster, can generate a high-quality stylized image with specific and domain cartoon style information than state-of-the-art cartoon style transfer methods.

AB Balancing a two-wheeled scooter is considered a challenging task for robots, as it is a non-linear control problem in a highly dynamic environment. The rapid pace of development of deep reinforcement learning has enabled robots to perform complex control tasks. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn the steering control of the scooter for balancing and patch tracking using an unmodified humanoid robot. Two control strategies are developed, analyzed, and compared: a classical Proportional- Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controller based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. The ability of the robot to balance the scooter using both approaches is extensively evaluated. Challenging control scenarios are tested at low scooter speeds, including 2.5, 5, and 10 km/h. Steering velocities are also varied, including 10, 20, and 40 rad/s. The evaluations include upright balance without disturbances, upright balance under disturbances, tracking sinusoidal path, and path tracking. A 3D model of the humanoid robot and scooter system is developed, which is simulated in a state-of-the-art GPU-based simulation environment as a training and test bed (NVidia's Isaac Gym). Despite the fact that the PID controller successfully balances the robot, better final results are achieved with the proposed DRL. The results indicate a 52% improvement on average in different speeds with better performance in path tracking control. Controller command evaluation on the real robot and scooter indicates the robot's complete capability to realize steering control velocities.

AB Deep learning methods have significantly progressed in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, deep learning relies on large labeled data for training. The cost of labeling samples is enormous. In practical classification tasks, only a few labeled samples are available. A lightweight dense relation network with attention (LDA-RN) was presented for HSI few-shot classification. First, we design a 3D feature embedding module for spectral-spatial feature extraction. A light attention module (CSA), including the channel attention (CA) submodule and spatial attention (SA) submodule, is applied to reinforce essential features. Dense connections are used to fully utilize the feature information in each layer. Second, we propose a 2D relation learning module for classification by comparing the similarity between samples, using global average pooling to reduce the model parameters. Finally, meta-learning and fine-tuning training techniques are employed to enhance the model's generalization ability and reduce the dependence on the labeled samples. Experimental results on three available HSI datasets suggest that the proposed LDA-RN outperforms existing advanced few shot learning methods. For example, the experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the proposed method improves by 5.67% on the Univerisity of Pavia data set with only five labeled samples compared to the best method DCFSL.

AB Swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms (SI & EAs) have been widely applied to various fields. In this paper, we make the first attempt, to our best knowledge, to apply an SI & EA, Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), for addressing the task scheduling problem in Device-Edge-Cloud Cooperative Computing (DE3C) which is one of the most widespread and new computing paradigms. We first formulate the problem and propose a QPSO based method to solve the problem with a reasonable time. Then we summarize the existing variants of QPSO, which exploit various improvement schemes for QPSO. At last, we conduct simulated experiments to evaluate the performance of QPSO and its variants on solving the task scheduling problem of DE3C, and have the following findings. (1) QPSO outperforms several up-to-date heuristics and SI & EAs in both the user satisfaction and the resource efficiency. (2) Existing improvement methods have no appreciable effect on QPSO for solving large-scale problems. (3) The performance of an improvement for QPSO depends mostly on randomness of the offset added to particle movements.

AB Lymph node metastasis (LNM) constitutes one of the main prognostic factors for long-term survival in endometrial carcinoma (EC). However, the previous studies on LNM diagnosis failed to consider both model interpretability and class imbalance. In this study, the extended belief rule base (EBRB) expert system is introduced to develop a novel EBRB-based LNM diagnosis model. First, the interpretability of the EBRB expert system is investigated to demonstrate the feasibility on LNM diagnosis; Second, imbalanced learning is introduced to improve rule generation scheme for constructing base EBRBs; Third, by considering the trust of base EBRBs and base diagnoses, ensemble learning is introduced to improve rule inference scheme for diagnosing final LNM. In the case study, real EC patient data collected from Fujian Provincial Maternity and Children's Hospital are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EBRB-based model by comparing with the variants of rule generation schemes and rule inference schemes, as well as some machine learning-based LNM diagnosis models. The comparative results showed that the proposed EBRB-based model has better sensitivity, specificity, and geometric mean in diagnosing LNM for EC patients.

AB Accurately forecasting tourism demand requires learning the spatial-temporal features of tourism demand, which is challenging due to constantly changing human behavior. This study presents a spatial-temporal feature enhancement model designed to maintain the integrity of tourism demand features. Specifically, the tourism system is modeled as an undirected graph and the steady-state analysis method is employed to learn spatial-temporal features. To enhance the feature learning ability for sparse features, we employ convolutional filters, and we convert the feature series into an image series while preserving the relationship of the spatial- temporal features. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated using the digital footprints of tourists from the urban area of Zhuhai. Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art tourism demand forecasting models.

TI Partial model averaging in Federated Learning: Performance guarantees
   and benefits
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated Learning; Partial model aggregation; Model discrepancy
AB Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with periodic model averaging (FedAvg) is a foundational algorithm in Federated Learning. The algorithm independently runs SGD on multiple clients and periodically averages the model across all the clients. This periodic model averaging potentially causes a significant model discrepancy across the clients making the global loss converge slowly. While recent advanced optimization methods tackle the issue focused on non-IID settings, there still exists the model discrepancy issue due to the underlying periodic model averaging. We propose a partial model averaging framework that mitigates the model discrepancy issue in Federated Learning. The partial averaging encourages the local models to stay close to each other on parameter space, and it enables to more effectively minimize the global loss. We extensively evaluate the performance of the partial averaging strategy using CIFAR-10/100 and FEMNIST benchmarks. Given a fixed number of training iterations and a large number of clients (128), the partial averaging achieves up to 2.2% higher accuracy than the periodic full averaging.

AB With the massive growth of graph-structured data, extensive research has focused on graph representation learning. Recently, graph representation learning frameworks have made great efforts toward dynamic graph learning. Although dynamic graph methods have achieved impressive results, they require labeled data for model training. The contrastive learning does not require human annotation to complete model training and has been shown to be extremely competitive in visual representation learning and natural language processing. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic graph representation framework via Tempo-Structural Contrastive Learning, DyTSCL, which trains the model by identifying three different subgraphs as a task, named Tempo-Structural subgraph, Non-Temporal subgraph and Non-Structural subgraph. Moreover, we propose a Tempo-Structural encoder, which aggregates the temporal and structural information. Finally, a TempoStructural contrastive learning module is proposed to maximize the consistency between node and subgraph in temporal and structural perspectives, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DyTSCL, we validate DyTSCL by applying it on the Wikipedia, Reddit and Mooc datasets, which show that DyTSCL can significantly outperform the existing approaches.

   Uncertainty; SMT
AB Conformance checking, one of the central tasks in process mining, compares the expected behavior described by a reference process model to the actual behavior recorded in an event log, with the goal of detecting deviations. Traditionally, it is assumed that the log provides a faithful and complete digital footprint of reality. However, assuming perfect logs is often unrealistic: real-life logs typically suffer from data quality issues, exposing uncertainty in their events, timestamps, and data attributes. We attack this problem by introducing a comprehensive framework for multi-perspective conformance checking dealing with uncertainty along three perspectives: control-flow, time, and data. From the modeling point of view, we consider process models formalized as Petri nets operating over data variables, and event logs presenting uncertainty at the event-and attribute-level. We cast conformance checking as an alignment problem, extending the traditional notions of alignment and cost function to deal with uncertainty along the three aforementioned perspectives. From the operational point of view, we show how (optimal) alignments can be computed through well established automated reasoning techniques from Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Specifically, we show how previous results on data-aware SMT-based conformance checking can be lifted to this more sophisticated setting, obtaining a flexible framework that can seamlessly handle different variants of the problem. We formally prove correctness of our approach and implement it in the conformance checker cocomot. Finally, we perform a thorough experimental evaluation on synthetic and real-life logs, demonstrating the overall promising performance of our framework.

AB With social media and e-democracy development, decision-making environments and problems have become increasingly complex. Traditional group decision-making, including a small number of decision makers, cannot deal with many practical decision-making problems. Large-scale group decision-making has received extensive attention as an efficient measure to address this issue. This paper proposes a two-stage optimization consensus mechanism for large-scale group decision-making by the Gini coefficient, which considers both the consensus among decision makers' opinions and the fairness of consensus adjustment. First, we introduce an improved density peak clustering method to cluster decision makers into subgroups that can avoid different clustering centers being too close. Then, we define the subgroups' weights by the silhouette coefficient, the subgroup judgment distance, and their sizes. Respecting the importance of minority opinions, we design a new method to identify and adjust the weights of the minority opinions, which considers more aspects than previous ones. Further, we use the Gini coefficient to measure the equity of consensus adjustment of the group and subgroup. Moreover, we present a two-stage Gini coefficient-based consensus mechanism to obtain the adjusted consensus individual decision matrices, which can ensure the minimization and fairness of consensus adjustment and allocation under the set constraints. Based on these results, we give a new large-scale group decision-making method. Notably, it is the first method that fully considers the opinions of minor subgroups and the fairness of allocation results. These characteristics are essential in decision-making problems such as resource allocation and urban public construction. Finally, we show the utility and validity of the new method through a case study and make the comparative analysis from numerical and principle aspects.

DE Advantage function; Inverted pendulum; Reinforcement learning; Real-time
   control; Robotics
AB In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that uses a multimodal advantage function (MAF) to come close to the true advantage function, thereby achieving high returns. The MAF, which is constructed as a logarithm of a mixture of Gaussians policy (MoG-P) and trained by globally collected past experiences, directly assesses the complex true advantage function with its multi-modality and is expected to enhance the sample-efficiency of RL. To realize the expected enhanced learning performance with the proposed RL framework, two practical techniques are developed that include mode selection and rounding off of actions during the policy update process. Mode selection is conducted to sample the action around the most influential or weighted mode for efficient environment exploration. For fast policy updates, past actions are rounded off to discretized action values when calculating the multimodal advantage function. The proposed RL framework was validated using simulation environments and a real inverted pendulum system. The findings showed that the proposed framework can achieve a more sample-efficient performance or higher returns than other advantage-based RL benchmarks.

Consequently, there has been a need to define cost-preserving resolution-style proof systems for MaxSAT. In this paper, we present the first MaxSAT resolution proof system specifically defined for regular propositional clausal forms and prove its soundness and completeness.

AB Traffic forecasting is one of the most well-studied problems in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, existing studies mainly utilize Euclidean distance or road network distance as the metrics at the spatial level, where the distance between two points is calculated based on the GPS coordinates. When using the spatial level metrics to construct the road network's topological and indexing structure, two completed unrelated road segments such as the upper and lower levels of the viaduct will be contiguous in the adjacent matrix and consequently be indexed in the same block. However, it may taking a long time to drive through these two road segments, which makes the spatial proximity meaningless, and this is pretty common during the morning and evening rush hours. Thus, it is very important to take into consideration of the temporal metric along with the spatial distance metric when dealing with the traffic forecasting problem.Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel Temporal Metrics Based Aggregated Graph Convolution Network (TMAGCN), which utilize the time reachability based road network weight metric, and reveal its unique characteristics. TMAGCN mainly consists of three components: spatio-temporal reachability calculation, region clustering(road segments aggregating), and traffic flow forecasting. We explore the cluster of road segments and the reconstruction of the spatio-temporal reachability graph with temporal-level information rather than spatial-level information for better capturing the latent region information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt on this problem. The comprehensive experiments indicate that TMAGCN achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than other off-the-shelf models.

DE Multi-view clustering; Subspace clustering; Self-supervised learning;

AB Multi-view clustering (MVC) seeks to improve the original single-view clustering by exploring the complementarity and consistency contained in multi-view data. While most subspace-based multi-view clustering methods now focus on exploring one of the consistency or complementarity features associated with multi-view datasets, rather than balancing the exploration of them. Meanwhile, the favored approach of combining deep learning tends to design the network structure to be relatively complex and then superimpose the constraints of multiple loss functions. Additionally, training results with unlabeled datasets are often unsatisfactory. To solve the aforementioned concerns, we present an innovative deep convolutional clustering network (SC2-Net) backed by self-supervised learning. SC2-Net learns multi-view complementarity representation and consistency fusion between views which adheres to the two principles of MVC. The clustering labels will be obtained by cooperating with k-means, the overall structure is simple but efficient. In addition, we supervise the network training by using two self-supervised loss functions, making the training process free from using data with annotations. We test the proposed network under multiple sets of experimental parameter combinations and prove its effectiveness and robustness.

ID COMMON SPATIAL-PATTERN; SUPPORT
AB Electroencephalogram (EEG) based motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are widely used in applications related to rehabilitation and external device control. However, due to the non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio characteristics of EEG, classifying motor imagery tasks of the same participant from different recording sessions is generally challenging. Whether the classification accuracy of cross-session MI can be improved from the perspective of domain adaptation is a question worth verifying. In this paper, we propose a Siamese deep domain adaptation (SDDA) framework for cross-session MI classification based on mathematical models in domain adaptation theory. The SDDA framework primarily consists of three components: a novel preprocessing method based on domain-invariant features, a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) loss for aligning source and target domain embedding features, and an improved cosine-based center loss designed to suppress the influence of noise and outliers on the neural network. The SDDA framework has been validated with two classic and popular convolutional neural networks (EEGNet and ConvNet) from BCI research field in two MI EEG public datasets (BCI Competition IV IIA, IIB). Compared with the vanilla EEGNet and ConvNet, the SDDA framework improves the MI classification accuracy by 10.49%, 7.60% respectively in IIA dataset, and 4.59%, 3.35% in IIB dataset. The SDDA not only significantly improves the classification performance of the vanilla networks but also surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods, making it a superior and user-friendly approach for MI classification.

AB Defining inter-well connectivity is very important for the water injection development of carbonate fractured-vuggy reservoirs. However, most conventional methods based on logging or seismic data are subjective. In this research, multi-attribute seismic data were used to characterize the 3D search space, and an improved reward function was designed based on the law of fluid flow and appropriate heuristics. A deep reinforcement learning model based on an improved reward function was designed to search for inter-well connected channels. Selecting the shortest channel length and the largest flow volume were the optimization objectives. We propose the multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithm with decomposition and differential evolution (MOEA/D-DE) based on an improved mutation operator to automatically obtain the optimal inter-well connected channels. The searched channels can readily show the spatial distribution of multi-scale fractures and caves. The experimental results of the Tahe oilfield show that the improved algorithm effectively enhanced the local convergence performance of the multi-objective algorithm and that the automatic search paths were consistent with the characteristics of seismic static data and tracer test results. Our model can better reflect the spatial distribution of a fracture cavity at different scales and offers important guidance for on-site development adjustment work in the water injection development stage.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown promising results for autonomous sensing. UAVs have been deployed for multiple applications that include surveillance, mapping, tracking, and search operations. Finding an efficient path between a source and a goal is a critical issue that has been the focus of recent exploration. Many path-planning algorithms are utilized to find an efficient path for a UAV to navigate from a source to a goal with obstacle avoidance. Despite the extensive literature and numerous research proposals for path planning, dynamic obstacle avoidance has not been addressed with machine learning. When the obstacles are dynamic, i.e., they can change their position over time, and the constraints of the path planning algorithm become more challenging. This in turn adds a layer of complexity to the path planning algorithm. To address this challenge, a Q-learning algorithm is proposed in this work to facilitate efficient path planning for UAVs with both static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. We introduced the Shortest Distance Prioritization policy in the learning process which marginally reduces the distance that the UAV has to travel to reach the goal. Further, the proposed Q-learning algorithm adopts a grid-graph-based method to solve the path-planning problem. It learns to maximize the reward based on the agent's behavior in the environment. Through results, the performance comparison between the proposed approach and stateof-the-art path planning approaches such as A-star, Dijkstra, and Sarsa algorithms are evaluated in terms of learning time and path length. We show through results that the proposed approach results in improved performance when compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further, the effect of an increased number of obstacles are evaluated on the performance of the proposed approach.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In engineering practice, small-sample fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment towards heavy noise interference poses great challenges for the existing Transformer based intelligent models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new lightweight model called C-ECAFormer. Firstly, inverted residual block is used to establish signal correlations and inductive bias capability and to extract richer local feature information by varying the input channel dimensions. Secondly, ECAFormer module is designed to enhance the relationship awareness between different channels in the input signal features, thereby improving the model's attention to important channels. Finally, collaborative self-attention block is developed to facilitate spatial interaction between window local and grid global in vibration signals, reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity of the model. The results of two experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach accommodates advantages of lightweight and robustness in small-sample fault diagnosis tasks, compared to the existing mainstream Transformer and CNN fault diagnosis frameworks.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been considered the future of transportation systems. However, mostly the reported optimizers struggle to estimate the flyable trajectories within acceptable accuracy and time bound under various constraints, particularly in a complex 3D environment. Therefore, this work proposes a novel hybrid optimizer (HCPSOA) by combining the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA). Further, the chaotic logistic map and dynamic weight adjustments have been incorporated to enhance the exploration-exploitation capabilities. After validating the promising performance of HCPSOA against popular metaheuristics (COA, PSO, Improved COA, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Hybrid Fireworks PSO) for several benchmark functions, the proposed HCPSOA has been employed to estimate the flyable path by formulating a novel cost function and smoothened by cubic B-spline curve. The simulated results reveal that the HCPSOA provide a non -colliding path with up to 10.00% lesser average cost for the considered real world scenario (map 3), which confirms its supremacy for the estimation of the safe and flyable relative to other compared algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The success of event camera (EC) vision in certain types of applications has been steadily shown thanks to energy-efficient sparse sensing, high dynamic range, and extremely high temporal resolution. However, the utilization of ECs for facial processing tasks has remained rather limited. To enable high energy efficiency for large face pose alignment, which is a crucial facial pre-processing stage, we aim at leveraging EC by effective adaptation of the processing rate proportional to facial movement intensity. For this purpose, we propose a novel alternative to the commonly employed constant time frame and event count frame strategies which combines their advantages and provides the benefits of supervised learning. This is realized by a multi-timescale boosting framework that can generate highly sparse pose-events at a variable rate via detection-based online timescale selection. Although detectors of multiple scales with boosted sensitivities operate as a cascade, our method provides minimal delay essential for real-time applications. Comprehensive evaluations show that the proposed multi-timescale processing substantially improves the performance-efficiency trade-off over singletimescale frames and markedly over event count frames. Mega-floating-point-operations-per-second ranges from 2.5 at the moderate motion clips to 6.5 at the intense motion clips, with negligible computation in the absence of activity. Also, alignment errors are considerably reduced by online selection of small timescales at fast head motion and of bigger timescales at slower motion or local activity of lips and eyes. Being orthogonal and complementary to spatial domain techniques, the proposed approach can also be conveniently integrated with future advances for further performance/efficiency improvements or for alignment extensions.

AB As pests can cause heavy crop losses, integrated pest management is a vital aspect of agriculture. In general, pest recognition is essential to the integrated pest management. Many studies have explored how to achieve automatic pest recognition using computer vision and artificial intelligence techniques. However, most existing methods did not consider the class ambiguity problem. That is, a pest image may belong to multiple possibly true categories, but only one possible class label is assigned to the pest image. To close the above gap, this study converted the conventional one-label pest classification task into a multi-label one. In detail, the state-of-the-art deep network, Swin Transformer, was first modified to enable the predicted scores of possible classes to approximate one simultaneously by replacing the fully connected soft-max layer with a sigmoid activation layer. Then, a two-stage supervised learning algorithm using the binary cross entropy loss and the novel soft binary cross entropy loss was designed to train the Swin-Transformer-based multi-label classification model with single-label images. Experiments on the IP102 image dataset showed that the proposed method obtained the highest F1-score value of 60.83%. It outperformed the second-best one by a margin of 7.52%. In conclusion, the proposed method can tackle the pest class ambiguity problem on IP102 better.

AB For the first time, the critical problem of selecting the most sustainable strategy for urban parcel delivery is addressed and solved in this paper. It aims to help not only postal and logistics companies but also regulatory agencies and city authorities find an environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically viable solution. Three alternatives for organizing urban parcel delivery are defined, which are traditional, united consolidation center, and inner-city hubs. According to the three pillars of sustainability, an assessment framework for practitioners is proposed. This paper introduces a linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy Choquet integral approach to evaluate sustainable strategies for urban parcel delivery. The linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy Choquet integral averaging and linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy Choquet integral geometric operators have been constructed for the first time for this purpose. The operator-related qualities are demonstrated. The operators are used to create a multi-criteria group decision-making approach. The case study of the city of Belgrade illustrates the practical applicability of the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy Choquet integral approach. This research findings show that the united consolidation center is the most sustainable strategy for organizing urban parcel delivery.

AB Deep-learning-based semantic segmentation networks typically incorporate object classification networks in their backbone. This leads to a loss of context because classification networks have a smaller field of view. The architecture has been extended to recover context with additional downsampling feature maps, a parallel context branch, or pyramid pooling modules after the backbone. However, these extensions increase multiply- accumulate operations and memory requirements, thus, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To overcome this limitation, a novel convolutional building block with attention-based context guidance is proposed. The block is repeated to build an efficient encoder-decoder network. Our network runs in real-time, has a lightweight design with only 0.72 Million parameters, and achieves 70.1%, and 66.3% mean intersection-over-union scores on the highly competitive Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, respectively. An efficient decoder is also designed to replace other semantic segmentation network decoders with minimal performance loss. The performance measures on mobile platforms show that our network suits resource-constrained devices. Further, experimental results show that the proposed method can optimally balance the model size-inference speed and segmentation accuracy.

AB Social network group consensus is a hybrid cooperative and non-cooperative problem, with the management of non-cooperative behavior as a key topic. In response, this study investigates the reconciliation mechanism to manage non-cooperative behaviors based on a cooperative intention index (CII). First, a CII index driven by preference similarity and trust relationships is constructed, which predicts the compromise domain of decision makers (DMs). Subsequently, this study recognizes three types of non-cooperative behaviors from the group and individual proposal perspectives in turn: (i)Type-1 cooperation with the group; (ii)Type-2 non-cooperation with the group but cooperation with the individual; and (iii)Type-3 non-cooperation with both the group and the individual. Then, reconciliation mechanisms applicable to different types of mediation are proposed. Then, group-orientated, individual-orientated and compulsory reconciliation mechanisms are proposed for different types. Finally, a demonstration example and discussions are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model.

   Attention retention
AB The co-salient object detection (Co-SOD) aims to discover common, salient objects from a group of images. With the development of convolutional neural networks, the performance of Co-SOD methods has been significantly improved. However, some models cannot construct collaborative relationships across images optimally and lack effective retention of collaborative features in the top-down decoding process. In this paper, we propose a novel group attention retention network (GARNet), which captures excellent collaborative features and retains them. First, a group attention module is designed to construct the inter-image relationships. Second, an attention retention module and a spatial attention module are designed to retain inter-image relationships for protecting them from being diluted and filter out the cluttered context during feature fusion, respectively. Finally, considering the intra-group consistency and inter-group separability of images, an embedding loss is additionally designed to discriminate between real collaborative objects and distracting objects. The experiments on four datasets (iCoSeg, CoSal2015, CoSoD3k, and CoCA) show that our GARNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

TI Boosting facial recognition capability for faces wearing masks using

SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Masked face recognition; Quadruplet loss; Biometrics; Attention
AB Masked face recognition gained importance after the outbreak of COVID-19 when people started wearing facial masks to protect themselves against disease. The performance of existing face recognition systems is declined on the images of persons wearing face masks because the discriminative facial features are hidden under the mask. In addition, face recognition algorithms proposed for handling masked face recognition scenarios exhibit degraded performance in unmasked face recognition settings. Therefore, there is a need for a solution that can perform well in masked-face scenarios and maintains the same performance while recognizing the unmasked faces. In this paper, we propose a Masked Face Unveiling Model (MFUM), which can be added to the backbone of existing facial recognition systems and improves the performance of existing approaches in masked face settings without the need to retrain the current models. The MFUM utilizes the masked face embedding produced by the existing face recognition model backbone and uses attention augmented residual model for recognition. It enhances the similarity of masked face embedding with the unmasked face embedding of the same identity and diminishes the similarity with the unmasked facial embedding of the different identities. We experimented with different face recognition models' backbone, MFUM alternative architectures, and attention mechanisms on the MFR2 dataset with real masked faces and the LFW dataset with synthetic masks. The results show that the proposed Masked Face Unveiling-Attention Augmented Dense Residual Unit trained with quadruplet loss outperformed not only other MFUM architectures and losses but also exhibited superior performance as compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Multispectral images can provide more information, so pedestrian detection based on multispectral images has received wide attention. Existing multispectral networks mainly focus on the misalignment of image pairs and the difference between modalities. However, these network structures lack effective information interaction between two feature streams and fail to consider the scale characteristics of pedestrian objects. To deal with this issue, we propose a high-performance network structure, which is called dual-stream interaction and multi-scale feature extraction network (DSI-MSE), and contains a dual-stream feature interaction (DSI) block, a multi-scale feature extraction (MSE) block and a detection (DET) block. The DSI block extracts the features through the dual-stream interaction of RGB images and thermal images, which fuses the intra-modal information and the inter-modal information. The MSE block is designed by multiple parallel branches for matching multiple scales of pedestrian, which enhances the expressiveness of features and refines richer feature expressions at different scales. Experimental results on KAIST and CVC-14 datasets demonstrate that the proposed DSI-MSE can obtain the state-of-the-art results on multi-spectral pedestrian detection tasks.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In real-life industry it is difficult to have fully-labelled datasets due to lack of time, resources or knowledge. In this sense, this paper proposes the design and development of a Partial Labelling Autonomous Hyper-heuristic System PLAHS, a solution that autonomously labels partially labelled databases and evaluates the yielded labelling solution by means of a novel Trustworthiness Metric (TM). The proposal combines a hyper-heuristic inspired approach with a Semi Supervised Learning Clustering (SSLC) methodology that optimizes the parameters of different clustering algorithms, based on a novel semi-supervised metric named Partially Supervised Optimization Metric (PSOM). The proposal has been tested with promising and excellent results on both a real use case for labelling work orders in a cold stamping press, and 13 databases from the UCI (multivariate data) and UCR (time series data) repositories. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Social commitments are recognized as an abstraction that enables flexible coordination between autonomous agents. We make these contributions. First, we introduce and formalize a concept of a maintenance commitment, a kind of social commitment characterized by a maintenance condition whose truthhood an agent commits to maintain. This concept of maintenance commitments enables us to capture a richer variety of real-world scenarios than possible using achievement commitments with a temporal condition. Second, we develop a rule-based operational semantics, by which we study the relationship between agents' achievement and maintenance goals, achievement commitments, and maintenance commitments. Third, we motivate a notion of coherence between an agents' achievement and maintenance cognitive and social constructs, and prove that, under specified conditions, the goals and commitments of both rational agents individually and of a multiagent system altogether are coherent. Fourth, we illustrate our approach with a detailed realworld scenario from an aerospace aftermarket domain. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Developing energy-efficient buildings considering building design parameters can help reduce buildings' energy consumption. The energy efficiency of residential buildings is considered a top priority for the energy policies of a country. Thus, this study utilizes gene-expression programming (GEP) to estimate the energy performance of residential buildings. The energy consumption evaluations were carried out using the Etotect energy simulation software. Eight building parameters with 768 data points were considered to generate the database for the heating load (H-L) and cooling load (C-L), including relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall building height, glazing orientation, glazing area, and distribution of glazing area. Different GEP predictive models with varying parameters for building H-L and C-L were developed, and the best-performing prediction model was selected. In addition, several statistical indices were utilized to measure the accuracy of the proposed GEP models. The results revealed that GEP14 gives the most robust prediction model for H-L having R-2-value greater than 0.9 for both the training and validation set. Likewise, R-2-value >0.9 is achieved for best- C-L (GEP11). Furthermore, the mean absolute error (MAE) values for both the predictive H-L' and C-L' by prediction models were relatively less for both the training and testing databases. The sensitivity and parametric analysis reveal that the overall height (H-o), roof area (A(f)), and glazing area (A(g)) were the most influential parameters for both predictive models. Thus, GEP results demonstrate the robust performance in predicting the building energy.

AB Pulmonary Embolism (PE) - a non-cardiac cause of cardiac arrest is a strenuous job to perform as it is non-specific in presentation and shares various overlapping features with various other clinical disorders like Myocardial Infarction, Pneumonia, etc. This paper delineates a method to identify Pulmonary Embolism (PE) as a reason for Heart Failure using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. The methodology has been partitioned into two phases. Phase I acts towards the creation of a novel dataset as there was no data available for this particular problem statement. Phase II deals with the scope and application of the DRL algorithm on the above-invented dataset. The dataset formed is imbalanced in its essence. To effectively tackle the imbalanced dataset challenge, a cutting-edge imbalanced classification algorithm rooted in the power of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been embraced. The classification model has been drawn up as a Sequential Decision-Making procedure and is resolved by making use of the DRL algorithm viz Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN). A classification action is performed by an agent on a single sample at each time step. Classification actions are assessed by the environment, based on the assessment, a reward is given to an agent. In order to make the agent more responsive towards the minority class samples, rewards belonging to the minority class are higher. Under the supervision of this reward system, the agent finally learns the optimal classification policy for this imbalanced dataset problem. Comparative analysis of the DDQN algorithm with other Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, including Dueling DQN, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithms has been performed in order to arrive at the best learning technique for the dataset. Furthermore, the DDQN algorithm has been evaluated against a selection of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. From the experimentation, it is demonstrated that the DDQN model outperformed other approaches with an accuracy of 99.99%, G-mean 0.9999, Recall 1.0000, and Specificity 0.9999.

AB Differential evolution is one of the most powerful stochastic real-parameter optimization algorithms currently, and its performance depends heavily on control parameters and mutation strategy. In recent years, methods to select favorable parameters control and mutation strategy when solving various optimization problems have attracted increasing attention. To choose an appropriate mutation strategy and control parameters for a given optimization problem, in this paper, a Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm Based on Deeply-Informed Mutation Strategy and Restart Mechanism (ADEDMR) is proposed, and the ADEDMR algorithm has the following characteristics: First, a deeply-informed mutation strategy is proposed, which takes into account the information of suboptimal solutions discarded by selection and inherits the advantages of the powerful "DE/target-pbest/1/bin", aiming to obtain a better perceptual landscape of the target function and improve the candidate diversity of the trial vector. Second, according to the evolution process, the segmentation method is used to control ������, which alleviates the scaling of ������in the wrong direction, and makes the newly generated ������fit more accurately. Third, a new population restart mechanism is adopted to further enhance population diversity by adaptively enhancing the search ability of hopeless individuals and randomly replacing some inferior individuals with wavelet walks. To evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, comparative experiments are conducted on 72 benchmark functions from the CEC2014, CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites. Experimental results show that the proposed ADEDMR has higher convergence accuracy, better optimization ability when solving high-dimensional complex functions, and is competitive with six recent strong DE variants.

AB In this paper we propose a new class of contrapositivisation operators for fuzzy implications called (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisators and whose generators are quasi-overlaps, quasigroupings and fuzzy negations. We show that (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisators generalize medium contrapositivisators and (G,N)-contrapositivisators. We present a brief study on the notion of N-compatibility for (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisations and show that the class of (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisators is invariant by the action of automorphisms. We extensively study the characterizations of (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisators with respect to the main properties that are generally satisfied by fuzzy implications. This study was done from two points of view: first, considering that the input implication is arbitrary and second, assuming that the universe of the input implications consists of four specific classes of fuzzy implications generated from overlaps and/or groupings. In addition, we present new methods to construct quasi-overlap (overlap) and quasi-grouping (grouping) functions from (Q O,Q G,N)-contrapositivisators.

AB In recent years, enormous research has been carried out on the segmentation of blood vessels. Segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images is crucial for diagnosing, treating, evaluating clinical results, and early detection of eye disorders. A successful segmentation accurately reflects the blood vessels' structure and helps obtain patterns that can be used to identify retinal disorders and diseases. Most recent research on vessel segmentation employs multiple processes to determine the appropriate segmentation. Finding the best techniques for segmentation is a complex process. In certain circumstances, it requires a thorough understanding of every step that can only be acquired through years of training. Comprehension and expertise in segmentation procedures are essential for accurate segmentation. This paper briefly introduces the segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images, describes many preprocessing and segmentation techniques, and summarizes challenges and trends. Furthermore, the limitations of the current systems will be identified.

ID INFORMATION
AB The diversity of natural language expressions for describing events poses a challenge for the task of Event Detection (ED) with machine learning methods. To detect and classify event mentions, ED models essentially need to construct a semantic linkage between representations of the mentions and a set of target types. Unfortunately, most existing models use meaningless homogeneous one-hot vectors to represent the event type classes in ED, ignoring the fact that the event type labels also consist of meaningful words and can provide important clues for type representation learning. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Semantic Prototype Representation Learning Framework for Event Detection (SemPRE), which exploits the pre-defined event type label words to inject the semantic information of the types and guide event detection. Specifically, we utilize pre-trained BERT to fuse text and event type into a joint representation space, and employ a contrastive-regularized module to enhance cross-type interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the ACE 2005 and MAVEN benchmark datasets. The performance results show that our proposed SemPRE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the datasets and outperforms existing baselines on limited annotated data and without using any external resources. Further analysis shows that our model is also effective in detecting multiple events and ambiguous trigger words.

AB Under boundary measurement (BM), this paper solves the synchronization problem via intermittent boundary proportional-derivative (PD) control of delayed reaction-diffusion neural networks (RDNNs), where the random time-varying delay (RTVD) belongs to two intervals and is considered by a probabilistic way to take the influence of uncertain factors. The intermittent boundary PD synchronization scheme, which considers the inevitable actuator limitations, is based on BM and only available at some specified boundary position. By using the inequality techniques and switching Lyapunov functional, the mean square exponential stability (MSES) of the synchronization error system (SES) containing the response and drive dynamics is ensured by some synchronization criteria, which are established via an intermittent boundary PD controller under BM and expressed as linear matrix inequalities. Lastly, the proposed intermittent boundary PD synchronization approach is verified by a numerical example.

ID SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AB With new developments in the field of human-computer interaction, researchers are now paying attention to emotion recognition, especially multimodal emotion recognition, as emotion is a multidimensional expression. In this study, we propose a multimodal fusion emotion recognition method (MTL-BAM) based on multitask learning and the attention mechanism to tackle the major problems encountered in multimodal emotion recognition tasks regarding the lack of consideration of emotion interactions among modalities and the focus on emotion similarity among modalities while ignoring the differences. By improving the attention mechanism, the emotional contribution of each modality is further analyzed so that the emotional representations of each modality can learn from and complement each other to achieve better interactive fusion effect, thereby building a multitask learning framework. By introducing three types of monomodal emotion recognition tasks as auxiliary tasks, the model can detect emotion differences. Simultaneously, the label generation unit is introduced into the auxiliary tasks, and the monomodal emotion label value can be obtained more accurately through two proportional formulas while preventing the zero value problem. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms selected state-of-the-art methods on four evaluation indexes of emotion classification (i.e., accuracy, F1 score, MAE, and Pearson correlation coefficient). The proposed method achieved accuracy rates of 85.36% and 84.61% on the published multimodal datasets of CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, respectively, which are 2-6% higher than those of existing state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good multimodal emotion recognition performance and strong generalizability.

AB Recently, practitioners and researchers have concentrated on the use of meta-heuristics in the design of multi-objective supply chain networks. The number of publications in this field reflects this interest. The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel metaheuristic approach for designing supply chain network problems in the case of multi-objective supply chains. The proposed algorithm hybridizes three meta-heuristic approaches; simulated annealing, tabu search, and variable neighborhood algorithms. The proposed algorithm is also combined with a linear programming approach. The purpose of hybridization is to aggregate the approaches in order to benefit from the advantages of these solution algorithms. The features of these algorithms are investigated in this paper for the first time. The most useful characteristics of each algorithm are then utilized for developing the new algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with an exact algorithm, simulated annealing, and tabu search algorithms. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the exact in the case of small and medium-sized supply chain problems.

AB Research on machine activity recognition (MAR) is drawing more attention because MAR can provide productivity monitoring for efficiency optimization, better maintenance scheduling, product design improvement, and potential material savings. A particular challenge of MAR for human-operated machines is the overlap when transiting from one activity to another: during transitions, operators often perform two activities simultaneously, e.g., lifting the fork already while approaching a rack, so the exact time when one activity ends and another begins is uncertain. Machine learning models are often uncertain during such activity transitions, and we propose a novel ensemble-based method adapted to fuzzy transitions in a forklift MAR problem. Unlike traditional ensembles, where models in the ensemble are trained on different subsets of data, or with costs that force them to be diverse in their responses, our approach is to train a single model that predicts several activity labels, each under a different context. These individual predictions are not made by independent networks but are made using a structure that allows for sharing important features, i.e., a context ensemble. The results show that the gated recurrent unit network can provide medium or strong confident context ensembles for 95% of the cases in the test set, and the final forklift MAR result achieves accuracies of 97% for driving and 90% for load-handling activities. This study is the first to highlight the overlapping activity issue in MAR problems and to demonstrate that the recognition results can be significantly improved by designing a machine learning framework that addresses this issue.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has attracted significant interest among researchers owing to its diverse practical applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been extensively utilized for HSI classification. However, the effectiveness of CNN-based approaches is constrained by the fixed size and structure of the convolutional kernels, as well as their incapacity to capture global features. Moreover, these networks are inadequate in modeling the sequential characteristics of data. Recently, a promising approach, window-based multi-head self-attention has emerged to address the limitations of CNNs and incorporate efficient sequence modeling capabilities. This paper introduces a novel method, multiscale 3D atrous convolution with a lightweight swin transformer (MACLST), that effectively combines the strengths of two networks to capture both local and global features at different scales in HSI classification. The MACLST is designed to process HSI cubes as input and employs a spectral-spatial features extraction module based on multiscale 3D atrous convolution. This module involves parallel branches of 3D layers with varying atrous rates, enabling the extraction of features at multiple scales and resolutions. The extracted spectral-spatial features are fused and passed to the lightweight Swin transformer module as linear embeddings. This module captures longrange dependencies and learns effective feature representations of HSI. To reduce computational complexity, the swin transformer module is simplified and consists of only two stages, offering a more efficient version of the original swin transformer. The proposed MACLST model is extensively evaluated on five widely used benchmark HSI datasets, and the experimental results validate its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches with an overall accuracy of 99.00%, 99.59%, 99.95%, 98.71%, and 94.98% on the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, Salinas Valley, Houston University 2013, and Houston University 2018 datasets, respectively.

AB The Internet is a crucial way to share information in both personal and professional areas. Sentiment analysis attracts great interest in marketing, research, and business today. The instability faced by imbalanced datasets on sentiment analysis is examined in this research. Balancing the datasets using techniques based on under-sampling and over-sampling is examined to achieve more efficient classification results as the effects of using BERT as word embedding and ensemble learning methods for classification. The effects of the resampling training set algorithms on different deep learning classifiers were investigated using BERT as a word embedding model and Cohen's kappa, accuracy, ROC-AUC curve, and MCC as evaluation metrics with k-fold validation on three sentiment analysis datasets containing English, Arabic, and Moroccan Arabic Dialect texts. Also, we did those performance metrics for all models when scaling the dataset for training and testing, and we calculated the memory and the execution time for each model. Finally, we analyzed the National Office of Railways of Morocco (ONCF) customers' Facebook comments in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and MD to determine customer satisfaction as positive, negative, and neutral comments.

ID ADAPTIVE HISTOGRAM EQUALIZATION; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; GAMMA-CORRECTION
AB Photos taken under nighttime or backlit conditions often suffer from complex and unpredictable degradation, such as low visibility, messy noise, and distorted color. Previous methods mainly focused on global brightness and contrast while ignoring structural and textural details, or they handled the fusion of features without adequately considering their intrinsic association, resulting in incomplete feature representations. To address this issue, we propose a global-and-local aware network (GLAN) by projecting the features into the frequency domain and incorporating them in a knowledge-sharing manner. This method effectively integrates the global modeling capability of the transformer and the local sensitivity of the convolutional neural network to represent structure and texture. First, the global branch, which is comprised of transformer blocks, performs feature extraction under the global receptive field, while the local branch constructs multi-scale features to provide local fine-grained details. Then, we design a novel adaptive multi-scale feature block (AMSFB) that deploys channel split operation to decrease the calculation amount. To better learn the channel and spatial correlations of intermediate features, we introduce a multi-scale channel attention module (MSCAM) and a pixel attention module (PAM) into the AMSFB. Finally, a frequency-aware interaction module (FAIM) is developed for bidirectional information supplementation, which builds feature descriptors simultaneously covering low-frequency and high-frequency information based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, our method can achieve competitive results compared with over ten state-of-the-art image enhancement methods on eight benchmark datasets.

AB A significant challenge in automated defect inspection (ADI) of aluminum strip surfaces is improving segmentation speed to satisfy the online inspection requirements of the production line while maintaining the precision of defect identification. This study proposes a lightweight and efficient defect segmentation model that can be applied in aluminum processing enterprises for fast and precise segmentation of aluminum strip surface defects. A novel fusion attention (FA) mechanism is first established to enhance the focus on critical characteristics along the spatial and channel dimensions. This mechanism adopts continuous dilated convolutions with appropriate dilation rates to effectively increase the range of the receptive field and improve defect localization accuracy. Subsequently, a lightweight MobileViTv2 with an embedded FA mechanism is employed as a multi-scale feature extractor to learn comprehensive representations from defect images. Next, a novel feature fusion method, named large-scale feature pyramid network (LSFPN), is introduced to enhance the focus on details within large-scale features. LSFPN establishes four progressively shallower top-down pathways with fast normalized fusion weights and incorporates lightweight aggregation nodes based on the MoblieNetv2 block. Surface images of straightened aluminum strips with five universal defects were collected, whereby a new dataset was established. The experimental outcomes demonstrate the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques synthetically, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 87.01%, a segmentation speed of 61.67 fps, and a model size of 16.23 MB. This model may serve as a valuable theoretical foundation for the online segmentation of aluminum strip surface defects in embedded devices.

To illustrate the capabilities of the proposal in a real-world scenario, HAP is tested on the Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (Ariel) mission of the European Space Agency (ESA), and compared with other studies on this subject including an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) approach. The results show that the proposal outperforms the other methods in the evaluation and achieves better scientific goals than its peers. The consistency of HAP in obtaining better results on the available datasets for Ariel, with various sizes and constraints, demonstrates its competence in scalability and adaptability to different conditions of the problem.

AB PM2.5 Prediction is a complex task of large-scale spatio-temporal analysis, which not only needs comprehension of static geospatial knowledge and relative features but also needs to analyze the real-time situation. This paper discusses the characteristics of the static graph and the dynamic graph in spatio-temporal series tasks. An Adaptive Scalable Spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network(ASGCN) model is proposed to predict PM2.5. To capture and analyze the characteristics of the time series period of PM2.5, a time convolution network based on the strategies of inception and gating is proposed and used as a temporal module. A dynamic graph idea is adopted to distinguish the spatio-temporal similarity of different periods. And an adaptive weighted multilayer graph convolution network is used to process static and dynamic graphs, aiming to analyze the spatial relationship of PM2.5 stations. The convolution network with the inception and gating improves the time-series feature capture ability, and adaptive static and dynamic graphs enhance the spatial relationship analysis ability. The temporal and spatial modules of the model are relatively independent, which benefits obtaining the potential information of datasets to improve the prediction accuracy. At the same time, these modules cooperate to make the model adaptable to various data. We choose a great number of comparative models and design a thorough experimental scheme including single-step prediction, multi-step prediction, hyperparameter experiments, and ablation experiments on two real PM2.5 datasets collected in China. Finally, the model achieves performance close to or better than the current state-of-the-art models selected for comparison in prediction tasks.

AB In this paper, a novel deep-learning network for the brightness enhancement of old images is proposed. Although the task for brightness enhancement of old images is similar to the low-light enhancement problem of modern images, the causes of darkness and image characteristics are significantly different. Unlike modern images, bright degradation in old images is due to low-quality camera sensors, unsophisticated techniques that capture the images, and the harsh environment where the photos/films were stored. Though existing low-light enhancement networks show good reconstruction capabilities for modern images, they result in overexposed, color-distorted outputs if applied to old images. To resolve these, we propose a novel deep-learning network with a combination of two convolutional neural networks, which estimates curve maps to adjust the dynamic range, and an attention-guided illumination map to adjust the illumination of the given input image. In addition, channel attention blocks in the illumination map estimation network are further performed to reduce image noise and prevent over- or underexposure. The networks perform in parallel to enhance the brightness of the image and preserve inherent colors and texture details. The proposed method was evaluated on the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) and compared with the state-of-the-art methods on a dataset containing old video frames from different decades. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality for brightness enhancement on old photo and video datasets.

AB Convolutional- and Transformer-based backbone architecture are two dominant, widely accepted, models in computer vision. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge, thus a focus of research, to decide which backbone architecture performs better, and under which circumstances. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the differences of the macroscopic backbone design of the CNN and Transformer models with the ultimate purpose of developing new models to combine the strengths of both types of architectures for effective image classification. Specifically, we first analyze the model structures of both models and identified four main differences, then we design four sets of ablation experiments using the ImageNet-1K dataset with an image classification problem as an example to study the impacts of these four differences on model performance. Based on the experimental results, we derive four observations as rules of thumb for designing a vision model backbone architecture. Informed by the experiment findings, we then conceive a novel model called CMNet which marries the experiment-proved best design practices of CNN and Transformer architectures. Finally, we carry out extensive experiments on CMNet using the same dataset against baseline classifiers. Initial results prove CMNet achieves the highest top-1 accuracy of 80.08% on the ImageNet-1K validation set, this is a very competitive value compared to previous classical models with similar computational complexity. Details of the implementation, algorithms and codes, are publicly available on Github: https://github.com/Arwin-Yu/CMNet.

AB Graph is a widely applied technique to characterize the relationship among data. Due to the excellent ability to handle nonlinear data and extract the useful information contained in base kernels, learning the connecting graph based on multiple kernel learning has been extensively discussed. Many existing algorithms construct the connecting graph based on the optimal kernel which is learned from base kernels. Observing these methods, we find they (1) ignore the local structure of data; (2) cannot assure that the optimal kernel is positive semi-definite; (3) cannot fully utilize the information contained in base kernels. Therefore, we introduce a novel local graph based on multiple kernel learning (LGMKL) in this paper. Specifically, LGMKL is constructed based on the optimal kernel which is automatically learned from base kernels with a nonlinear strategy and the information contained in different base kernels is also utilized in LGMKL. Then an iterative scheme with proven convergence is developed to optimize the objective function of LGMKL. Unlike most MKL-based graph learning methods, LGMKL focuses on the local structure of data. Finally, nine benchmark datasets and two synthetic datasets are adopted to test the performance of LGMKL. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed method.

DE Datasets; Deepfake; Localization; Detection
AB Most deepfake detection methods focus on detecting spatial and/or spatio-temporal changes in facial attributes and are centered around the binary classification task of detecting whether a video is real or fake. This is because available benchmark datasets contain mostly visual-only modifications present in the entirety of the video. However, a sophisticated deepfake may include small segments of audio or audio-visual manipulations that can completely change the meaning of the video content. To addresses this gap, we propose and benchmark a new dataset, Localized Audio Visual DeepFake (LAV-DF), consisting of strategic content-driven audio, visual and audio-visual manipulations. The proposed baseline method, Boundary Aware Temporal Forgery Detection (BA-TFD), is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network-based architecture which effectively captures multimodal manipulations. We further improve (i.e. BA-TFD+) the baseline method by replacing the backbone with a Multiscale Vision Transformer and guide the training process with contrastive, frame classification, boundary matching and multimodal boundary matching loss functions. The quantitative analysis demonstrates the superiority of BA-TFD+ on temporal forgery localization and deepfake detection tasks using several benchmark datasets including our newly proposed dataset. The dataset, models and code are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/LAV-DF.

AB Multi-robots can perform complex tasks such as exploration, foraging, and formation. Efficient communication between robots can contribute to the accomplishment of collective tasks through efficient message exchange. This paper proposes a strategy based on the message's propagation technique, Wave Swarm, for the formation task inspired by the Traveling Salesman Problem. The Wave Swarm communication approach uses the concept of wave propagation for message exchange between neighbors, establishing a Father and Son relationship between robots. However, different pairs of Father and Son robots can impact the simulation time, the average distance traveled by each robot, and the number of messages exchanged during the formation task. Thus, given a random distribution of robots into a swarm, we model the problem of assigning one position and route for each robot to achieve its place in the formation as a Traveling Salesman Problem. The routes resulting from the TSP solution establish a new parental relationship between the robots in the swarm. We performed preliminary experiments to define the technique used in the TSP resolution. We tested reinforcement learning and the genetic algorithm using the TSPLIB95 library. Thus, we develop a strategy for formation tasks based on Wave Swarm and TSP solved with reinforcement learning. We adopted the leader-follower approach in an unknown environment to validate the proposal. The results show the behavior of different sizes of robot groups for various desired shapes. Experiments with the robot simulator CoppeliaSim (V-REP) validate the proposed strategy and highlight its efficiency and robustness while running the formation task.

AB Zero-watermarking is a promising technology for image copyright protection due to its excellent imperceptibility and robustness. Compared with deep learning (DL)-based zero-watermarking schemes which are time-consuming and unable to respond in real-time, the moment-based zero-watermarking schemes do not have the aforementioned drawbacks and have drawn great attention with their strong description ability and geometric invariance. However, most existing moment-based zero-watermarking methods bear a number of drawbacks, in particular: (i) Direct computation of image moments is inefficient and inaccurate; (ii) They have difficulty obtaining the favorable trade-off between robustness and discriminability; (iii) Generating pseudo-random numbers based on traditional logistic map results in their lower security performance. To deal with those issues, this paper introduces a new image zero-watermarking method that relies on fast fractional-order polar linear canonical transform (FFrPLCT) features and asymmetric tent map. Firstly, we propose a novel computation strategy called fast polar linear Canonical transform (FPLCT), to save the calculation time of moments. Secondly, we define the fast fractional-order polar linear Canonical transform (FFrPLCT), which is characterized by the generic nature and time-frequency analysis capability. Thirdly, we present the FFrPLCT mixed low-order features by fully exploiting the time-frequency property of FFrPLCT, to improve both the robustness and discriminability of image representation. Finally, we develop a new image zero-watermarking method using FFrPLCT domain mixed low order features and asymmetric tent map. Experimental results and comparison with well-known existing methods demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of the proposed image zero-watermarking scheme.

AB Swarm robotics involves the study of the behavior of a set of robots in carrying out collective tasks, such as alignment, navigation and formation. During cooperative tasks execution, the communication among robots can contribute to successfully performing tasks through an efficient messages exchange. This paper proposes a communication strategy for swarm robots, the so-called Double-Wave Swarm, aiming at alignment and navigation tasks. The Double-Wave Swarm is an improvement of a prior Wave Swarm communication approach that uses the concept of wave propagation for message exchange between neighbors. Double-Wave Swarm provides better communication network connectivity when compared to the former approach. Experiments with the robot simulator CoppeliaSim (V-REP) validate the proposed communication and highlight its efficiency and robustness while running alignment and navigation tasks. Also, the Double-Wave Swarm proved to be superior during swarm formation navigation into environments with obstacles in different scenarios if compared with Wave Swarm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Point of Interest; Fair recommendation; User satisfaction; POI
   allocation; Over and under capacity
AB Point of Interest (POI) recommendations have primarily focused on maximising user satisfaction, while neglecting the needs of POIs and their operators. One such need is recommendation exposure, which can lead to envy among the POIs. Some POIs may be under-recommended, while others may be overrecommended, resulting in dissatisfaction for both staff and users due to long queues or overcrowding. Existing work has not addressed the trade-off between satisfying user preferences and being fair to POIs, which typically aim to operate at capacity. Therefore, we introduce the POI fair allocation problem to model this issue, taking into account both user satisfaction and POI exposure fairness. To address this problem, we propose a fair POI allocation technique that balances user satisfaction and POI capacity-based exposure simultaneously. Our proposed model utilises existing (transformer neural networks and attention LSTM model) personalised POI recommendation models that capture users' spatio-temporal influences and interests in POI visits. We then propose POI capacity-based allocation using the over-demand cut policy and under-demand add policy, which ensures POI exposure ratio and envy-freeness up to certain thresholds. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on five datasets containing real-life POI visits. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed model outperforms baselines in terms of user and POI-based evaluation metrics. To ensure reproducibility, we have publicly shared our source code at Codeocean.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a new training algorithm that can update the situation of layers' network, and therefore, connections, neurons, and firing rate of neurons based on FORCE (first-order reduced and controlled error) training algorithm. The Quantized Full FORCE algorithm (QFF) also updates the number of neurons and connections between different layers in the network per iteration in a way that the whole firing rate of each layer is updated via selecting the best neurons and combining strong features. The update method is sequential, so that with each instance passing through the network, the network structure is updated with the Full FORCE algorithm. The algorithm updates the structure of networks with a multiple/single middle layer of the supervised version of feed forward networks such as Multilayer perceptron (MLP), changing them into partially-connected networks. A combination of principal component analysis PCA and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) algorithms has been used to cluster the network input features. The paper focuses on the deep supervised MLP network with backpropagation (BP) and various datasets and its comparison with other MLP based stat of art methods and hybrid evolutionary algorithms. We achieved 98.15 percent accuracy for facial expression 98.6 and 97.7 percent for Wisconsin breast Cancer and Iris Flower in respectively. The training algorithm employed in the study enjoys a lower computational complexity while yielding faster and more accurate convergence, starting with a very low level of errors of 0.009 in comparison with the full connection network and it solves the challenge of getting stuck in local minima and poor convergence of Gradient Decent with BP.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In semiconductor manufacturing processes, spatial defect patterns on semiconductor wafers can provide useful information to quality engineers regarding the root causes of abnormalities. As early detection of process problems increases the wafer yield, the automatic recognition of defect patterns is crucial. It its intrinsic assumption that a decluttering of noise defects helps in accurately classifying defect patterns. However, most existing noise detection methods require the pre-determination of parameters that significantly affect the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a parameter free detection framework called BAND, which refers to BAgging Noise Detectors, to solve this problem. By adopting the framework of bootstrap aggregating (bagging), which combines the detection results from multiple outlier detection algorithms, the proposed framework ensures the diversity of randomly chosen parameter values while maintaining an accurate detection of noise defects. Based on the estimated distributions of outlierness scores, a group of outliers is discriminated from the other group of inliers via spectral clustering. This procedure enables the proposed framework to be parameter free. Moreover, numerical experiments based on synthetic and real-world datasets are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PREDICTION
AB Transfer learning is a machine learning paradigm where knowledge from one problem is utilized to solve a new but related problem. While conceivable that knowledge from one task could help solve a related task, if not executed properly, transfer learning algorithms can impair the learning performance instead of improving it - commonly known as negative transfer. In this paper, we use a parametric statistical model to study transfer learning from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically, we study three variants of transfer learning problems, instantaneous, online, and time-variant transfer learning. We define an appropriate objective function for each problem and provide either exact expressions or upper bounds on the learning performance using information-theoretic quantities, which allow simple and explicit characterizations when the sample size becomes large. Furthermore, examples show that the derived bounds are accurate even for small sample sizes. The obtained bounds give valuable insights into the effect of prior knowledge on transfer learning, at least with respect to our Bayesian formulation of the transfer learning problem. In particular, we formally characterize the conditions under which negative transfer occurs. Lastly, we devise several (online) transfer learning algorithms that are amenable to practical implementations, some of which do not require the parametric assumption. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms with real data sets, focusing primarily on when the source and target data have strong similarities.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

DE Fraud detection; Attention mechanism; Ensemble learning; Boosting
AB Transaction fraud detection is an essential topic in financial research, protecting customers and financial institutions from suffering significant financial losses. The existing ensemble learning-based fraud detection model improves the accuracy of distinguishing fraudulent transactions by integrating multiple base learners. However, their insufficient optimization of variance leads to the inadequate generalization of the model, which makes them unable to meet the requirements of detecting evolving fraudulent behavior. So, this paper proposes an attention-based boosting ensemble model (AM-Boost) for fraud detection that imparts diversity perturbation to the base learner from the feature dimension. Firstly, the feature-wise attention mechanism is proposed to help the model exploit the highly informative fraud features by learning distributed global feature space. And it is combined with boosting strategy to reduce the variance by lowering the correlation between base learners. Secondly, we propose a feature diversity regularization term in the integration stage to optimize the weighted majority voting strategy with a reasonable trade-off between bias and variance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on a public fraud detection dataset and a real-world transaction dataset. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline methods in both datasets.

AB This study focuses on the diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A novel approach inspired by the functioning of the brain is proposed, which uses the dynamics, frequency, and temporal content of EEGs to extract new discriminant features of the disease. The generated sparse dynamic features (SDFs) allow, through a transformation, to change the point of view on the data giving access to more informative features that are more faithful to the concept of EEG generation. Nevertheless, the method remains generic and can be applied to any signal but for this application it was evaluated on a publicly available dataset containing EEG signals recorded during a 3-oddball auditory task involving N = 50 subjects, of whom 25 suffer from PD. Given the adequate perspective on the data, it comes out that by using only two extracted features from the generated SDFs the healthy and unhealthy subjects are separated using a linear classifier. The classification yields an accuracy of 90.0% (p < 0.03) using a single channel. By aggregating the information from three channels and making them vote, an accuracy of 94%, a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 92% is obtained. The evaluation was carried out using a nested Leave-One-Out cross-validation procedure, thus preventing data leakage problems and giving a less biased evaluation. Several tests were carried out to assess the validity and robustness of our approach.

AB This paper proposes a novel chaotic heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization (CLPSO) method for the simultaneous size and shape design of structures. The heterogeneous CLPSO divides the particles into two explorative and exploitative subpopulations. The exploration performs the global searches for the set of best particles experienced solely within its own subpopulation, whilst the exploitation refines the deep searches learnt from the global best particle over an entire population. In essence, the proposed method maintains a good balance between the global explorative and local exploitative optimization schemes. The global searches within the explorative subpopulation are independent to the exploitative simulations even if the latter scheme prematurely converges to the local swarm position. For both subpopulations, the comprehensive learning approach constructs the particles through a cross-positioning process on the individual variable space and avoids the local optimal pitfall. Moreover, the chaotic logistic map within the exploitative optimization tests the global best particle through the set of diversely generated samples and hence enhances the local search ability. Various enriching techniques, including automatic adaptive (inertial weight and acceleration) parameters with dynamic space reduction, are incorporated to improve the likelihood of finding the optimal solution of practical-scale problems at modest computing efforts. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method are illustrated through a number of planar and spatial truss design benchmarks subjected to the challenging nonconvex and/or nonsmooth programs.

AB When performing learning tasks in pervasive environments, the main challenge arises from the need of combining federated and continual settings. The former comes from the massive distribution of devices with privacy-regulated data. The latter is required by the low resources of the participating devices, which may retain data for short periods of time. In this paper, we propose a setup for learning with Echo State Networks (ESNs) in pervasive environments. Our proposal focuses on the use of Intrinsic Plasticity (IP), a gradient-based method for adapting the reservoir's non-linearity. First, we extend the objective function of IP to include the uncertainty arising from the distribution of the data over space and time. Then, we propose Federated Intrinsic Plasticity (FedIP), which is intended for client-server federated topologies with stationary data, and adapts the learning scheme provided by Federated Averaging (FedAvg) to include the learning rule of IP. Finally, we further extend this algorithm for learning to Federated Continual Intrinsic Plasticity (FedCLIP) to equip clients with CL strategies for dealing with continuous data streams. We evaluate our approach on an incremental setup built upon real-world datasets from human monitoring, where we tune the complexity of the scenario in terms of the distribution of the data over space and time. Results show that both our algorithms improve the representation capabilities and the performance of the ESN, while being robust to catastrophic forgetting.

ID ADAPTATION
AB Video-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods concentrate on addressing domain shift and improving the robustness of video models. It can be naturally applied to cross-domain action recognition tasks, but the inherent complexity of videos makes this task more challenging. Though several recent attempts have achieved superior performance in the video UDA field, most of them intend to mitigate domain shift directly from the source domain to the target domain. These methods will cause a performance drop when the domain distribution shift is large. To better realize the domain adaptation, this paper proposes an effective gradual learning framework by constructing multiple auxiliary domains to achieve progressive transfer for cross-domain video action recognition. Specifically, a Dynamic CutMix Mechanism (DCM) is introduced to build the auxiliary domains that mitigate the domain gap caused by object distance and background discrepancies. Furthermore, the Gradual Transfer Strategy (GTS) utilizes these auxiliary domains to realize the cross-domain action classification gradually. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the experimental results can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark cross-domain datasets.

AB After generation units are connected to the power grid, electrical parameters such as generation unit output voltage, current and power need to be monitored for the safe and reliable function of grids. Obtaining accurate parameters of synchronous generation units (SGUs) is normally the basic requirement for grid stability analysis and control. To improve the accuracy of identifying SGU parameters, this study proposes graph attention-based U-Net conditional generative adversarial networks (GAUCGANs) for the identification of SGU parameters. The mapping between real and generated samples is modeled by applying conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs). The CGANs of the GAUCGANs proposed in this study consist of U-Nets-based generators, fully convolutional networks-based discriminators, and graph attention networks (GATs). The U-Nets of the GAUCGANs enhance the ability of generators to generate generative samples that are infinitely close to real samples. The U-Nets-based generators of the GAUCGANs are responsible for generating the SGU parameters; the fully convolutional networks-based discriminators of the GAUCGANs determine whether data is from the generator or the real data. In addition, the classification loss and sample labels are derived from the GATs. The addition of GATs will further enhance the ability of the generators to remove adversarial disturbances. In this study, the proposed GAUCGAN for parameter identification is compared with the traditional parameter identification algorithms. The comparison algorithms are applied to the Simulink standard SGU, hydroelectric unit No. 6 of the waterfall gorge hydropower plant, and the generation unit at the 18th bus of the IEEE 36-bus power system. The numerical simulation results from the GAUCGANs verify that the GAUCGAN can more accurately identify SGU parameters than the traditional parameter identification algorithms. The GAUCGANs improve the accuracy by at least 61.60% on average over the other methods by comparing the RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and SMAPE under three cases comprehensively.

AB This paper introduces an evolutionary model in the scope of automated machine learning. This model is in charge of learning hyper-heuristics that represent selection rules of the form if-then, such that given a dataset for a text classification problem, the hyper-heuristics select the best classification method to use with it, based on the data distribution of the dataset. The evolutionary model starts by building a set of hyper-heuristics using a series of meta-features extracted from a training group of datasets that represent their data distribution. Hyper-heuristics are then evolved using adapted crossover and mutation operators. During the evolution, each hyper-heuristic is evaluated on its performance to classify each dataset in the training group. When the evolutionary process is done, the best hyperheuristic is selected and evaluated for its generality with an independent test group of datasets. The results show that the best learned hyper-heuristic obtains an average classification performance close to the general optimum, and has a similar performance to the two most popular state-of-the-art automated machine learning systems, but with less computational cost. The approach used by the present model is relevant for automated machine learning in three aspects, the generality of the hyper -heuristics so they could be applied to groups of datasets; the interpretability of the representations that facilitate the understanding of the method selection by non-expert users; , the reduction of computational time and resources to reach a decision. Furthermore, the model extends the applicability of evolutionary computation methods, with their problem-independent properties and their ability to explore search spaces, to tackle new complex problems, such as the decision of the best classifier for a text classification dataset.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Transfer learning for collaborative recommendation with biased and

DT Article
DE Transfer learning; Collaborative recommendation; Bias reduction;
   Unbiased data
AB In a recommender system, a user's interaction is often biased by the items' displaying positions and popularity, as well as the user's self-selection. Most existing recommendation models are built using such a biased user-system interaction data alone. In this paper, we introduce an additional specially collected unbiased data, and then have a new problem called collaborative recommendation with biased and unbiased data. We first formalize the studied problem and list three challenges, including the bias challenge, the heterogeneity challenge and the unbalance challenge. Then we propose a novel transfer learning-based AI solution, i.e., transfer via joint reconstruction (TJR), to achieve knowledge transfer and sharing between the biased data and unbiased data. Specifically, in our TJR, we use two different models to extract the users' preferences and bias information, and then refine the prediction via the latent features containing the bias information in order to obtain a more accurate and unbiased recommendation. We further integrate the two data by reconstructing their interaction in a joint learning manner. Moreover, in order to better address the unbalance challenge, we introduce a bias regularization term and integrate bidirectional knowledge distillation. Finally, we adopt four representative methods, i.e., variational autoencoders, matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering and graph convolution network, as the backbone models of our TJR and conduct extensive empirical studies on three public datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of our transfer learning solution over some very competitive baselines. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Emotion is an instinctive state of mind created by the neurophysiological changes occurring in the human body as reactions to various internal or external stimuli. Emotions play a vital role in decision-making. The choices one makes in day-to-day life determine their behaviour and thus their character. Emotion and behaviour recognition are the key processes in ascertaining Emotional Intelligence (EQ) which is the inherent human potential to understand and manage one's own emotions in positive ways. But the process requires high expertise in the field of psychology and is exhaustive and time-consuming. This has opened a new horizon for exploring the computational recognition of EQ. Emotion Recognition (ER) is one of its sub-processes that identifies various human emotional states. Emotions are detected from physiological signals and also through non-invasive, visionbased algorithms by exploiting video and audio modalities. With the emergence of big data and state-of-art deep learning architectures combined with the vast availability of emotion-rich video content from various streaming platforms, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) which detects emotions through multiple and complementary input modalities from video has gathered momentum in recent years. This survey paper elaborately discusses the unimodal ER through visual, auditory, and linguistic modalities and reviews MER with combined features from these modalities. It also discusses the joint representations and fusion mechanisms used to acquire the intermodal correlations. Finally, we put forward the limitations and gaps identified in the literature along with a few suggestions for future work.

DE Generative Adversarial Networks; Evolutionary algorithm; Bi-level
   optimization; Decomposition; Parallel neuroevolution
AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are an adversarial approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, which have become one of the most relevant topics in the last years. Despite producing interesting outputs, recent studies have demonstrated that GANs remain difficult to control and suffer from training problems, such as instability and mode collapse, as well as several aspects of their models are designed by hand. Neuroevolution is a recent evolution strategy that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) in order to provide an automatic design of deep neural networks architectures. Many recent efforts have been dedicated to contributing on GANs by developing different single-level EAs approaches, however they could not solve their common issues completely which are still open problems. In this paper, we propose a new design of evolutionary algorithms in the context of GANs, consisting of dividing the evolution search space into two complementary levels, modeling a Bi-level Evolutionary Approach called Bi-EvoGAN searching to surpass their adversarial optimization difficulties and also to demonstrate the performance of considering two levels of optimization in comparison to a single optimization level. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first application of the bi-level optimization in the context of generative adversarial networks. The upper level uses an Evolutionary Algorithm-based Topology Optimization method named "EA-TO"to evolve a population of GAN networks as a set of individuals in order to find the best network topology. The lower level applies an Evolutionary Algorithm-based Decomposition for Hyperparameter Optimization termed "EA/D-HO"in order to select the best hyperparameters of each GAN individual. The performance of Bi-EvoGAN is explained by the double optimization of the GAN topology and their hyperparameters through the new bilevel optimization design allowing to evolve a GAN population in its higher fitness which will improve the quality of the search method and consequently to accelerate the convergence. Experimental studies are carried out based on four well-known benchmark datasets, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CelebA and LSUN-Bedroom allowing to show the efficiency of our approach in comparison to the other state-of-the-art approaches. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Gasification is one of the recommended processes for poultry litter valorization, and its success is largely dependent on process input parameters for syngas production. The quality of syngas, characterized by a higher heating value (HHV) and lower heating value (LHV), is significantly influenced by hydrogen. In this research, integration of Aspen Plus simulation and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have been done to estimate the hydrogen content in syngas. The gasification process has been optimized using the response surface method, and the results have been supported by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The statistical analysis of the response surface model revealed that the optimal process parameters are around 408 degrees C, 2.0 (biomass to air ratio) BMR, and 2.0 bars. Interestingly, PSO led to nearly identical optimum values (400 degrees C, 2.0 BMR, and 2.0 bars), resulting in high-quality syngas. Furthermore, CNN exhibited a good predicting performance with a coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.96, coupled with mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.01 and 0.05, respectively. This solidifies the integration of Aspen Plus simulations and CNN as an accurate surrogate model for predicting hydrogen levels during poultry litter gasification, enabling effective process optimization. Therefore, the proposed model serves as a reliable tool for predicting and optimizing the syngas produced during the gasification process of poultry litter, with potential applications in enhancing energy production and waste management practices.

AB Anomaly detection in the execution of business processes in the organizations has a high level of complexity due to the consideration of various process perspectives and their constraints, business rules, privacy policies, and regulations. Furthermore, only detection of anomalies is not sufficient. There is a crucial need for the results of anomaly detection to be explainable and interpretable, enabling users to adapt the decision making process and handle the detected anomalies. The work presented in this paper aims to provide business process owners with human-interpretable explanations for patterns of deviations found between process models and event data recorded during the execution of business processes, while traditional conformance checking methods only report low-level deviations found.First, by introducing an automated approach for multi-perspective conformance checking and anomaly detection in business process executions, we extract expected and unexpected behavior from event logs and identify patterns in deviations. Finally, by focusing on identifying the context involved in patterns of unexpected behavior, our approach facilitates the interpretations of detected patterns. The approach has been implemented in the open source ProM framework and its applicability is evaluated through a real-life dataset from a financial organization. The experiment not only shows that we can automatically detect more complex anomalies such as spurious data processing and misusage of authorizations, but also that we can explain these deviations in context.

AB Stock Price Movement Prediction (SPMP) task tends to predict the future price fluctuation of some stocks, which is challenging because of the volatile nature of financial markets. Recent researches widely introduce Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and achieve some competitive performances for SPMP. However, their works usually only extract the signal representations of individual stock in the phase of feature extraction whereas they ignore the real-time interactions among companies along the signal channels. In addition, when the financial relations among different entities (i.e., companies and executives) participate in the aggregation of GCN during feature encoding, the recent advances fail to consider the dynamics of the relation type representations and the iterative update between entities and relations. To address this problem, we propose a novel method consisting of an External Attention (EA) module and a Relation Type guided Graph Convolutional Network (RTGCN) for SPMP. In detail, to achieve the real-time interactions among companies along the signal channels, we introduce an external attention mechanism to share the company memory of the price and sentiment signals. Moreover, the proposed RTGCN considers the dynamics of the relation type embeddings and achieves iterative update between entity nodes and relation edges in the graph. The experiments on two open-source datasets (i.e., CSI100E and CSI300E) demonstrate that the proposed SPMP method can achieve state-of-the-art performances and can assuredly bring benefits for the performance improvement of SPMP.

AB This paper researches the adaptive bipartite output containment problem, for a signed graph of heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMASs). The dynamics of leaders are subject to unknown but bounded inputs, which cannot be measured by followers. Therefore, an containment control protocol based on distributed observer is proposed. An adaptive state and an output feedback algorithm are designed to ensure that cooperative and antagonistic agents enter different convex hull. Then, based on the output regulation approach, Lyapunov stability analysis and some other methods, the bipartite output containment control is realized. Finally, we validate the analytical results by numerical simulations.

AB In dark underwater areas, existing single-model underwater image enhancement methods have poor enhance-ment effects. We propose an underwater image enhancement method based on color correction and multi-scale fusion (CCMF). Specifically, we first design a color correction method with red channel compensation, which compensates for the red channel according to light attenuation and removes color bias. We propose a contrast enhancement method based on guided filtering to enhance edge texture details. The image is decomposed into a base layer and a detail layer in the logarithmic domain, with layered enhancement. Secondly, we propose an adaptive gamma correction method that dynamically adjusts correction parameters based on the gray image values. This approach prevents over-enhancement and effectively enhances the exposure in dark areas. We extract weight maps that represent different features from the input images and employ a multi-scale pyramid fusion technique to integrate the aforementioned feature information. This approach enables the mutual complementarity of various features and enhances the overall visual effect. Experimental results show that our method can effectively integrate the advantages of different enhancement methods, and the objective indicators of UCIQE, UIQM, and EG are better than other related state-of-the-art methods.

ID DECISION-ANALYSIS; BODIES; BASE
AB Evidential reasoning rule (ER rule), benefits by the advantage in dealing with various uncertainties, is widely applied for independent evidence aggregation and multi-attribute decision making. In engineering practice, however, time-lagged correlations among multiple attributes from complex systems are often encountered, causing time-lagged dependencies among evidences generated from these attributes. To aggregate multiple pieces of time-lagged dependent evidence, an evidential reasoning rule with time-lagged dependencies, called the ER-TLD, is developed in this paper. Firstly, the calculation algorithm for the relative total time-lagged dependence coefficient (RT-TLDC) and the delay time of each attribute is proposed based on the distance correlation (dCor) method, with which nonlinear time-lagged correlations among multiple attributes can be captured. On this basis, the ER-TLD model is constructed by introducing the RT-TLDCs and delay times into the ER rule, so that multiple pieces of time-lagged dependent evidence can be effectively aggregated. Then, sensitivity analyses are conducted, and the impact of delay time change on the aggregation results is explored. Finally, the effectiveness and potential application of the proposed method are verified by one numerical example and three practical experiments. The aggregation results obtained by the ER-TLD show more rationality according to the comparative studies.

AB Face image super-resolution (FSR) is a subtask of image super-resolution that aims to enhance the resolution of facial images. Previous FSR methods have leveraged facial prior information, such as parsing maps and landmarks, to improve their performance. However, these methods have not fully utilized the potential of this prior information, as they typically use the same network structure for different types of facial information. To address this limitation, we propose a new network structure called GAMFSR, which incorporates parsing map prior information and includes a global attention module (GAM) to improve the utilization of the parsing map. Additionally, we developed a multistage super-resolution network for preprocessing, which further improves the prediction accuracy. We conducted ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of GAM and the impact of different prior information. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the guidance of parsing map features and achieves better performance with less prior information.

AB Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram signals has been widely studied in the last decade, achieving artificial intelligence models that accurately classify primitive or primary emotions. However, most of these models focus on signal processing methods to better recognize multiclass targets, ignoring efficient denoising methods to reduce artifacts in input samples. Therefore, this study proposes two-dimension reduction algorithms derived from machine learning models based on electroencephalogram channel selection and conflict learning. The last two approaches exploit the electroencephalogram signals from the SEED-V dataset as input data. Next, a wavelet noise-estimate frequency decomposition and a 1-D Local Binary Pattern (LBP) are applied to achieve a histogram per signal. After applying a feature extraction method, the targets per sample are adapted to yield the most relevant electroencephalogram channels and obtain a highly competitive machine-learning model that uses only the FCZ and CP4 electrodes. Additionally, relevant findings based on conflict learning yield that samples with "Happy" and "Disgust" targets had numerous artifacts compared with the other studied emotions ("Fear", "Sad", and "Neutral) but achieved superior performance than the channel selection method. The proposed framework reached accuracy rates per dimension reduction near 90% accuracy and between 87% and 92.8% using the F1-score metric. Hence, the classification results are highly competitive with state-of-the-art close-related methods.

AB The energy efficiency of CNN-based inference engines predominately depends upon Giga-operations-per-second and power consumption. The sparse-based accelerator compresses the insignificant inputs (input feature maps & weights), skips the inefficient computations, and improves energy efficiency. A sparse accelerator for weights could impact the accuracy of the inference. Therefore, a sparse network for Input Feature Maps (IFMs) is considered. MATLAB-based sparsity analysis is done layer-wise on the pre-trained CNN models like AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-18 & ResNet-34. Layer-wise analysis reveals that similar to 18%-90% of the IFMs are zeros. Besides, IFMs and Weights adopted the 16-bit Fix/Float data format to maintain an accuracy as close as 97% with Single Precision Floating Point (SPFP). A 3 x 1 Convolutional array with improved Zero-detect-Skip (CZS(3x1)) control units for multiplier and adder/subtractor arrays is proposed. The modified rectified linear unit (RELU) converts IFM values <= 0 to zero and sets Detection-Bit (DB) to 1. These DBs decide the mode of effective zero-skip operations in CZS(3x1). A 3 x 3 Compressed Processing Element (CPE) is designed using three CZS(3x1). The 20-CPEs convolution array architecture is implemented in 65 nm technology libraries. The performance of 90 Giga-operations per second (GOP/s) and energy efficiency of 3.42 Tera operations per second per watt (TOPS/W) were attained for the proposed CPE. The CPE with improved control strategy enhanced the performance by a factor of 2.45 while consuming 8.8 times less energy on average than the state-of-the-art CNN accelerators.

AB This paper addresses the problem of frequently mixed loading in the waste collection and transportation process, which leads to degradation of the waste classification effect. A supervision method based on a cascaded detector combined with ResNet18 and YOLOv5 for waste collection and transportation is proposed. First, the improved YOLOv5s is used to identify the location and states of the garbage cans. By replacing batch normalization in the backbone with representative batch normalization, the specific features are enhanced with a simple and effective feature calibration scheme and produce a more stable feature distribution. Introducing CBAM into the CSP module of YOLOv5 helps the network pay more attention to special regions. The Ghost convolution effectively reduces the number of parameters and faster the speed without affecting the performance of the model. Moreover, the classifier, improved ResNet-18, classifies the color of garbage cans detected by YOLOv5. SE-Net is added at the beginning of the residual structure, and ResNet-D structure is used to improve the accuracy of the network at the same time. Finally, a database for waste classification and collection supervision is constructed based on the images provided by the relevant city department. Then, a series of experiments are performed on the database. The experimental results show that the improved YOLOv5 network reaches an mAP of 98.0%, the accuracy of the improved ResNet18 reaches 98.4% and the accuracy of the cascaded detector reaches 90.93% with a speed of 43.2 ms/it, which meets the requirements for urban garbage collection and transportation supervision.

AB Since the outbreak of COVID-19, in order to reduce people's contact, the takeaway business has been developed rapidly, bringing a large demand for disposable and degradable tableware (e.g., wooden spoon). However, in the production process of wooden spoon, the selection of crack spoons still relies on manual labour. Therefore, in order to detect cracked wooden spoons more effectively and reduce production costs, we propose a wooden spoon crack detection method by using machine vision techniques and apply it in real-world industrial factory. In the production system, the captured color of crack regions is black while the good region shows normal log color. The positions of crack regions are located frequently in the central or marginal areas of spoons and their directions of cracks are often same due to the extrusion of the mold in the production process. Based on these two types of prior knowledge (i.e., color and spatial prior information), three modules are designed to explore these priors by jointly integrating with the current mainstream detection network of YOLO-v5, which satisfies the speed and accuracy for detecting cracks. The color fusion module is designed to explore the color difference between good regions and crack regions. The attention and orientation modules are then combined and embedded into the backbone of deep architecture. Reported experiments on our collected database show that our proposed detection method can locate the spoon cracks very well and significantly outperforms the model of YOLO-v5 with the protocols of Recall, Precision and meanAueragePrecision(mAP).

AB Weakly supervised salient object detection (SOD) is a challenging task and has drawn much attention from several research perspectives, it has revealed two problems while driving the rapid development of saliency detection. specialIntscript Large divergence in the characteristics of saliency regions in terms of location, shape and size makes them difficult to recognize. specialIntscript The properties of convolutional neural networks dictate that it is insensitive to various transformations, which will lead to hardly balance the application of various disturbances. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel seminar learning framework with consistent transformation ensembling (SLF-CT) for scribble supervised SOD. The framework consists of the teacher-student model and the student-student model for segmenting the salient objects. Specifically, we first design a cross attention guided network (CAGNet) as a baseline model for saliency prediction. Then we assign CAGNet to the teacher-student model, where the teacher network is based on the exponential moving average and guides the training of the student network. Moreover, we adopt multiple pseudo labels to transfer the information among students from different conditions. To further enhance the regularization of the network, a consistency transformation mechanism is also incorporated, which encourages the saliency prediction and input image of the network to be consistent. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs favorably comparable with the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods. As far as we know, the proposed approach is the first application of seminar learning in the SOD area.

AB Welding is widely used in metal components. The firm of weld components is very important in different applications, such as buildings, bridges, cars and airplanes, etc. Weld seam quality inspection is essential to ensure product quality. The area and shape of the weld seam are the basis for quality assessment. So the segmentation of the weld area is very important for quality assessment. To address the problem of segmentation of the weld seam region, a weld seam segmentation network based on heat map detail guidance with Matting is proposed in this paper, which provides a new idea for fine-grained segmentation of the weld seam region. The existing DCNN-based semantic segmentation algorithm model has a poor segmentation effect at the boundary and jagged segmentation boundary, which are unacceptable for the weld segmentation problem that requires clear and precise boundary positioning. To solve this problem, three innovations are made in this paper on the DCNN-based semantic segmentation network. (1) A heat map detail guidance module makes the segmentation boundary information focus on shallow features and enhances the representation of boundary information. (2) A segmentation head improvement method for fine-grained semantic segmentation is proposed. (3) In response to the loss of process details in the coding and decoding of the semantic segmentation network, resulting in poor segmentation boundary accuracy, this paper introduces a matting algorithm to calibrate the boundary of the weld seam segmentation region. Through many experiments on industrial weld data sets, the effectiveness of our method is demonstrated, and the MIoU (Mean Intersection over Union) reaches 96.32%. It is worth noting that this performance is comparable to human manual segmentation ( MIoU 96.38%).

AB Since the propagation of deep neural networks results in the loss of detailed feature information, the performance of most object detection methods is limited due to their tendency to learn regional features in visual space while neglecting relationships between objects. Therefore, this study proposes the Graph Relational Decision Network (GRDN), which mines relationships between objects in a dataset. The GRDN consists of a graph decision network, decision coefficient, and step-wise relation deduction module. The graph decision network comprises an edge decision network, and a node decision network, wherein a data-driven technique is employed to obtain implicit relationships between labels in a dataset. These relationships are expressed through an adaptive dynamic graph, which is subsequently recoded by means of the decision coefficient, which can enhance semantic information. In the step-wise relation deduction module, semantic information is employed as a guide to prevent distraction. A series of experiments were conducted on the MS COCO dataset. The proposed method achieves 52.8% box AP on object detection, which is 2.3% box AP higher than Cascade Mask R-CNN. The experimental results show that the addition of dynamic semantic information in this study can make up for the loss of detailed information and focus on key information, thereby improving the detection ability of small objects and occluded objects. In summary, this study extracts inter-object relationships to obtain more complete semantic information, which enriches the research of object detection.

AB In this article, we propose and study a general framework for comparing and evaluating soft clusterings, viewed as a form of uncertainty quantification for clustering tasks, with the aim of studying the uncertainty that arises from such a comparison. Our proposal is based on the interpretation of soft clustering as describing uncertain information, represented in the form of a mass function, about an unknown, target hard clustering. We present a general construction to this purpose, called distributional measures, whereby any evaluation measure can be naturally extended to soft clustering. We study the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, both in terms of computational complexity and metric properties. Furthermore, we study its relationship with other existing proposals providing, in particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence between distributional measures and the recently proposed framework of transport-theoretic measures. We also propose sampling-based approximation algorithms with convergence guarantees, making it possible to apply the proposed method to real-world datasets. Finally, we apply the distributional measures in a computational experiment in order to illustrate their usefulness.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   learning task
AB Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) has been challenging due to the existence of large discrepan-cies between visible and infrared modalities. Most pioneering approaches reduce intra-modality variations and inter-modality discrepancies by learning modality-shared features. However, an explicit modality-shared cue, i.e., body keypoints, has not been fully exploited in VI-ReID. Additionally, existing feature learning paradigms imposed constraints on either global features or partitioned feature stripes, which neglect the prediction consistency of global and part features. To address the above problems, we exploit Pose Estimation as an auxiliary learning task to assist VI-ReID in an end-to-end framework. By jointly training these two tasks in a mutually beneficial manner, our model learns higher quality ID-related features. On top of it, the learnings of global features and local features are seamlessly synchronized by Hierarchical Feature Constraint (HFC), where the former supervises the latter using the knowledge distillation strategy. Experimental results on two benchmark VI-ReID datasets show that the proposed method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods by significant margins. Specifically, our method achieves nearly 20% mAP improvements against the state-of-the-art method on the RegDB dataset. Our intriguing findings highlight the usage of auxiliary task learning in VI-ReID. Our source code is available at https://github.com/yoqim/Pose_VIReID.

AB Deep learning is typically performed by learning a neural network solely from data in the form of input-output pairs ignoring available domain knowledge. In this work, the Constraint Guided Gradient Descent (CGGD) framework is proposed that enables the injection of domain knowledge into the training procedure. The domain knowledge is assumed to be described as a conjunction of hard inequality constraints which appears to be a natural choice for several applications. Compared to other neuro-symbolic approaches, the proposed method converges to a point that makes an arbitrarily small error with respect to any inequality constraint on the training data and does not require to first transform the constraints into some ad-hoc term that is added to the learning (optimization) objective. It is empirically shown on four independent and small data sets that CGGD makes training less dependent on the initialization of the network, improves the constraint satisfiability on all data, improves the generalization of the model to unseen data, and relaxes the need for annotated data. Moreover, the method is tested for a regression and a semantic segmentation task.

AB In order to improve the trajectory tracking accuracy and robustness of a typical heavy electro-hydraulic position system, a fuzzy adaptive sliding mode controller is proposed. A potential-like function is introduced to design a new sliding surface with non-linear integral term. An adaptive controller is designed to approximate the equivalent controller in sliding mode control. Stability of the controller is demonstrated by Lyapunov method, and the chattering phenomenon caused by the nonlinear switching term is reduced by using the fuzzy switching method, 25 fuzzy rules are given to adjust the sliding mode switching controller. Simulations with sinusoidal, ramp and step signals, and experiments with leveling operation at different speeds are carried out. The proposed controller can follow the reference trajectory quickly and smoothly, and has certain anti-interference ability. Compared with the traditional sliding mode controller, the proposed controller has small tracking error, fast response and good tracking performances.

AB Hydraulic retarder and eddy current retarder are important auxiliary braking component, which installed on heavy-duty vehicles. However, the hydraulic retarder has poor braking performance at low speeds, while the eddy-current retarder presents serious thermal recession at high speed. To overcome these issues and ensure safe driving during downhill conditions, a novel Integrated Electromagnetic and Hydraulic Retarder (IEHR) is pro-posed. The design includes a rotor with blades, double salient poles, and a coil built in a C-type stator. The electromagnetic field model of the IEHR is established and analyzed using the Finite Element Method. Moreover, the nonlinear eddy viscosity model of the flow field is generated and analyzed using the Computational Fluid Dynamics. The Blend braking control strategy is adopted to distribute the braking torque at high speed and low speed The IEHR performance was tested at a test bench. The test results show that the calculated braking characteristics of the electromagnetic and hydraulic subsystems were reasonable agreement with the measured results. The road test was carried out on a vehicle with a total mass of 49 tons. The deceleration and torque peaked at 0.75 m/s2 and 3620 N m, respectively. These results indicated that the IEHR has better performance than conventional hydraulic retarders and eddy current retarder, and is more suitable for heavy vehicles.

TI Meta pseudo labels for anomaly detection via partially observed

SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DE Anomaly detection; Semi-supervised learning; Meta pseudo-label
AB General anomaly detection has been an important research due to its broad and significant applications. Those algorithms that are based on weakly supervised or partially observed anomalies have attracted particular interest currently. However, most such algorithms treat the unlabeled set as a substitute for normal samples and ignore the potential anomalies in it, which on the one hand causes the noise of the normal set, and on the other hand, fails make full use of the abnormal supervision information. To address this issue, we propose a meta-pseudo-label based framework for anomaly detection (MPAD). The framework strives to obtain effective pseudo anomalies from the unlabeled samples to supplement the observed anomaly set. Specifically, a teacher network is improved based on the feedback of a student network on a validation set, thereby generating more conducive pseudo anomalies to assist the student network while incurring less confirmation bias. In addition, we also design a model roll-back scheme to guarantee the performance of the student network. Extensive experiments show that the proposed MPAD algorithm outperforms current popular algorithms on five real datasets, and the framework can effectively improve the utilization of unlabeled samples while maintaining an advanced degree of robustness. In addition, the results of ablation experiments confirm the effectiveness of each module of our MPAD. Parameter experiments provide sufficient reference for parameter selecting.

SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DE Point cloud semantic segmentation; Feature sampling; Cross-boundary
   learning; Multi-scale feature fusion
AB Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation presents a crucial yet challenging task. Current point cloud analysis approaches typically partition data into volumetric blocks, independently assigning labels to each point within these blocks. However, this strategy often compromises segmentation accuracy at block boundaries due to the isolated processing of each block, thus hindering the model's contextual understanding. To address this issue, we present CBFLNet, an innovative semantic segmentation model that enables offset-free feature upsampling and cross-boundary feature learning. CBFLNet facilitates interaction between adjacent blocks, extending its receptive field beyond the input block. As a result, it notably mitigates errors in block boundary segmentation. CBFLNet is composed of three modules: an explicit local representation module, a symmetric sampling module, and a cross-boundary feature fusion module. The explicit local representation module is a plug-and-play module that takes two overlapping point cloud blocks as input to construct an approximate local spatial representation. In the symmetric sampling module, point features are symmetrically downsampled and upsampled, effectively avoiding feature offset caused by interpolation. Lastly, the cross-boundary feature fusion module enables cross-boundary local feature learning and multi-scale feature fusion. CBFLNet demonstrates a significant performance improvement, achieving a 0.9% mIoU increase over state-of-the-art methods on the S3DIS dataset and exhibiting competitive performance on the ScannetV2 dataset.

AB Early group activity recognition is typically conducted in a 2D scenario. This paper proposes a group activity recognition method in a 3D space. In practical applications, differences in camera angle and mutual shielding during the peak flow of people will affect the extraction of individual characteristics and the calculation of individual relationships. Therefore, a method using 3D relationships is proposed. We first detect the 3D backbone of pedestrians and calculate the movement relationship of individuals in the group based on it. Second, we calculate the 3D-unified spatial-temporal graphs (3D-USTG) of the group and the individuals in the group using global-G3D (G-G3D). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively solve the problems caused by occlusion and shooting angle compared with a 2D method, which indicates that the proposed method can achieve better results when applied to intersections of different specifications. Additionally, the proposed method achieves strong performance metrics with two publicly available datasets for group activity recognition.

AB Image forgery is the intentional alteration of digital images, either manually using image editors or through deep fake techniques, for the purpose of disseminating fake information. We propose a forgery detection approach that efficiently detects copy-move and splicing attacks of varying scales in digital images. Our goal is to identify the homogeneous region(s) inconsistent with the rest of the image. This region property has been typically employed in object detection and classification, while we exploit this property to detect forgery in images. Thus, we generate the deep-derived features from the existing hand-crafted features in forgery detection as input to the VGG16, a deep learning method, trained for object classification. We use a binary class SVM trained on the obtained deep-derived features to determine whether an image is real or fake. We perform extensive experiments on three publicly available image manipulation datasets, DVMM, Casia and Korus to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show a better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Video prediction; Multiple scale; LSTM
AB The drastic variation of motion in spatial and temporal dimensions makes the video prediction task extremely challenging. Existing RNN models obtain higher performance by deepening or widening the model. They obtain the multi-scale features of the video only by stacking layers, which is inefficient and brings unbearable training costs (such as memory, FLOPs, and training time). Different from them, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal multi-scale model called MS-LSTM wholly from a multi-scale perspective. On the basis of stacked layers, MS-LSTM incorporates two additional efficient multi -scale designs to fully capture spatiotemporal context information. Concretely, we employ LSTMs with mirrored pyramid structures to construct spatial multi-scale representations and LSTMs with different convolution kernels to construct temporal multi-scale representations. We theoretically analyze the training cost and performance of MS-LSTM and its components. Detailed comparison experiments with twelve baseline models on four video datasets show that MS-LSTM has better performance but lower training costs. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Perceiving the future trend of Vessel Traffic Flow (VTF) in advance has great application values in the maritime industry. However, using such big data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) for accurate VTF prediction remains challenging. Deep training networks can learn valuable features from extensive historical data. This paper proposes a new learning-based prediction network, improved Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with similarity grouping, including three views. To effectively enable the training network to capture the temporal and periodic (i.e. a spatial attribute) change characteristics of VTF, the CNN and LSTM are employed to compose spatial and temporal views, respectively. Hence, the original onedimensional data is transformed into a matrix (hour of the day ✕ day) to adapt the input of the proposed methodology. In practical applications, VTF of multiple adjacent target regions need to be predicted simultaneously, and the changes of VTF in different areas may influence each other. To explore their hidden relationships, the similarity grouping view aims to find the target area that exhibits the most similarity with the VTF change trend of the current research area. Furthermore, similar information is combined with the features generated from the other two views to obtain the prediction results. In summary, the new advantage lies in mining the spatiotemporal attributes of data and fusing the similarity information of adjacent regions. Comparative experiments with eleven other methods on realistic VTF datasets show that the proposed method demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and stability performance.

AB In the field of histopathology, the microtomy procedure yields thin sections of tissue embedded in paraffin blocks, then to be further processed for diagnostic purposes. Within microtomy, trimming is an initial but critical process in which the excess paraffin covering the tissue of interest is removed by continuous cutting routines, until the tissue is suitably exposed and ready for sectioning. Trimming is currently a time-consuming process that is manually held by technicians. In this paper, we present a method to automatize this process, by analyzing tissue block surface images resulting from each cyclic cutting routine. Two types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were fine-tuned: one for binary segmentation, the other for multi-class classification tasks, by exploring and optimizing lightweight architectures to provide fast analytical results on cost-effective edge computing. Two sequential online conditions followed the CNNs to output the current stage of the block surface and rule if the trimming-end cutting routine was reached. We compared the results obtained through our method with the ones obtained by three skilled technicians processing 75 tissue blocks. The proposed method identified the trimming-end cutting routine approximately as accurate as the technicians did, yielding up to 90% of trimmed blocks of optimal quality and evidencing the potential of this tool in future automated trimming instruments. We deployed our method to an Edge TPU hardware accelerator to showcase its capability to provide immediate and objective results at every microtomy station applied with an ad hoc hardware, potentially guaranteeing a throughput 50% higher than manual trimming.

AB In this paper, an optimized backpropagation neural network (BPNN) prediction models have been proposed to estimate the concentration of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanomaterials required for the removal of Acid Black 24 dye, a type of textile dye, from industrial wastewater. The research gap addressed in this study lies in the investigation of various optimization algorithms for BPNN models and their profound impact on the accuracy of nanomaterial concentration predictions, thus contributing to the advancement of nanotechnology-based wastewater treatment research and its practical applications in industrial settings. Although several studies have predicted the amount of nanomaterial needed to degrade the dyes in industrial wastewater using BPNN, few have investigated the effects of optimized BPNN and how greatly the amount of degradation can vary. Therefore, six different optimization algorithms, including genetic algorithms (GAs), ant colony optimization (ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), evaluation strategy (ES), biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and population-based incremental learning algorithm (PBIL), are applied to optimize and evaluate the BPNN models. Experimental data obtained from chemical laboratory experiments are used to train and test the models, with different experiments conducted for various factors like TiO2, H2SO4, NaIO4, K2S2O8, dye, and silver nitrate. The performance of the optimized BPNN models is assessed using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root means squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models, with ACO yielding the best outcomes across all models. The R2 values for the TiO2, H2SO4, NaIO4, and K2S2O8 models after optimization indicate perfect predictions, whereas the R2 values before optimization ranged from 0.888 to 0.984. PSO performs well for most models except for K2S2O8, GA improves most models except for the silver nitrate model, ES enhances only the Dye model, and PBIL does not affect the TiO2 model. Overall, the optimized BPNN models exhibit impressive accuracy in estimating the TiO2 concentration required for removing Acid Black 24 dye from industrial wastewater.

AB Optical imaging of fast and transient phenomena such as the turbulent breakup of liquid sprays exhibit low signal-to-noise ratios due to the limited illumination intensity relative to the short exposure time. Image denoising is required to facilitate physical studies over these data but is challenging due to the absence of clean ground-truths and the stringency of the denoising task (e.g., strong and complex noise, limited resolution, preserving physical fidelity), preventing supervised and existing un-/self-supervised deep learning methods. To this end, Sequence2Self (Seq2S) is proposed, an extension of Self2Self (S2S) to image sequences that leverages both the signal's spatial and temporal correlation. Seq2S is demonstrated on time-resolved x-ray phase contrast imaging of liquid jet fuel sprays in a gas turbine combustor, which possesses all of challenges detailed above. Experiments are conducted across four fuels with different breakup morphology using various state-of-the-art methods. Overall, many of the methods failed and Seq2S was most successful: (1) Accurate spray structures were reconstructed with consistent evolution across frames void of artifacts. (2) The performance was robust, invariant to the hyperparameter choice. (3) Computational time is short and can be made eligible for real-time denoising. In particular, the images denoised by Seq2S showed spray droplet diameter distributions with near zero Kullback-Leibler divergence (0.01 & PLUSMN; 0.01) to a cleaner reference, whereas the second best method yielded 0.06 & PLUSMN; 0.03. This suggests that Seq2S can be reliably used prior to subsequent quantitative spray analyses as it retains (if not, improves) the statistical physical properties of the data.

AB Classic Delphi and Fuzzy Delphi methods are used to test content validity of data collection tools such as questionnaires. Fuzzy Delphi takes the opinion issued by judges from a linguistic perspective reducing ambiguity in opinions by using fuzzy numbers. We propose an extension named 2-Tuple Fuzzy Linguistic Delphi method to deal with scenarios in which judges show different expertise degrees by using fuzzy multigranular semantics of the linguistic terms and to obtain intermediate and final results expressed by 2-tuple linguistic values. The key idea of our proposal is to validate the full questionnaire by means of the evaluation of its parts, defining the validity of each item as a Decision Making problem. Taking the opinion of experts, we measure the degree of consensus, the degree of consistency, and the linguistic score of each item, in order to detect those items that affect, positively or negatively, the quality of the instrument. Considering the real need to evaluate a b-learning educational experience with a consensual questionnaire, we present a Decision Making model for questionnaire validation that solves it. Additionally, we contribute to this consensus reaching problem by developing an online tool under GPL v3 license. The software visualizes the collective valuations for each iteration and assists to determine which parts of the questionnaire should be modified to reach a consensual solution.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) constitutes a demanding research field that integrates artificial intelligence, informatics, robotics, engineering, and human-machine interaction. In the present era, there is an increased focus on natural user interfaces, with particular attention to gestural modalities. This leads to the coordination of modern robotic systems, where real-time integration and interpretation of manual gestures play a vital role in facilitating effective manipulation. Hand gesture recognition holds a crucial role in the field of machine vision, perhaps greatly exacerbated with varying lighting conditions and backgrounds. In this paper, first an Enhanced Anchor-free Network (EAF-Net) is proposed to perform hand gesture recognition in real-time. The EAF-Net is deep single-stage Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture. The Custom Precise Prediction Function (CPPF) is utilized for a continuous recognition of a specific gesture from a video feed. Then, the 6-axis collaborative Robot is manipulated using the predicted gesture. The EAF-Net model utilizes the Enriched Hourglass as a backbone feature extraction network. The proposed EAF-Net model undergoes training and assessment using the MITI HD-II dataset. The performance of the model is also analyzed for the standard benchmark datasets (NUSHP-II and Senz-3D). The evaluation of the EAF-Net model's performance spans a range of IoU values from 0.5 to 0.95. The EAF-Net model led to higher precision values (AP0.5) as 99.22%, recall values (AR0.5) as 98.20%, and F1-Score0.5 as 98.64% on the MITI HD-II dataset. The EAF-Net model consumed a prediction time of 259 ms on NVIDIA Jetson Nano Processor and 14 ms on NVIDIA Titan X GPU. It aided in implementing a portable high-speed 6-axis Robot control framework to pick and place operation in 3D space. The robot would be able to imitate human hand activities such as hand rotation, hand tilting, picking and arranging items, and so on in the near future. Further reduction in prediction time of the model on the portable processors (NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry-Pi) could enhance the speed of the Human Machine Interaction process.

AB Current vision-based displacement measurement methods have limitations of requiring manual target and parameter adjustment, along with significant user involvement to achieve the desired results. This paper proposes an advanced and comprehensive vision system based on ZED cameras for full-field three-dimensional (3D) vibration displacement measurement of civil structures. Compared to existing binocular systems consisting of multiple monoculars, ZED binoculars offer greater flexibility on instrument setup and data acquisition. A novel keypoint detection and matching algorithm based on deep learning is used to achieve target-free measurement, which is capable of capturing feature points with high precision. The performance of the proposed vision-based approach is evaluated through experimental studies on a six-story scaled frame structure. Statistical analysis of the comparative results in sinusoidal cases demonstrates that the displacement responses obtained from the proposed vision-based approach show consistent results in compliance with displacement sensor measurements. System identification of the target structure is achieved through a seismic case and the error analysis is also concluded in detail.

AB Neuromorphic electronics have great potential in the emulation of the sensory, cognitive, self-learning, and actuating functions of robots. While typically implemented in rigid silicon, emerging technologies in organic and flexible electronic materials have also led to tremendous advances in the development of neuromorphic perception systems. However, a comprehensive review of the contribution/role of organic neuromorphic electronics for robotic applications is still missing. This review presents advancements in silicon-based and organic neuromorphic electronics for intelligent robot development, focusing on perception, navigation, and learning-based control. Organic synaptic devices, along with dynamic vision sensors, enable diverse forms of sensory-enabled computational perception, offering tunability, stability, low power consumption, and confor-mal substrates. Integration of simultaneous localization and mapping techniques and path planning algorithms empowers robots to efficiently navigate, build accurate maps, and make informed decisions. Different learning algorithms and their hardware implementations in neuromorphic robotic control are explored, enabling robots to learn and adapt to dynamic environments. The review highlights the potential of neuromorphic electronics for sensing, thinking, and acting in advanced robotic systems. Organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials are discussed for implementing perception, navigation, and control in robots. Future research directions in the field are outlined. Leveraging various neuromorphic electronics unlocks the full potential of intelligent robotic systems for diverse applications.

AB This paper is based on some assumptions validated using real data and the most used Forex trading platform Meta Trader 4. First, we assume that any reasonable and relatively simple models, reflecting some trading hypotheses, can be profitable for a certain period. Having a sufficient set of such models optimized for selected currency pairs, we can use the model that provides the greatest profit in the current trading period. The second proposal is to use a fuzzy multiple-criteria approach at the training optimization stage using historical data in order to overcome or reduce the negative effect of overfitting. Here for the first time, the problem of fuzzy multiple-criteria optimization of trading was formulated and solved based on the output parameters of the developed simple single-criteria crisp models. This provides significantly greater profit than that obtained using single-criteria crisp models. The third proposal is to use the hierarchical structure of fuzzy local criteria to solve the multiple-criteria problem. It is shown that this additionally provides a significant increase in profit. The profitability and riskless of the developed trading models are studied based on real quotations of currency pairs USDJPY, EURUSD and AUDUSD using H4 timeframe.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) has three main drawbacks in case of partially shaded photovoltaic systems. First, it converges slowly to the global peak (GP). Second, because PSO is a time invariant, it cannot adhere to a dynamic GP in the presence of various temporal shading patterns and instead, sticks to the first GP. Third, it exhibits high oscillations around GP. To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel hybrid modified PSO-PID (MPSO-PID) with anti-windup strategy based maximum power point tracking. The antiwindup strategy aims to guarantee the robustness of the PID controller and eliminate the PID windup outcome. Two anti-windup structures were applied to PID namely: anti-windup using back calculation and antiwindup using conditional integration. For validation purpose, the hybrid MPSO-PID with anti-windup has been compared with conventional PSO and three modified PSO versions namely: PSO with random numbers eliminated (PSO-RNE), PSO with linearly varying parameters (PSO-LVP), and PSO with fixed maximum iterations (PSO-FMI). The obtained simulation and experimental results revealed that the proposed MPSO-PID with antiwindup overcome the previous shortcomings providing outperformance to track dynamic GP with a less convergence time and small oscillations around GP compared to other algorithms. The proposed MPSO-PID technique has a minimum average response time; 0.026 s; to catch the GP under various shading patterns compared to the other PSO versions; CPSO, PSO-LVP, PSO-RNE, and PSO-FMI; where the average response time are 0.026 s, 0.531s, 0.446 s, 0.763 s, and 0.494 s respectively. Finally, the results proved the robustness and effectiveness of PID design for enhancing both the PSO and PV system performance.

AB This paper is concerned with the extended dissipative filtering for IT2 systems with semi-Markovian switching. In order to obtain general filtering results, the mode-dependent boundness is introduced for the semi-Markovian chain. An analysis result for the underlying system is established by utilizing a novel stochastic characteristic of index function in extended dissipativity. Facilitated by a decoupling technique, the extended dissipative filter can be developed in light of the obtained analysis result. Simulation examples including tunnel diode circuit are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Gas turbine engines are machines of high complexity and non-linearity. Interpreting the vast amount of data from a gas turbine and converting them into customer value requires the combination of domain knowledge and modern computational intelligence tools. Reaching to an accurate and reliable diagnosis of gas turbines is a process that is becoming increasingly complex. The engines are now expected to operate in more dynamic conditions to compensate for the intermittent nature of renewables. Transient operating conditions will accelerate the deterioration of gas turbine components which motivates the development of new methods and tools to cope with such type of information. In this paper, we propose a novel performance diagnostic method for gas turbines that combines a dynamic engine model with artificial neural networks (ANN). An engine model of a two shaft gas turbine has been developed in MATLAB/Simulink and used by a family of ANNs to detect the degradation of the engine operating under transient conditions, when all of its components are experiencing degradation. The conducted case studies consider various degradation scenarios. The advantage of the proposed method is that it deals effectively with both fixed and time-evolving degradation. Furthermore, in cases where there is limited amount of data for training ANNs the model can fill this gap by simulating plethora of scenarios that can potentially extend the applicability of ANNs to gas turbine diagnostics. The proposed method could be used as a tool for supporting the operation and maintenance activities of gas turbines.

ID APPEARANCE; DIFFERENCE
AB Research on appearance gaze estimation based on deep learning has achieved considerable results. However, a lack of information in the extracted local blocks reduces the precision of gaze estimation since CNNs do not prioritize the information within the key picture blocks for face image estimation. In this research, fine-grained visual information is extracted from local blocks using a Transformer in Transformer (TNT) model that emphasizes the interactions between local blocks. First, TNT-based gaze estimation models (GTiT-Pure and GTiTHybrid) are established with the TNT model to capture both coarse- and fine-grained visual information about the face, which are then combined to provide a feature representation for gaze regression. Then, the performance of the two models are evaluated on four gaze estimation datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the pretrained GTiT-Pure has less gaze estimation error than the majority of CNNs and Transformer models, and that the GTiT-Hybrid model performs the best on the EyeDiap and RT-Gene datasets. The GTiT model which combines both coarse- and fine-grained gaze features in face images, can be used to further explore the advantages of the Transformer model in gaze feature extraction.

AB In process industry, it is a habitual phenomenon that the production efficiency is improved via replacing the obsolete devices with the advanced ones. To achieve an optimal performance, these devices are always required for heavily empirical adjustments, which is very time-consuming and inefficient. Though outdated, invaluable experiences for adjusting devices towards a more efficient industrial production have been accumulated by those replaced facilities. Thereby, new devices are expected to adapt to perform the industrial task without many modulations if the aforementioned experiences can be appropriately utilized. Inspired by the fact that evolutionary multitasking is capable of exploiting latent similarities and commonalities among multiple optimization tasks so as to improve the overall convergence of multi-task optimization, in this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically search for the optimal settings for new devices based on the knowledge accumulated by the old. The framework, dubbed Piggybacking on Past Problem for Faster Optimization (PPPFO), is able to piggyback on the past optimization problem for a faster convergence of the targeted. By means of automatically transferring search experiences (i.e. genetic and cultural characteristics) from source task to the target, PPPFO can assist an engineering optimizer to improve its search exercises. PPPFO has been tested with a number of widely used benchmark functions and has been successfully adopted to an important real application, i.e., aluminum electrolysis process design. The remarkable results verify the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed framework.

AB Real-time semantic segmentation in traffic scenes plays an essential part in autonomous driving. The encoder-decoder-based network architecture can well combine the context information and detailed information required for the semantic segmentation task. Achieving a good balance between inference speed and accuracy is a crucial challenge, as considerable real-time semantic segmentation models process information in real-time at the expense of accuracy degradation. This paper presents an encoder-decoder network model based on Cross Stage Partial (CSP) block for real-time semantic segmentation in traffic scenes. Integrating the CSP block can not only lessen the computational overhead but also enhance the feature extraction ability of the network. In addition, we append the Fast Spatial Pyramid Pooling module to the backbone of the network, which can aggregate global information at a low computational cost. On NVIDIA RTX 3090, the middle model of our method can achieve a mean intersection over union (mIOU) of 80.8% at 64.3 frames per second (FPS) on the Cityscapes test set and an mIOU of 81.3% at 105.3 FPS on the CamVid Test Set. The large model of our method can realize an mIOU of 81.5% at 48.4 FPS on the test set of Cityscapes. Our source code is available at https://github.com/zhouliguo/cspsg.

ID SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AB People increasingly use social media platforms to express themselves by posting visuals and texts. As a result, hate content is on the rise, necessitating practical visual caption analysis. Thus, the relationship between image and caption modalities is crucial in visual caption analysis. Contrarily, most methods combine features from the image and caption modalities using deep learning architectures with millions of parameters already trained without integrating a specialized attention module, resulting in less desirable outcomes. This paper suggests a novel multi-modal architecture for identifying hateful memetic information in response to the above observation. The proposed architecture contains a novel "multi-scale kernel attentive visual" (MSKAV) module that uses an efficient multi-branch structure to extract discriminative visual features. Additionally, MSKAV utilizes an adaptive receptive field using multi-scale kernels. MSKAV also incorporates a multi-directional visual attention module to highlight spatial regions of importance. The proposed model also contains a novel "knowledge distillation-based attentional caption" (KDAC) module. It uses a transformer-based self-attentive block to extract discriminative features from meme captions. Thorough experimentation on multi-modal hate speech benchmarks MultiOff, Hateful Memes, and MMHS150K datasets achieved accuracy scores of 0.6250, 0.8750, and 0.8078, respectively. It also reaches impressive AUC scores of 0.6557, 0.8363, and 0.7665 on the three datasets, respectively, beating SOTA multi-modal hate speech identification models.

In light of this, this paper presents a single-image smoker detection framework via human-object interaction with lite transformer network (HOLT-Net). Specifically, a one-stage human-object interaction module is devised to identify the interaction between the smoker and the cigarette. To incorporate the global information for better feature representation, a simple yet powerful lite transformer module is leveraged, where the multi-head self-attention blocks are exploited. Beyond that, a post-refinement module is integrated for taking advantage of an additional fine-grained cigarette detector to enhance the interaction detection accuracy. It is noteworthy that we present a new benchmark dataset named SCAU-Smoker Detection (SCAU-SD), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first benchmark dataset for the specific task of smoker detection in single images with human-object interaction annotations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HOLT-Net framework. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/JackKoLing/HOLT-Net.

AB Stock price trend prediction is a fascinating but difficult research topic. Recently, GNN-based models have been continuously proposed, which are believed to be more effective since they consider the information about stocks themselves and the information between stocks. However, the graph data are often static, unstructured and not all-inclusive, which cannot dynamically reflect all relationships between stocks. Therefore, we propose a novel model PriceExploration-Network (PE-Net), effectively utilizing both temporal and cross-sectional information contained in price to predict the price trend. PE-Net only requires the price data effectively saving the trouble of fetching alternative data and is able to capture the dynamic implicit relations between stocks by combining clustering techniques and GAT architecture. The effectiveness of PE-Net is examined on real-world S & P 500 constituents and the results demonstrate that PE-Net can outperform state-of-the-art models w.r.t. both accuracy and AUC.

AB Human pose estimation (HPE) is a computer vision application that estimates human body joints from images. It gives machines the capability to better understand the interaction between humans and the environment. For this accomplishment, many HPE methods have been deployed in robots, vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This effort raised the challenge of balance between algorithm performance and efficiency, especially in UAVs, where computational resources are limited for saving battery power. Despite the considerable progress in the HPE problem, there are very few methods that are proposed to face this challenge. To highlight the severity of this fact, the proposed paper presents a brief review and an HPE benchmark from the aspect of algorithms performance and efficiency under UAV operation. More specifically, the contribution of HPE methods in the last 22 years is covered, along with the variety of methods that exist. The benchmark consists of 36 pose estimation models in 3 known datasets with metrics that fulfill the paper aspect. From the results, MobileNet-based models achieved competitive performance and the lowest computational cost, in comparison with ResNet-based models. Finally, benchmark results are projected in edge devices hardware specifications to analyze the appropriateness of these algorithms for UAV deployment.

AB Lakes have a crucial impact on natural disaster prevention, resource recycling, maintenance of agricultural production and daily life. The traditional way of acquiring lake water body information lacks efficiency, is dangerous, and is not suitable for lake water body information acquisition and real-time monitoring. For this reason, the automated lake water body extraction method based on deep learning semantic segmentation model is gradually becoming a mainstream method. However, most of the semantic segmentation models used for lake extraction today express features through static semantics, while ignoring the extraction relationships of different convolutional kernels for these features. In order to better extract lake water bodies from remote sensing images, this paper proposes a hybrid semantic segmentation method based on K-Net, which achieves high accuracy extraction of lake water bodies by introducing dynamic semantic kernels to iteratively refine the feature infor-mation. The superiority of the K-Net-based hybrid model on a Google remote sensing image dataset of lakes is validated. The experimental results show that (1) the hybrid model is able to achieve accurate extraction of lake water bodies, with the UperNet +K-Net model using Swin-l performing the best among all six evaluation metrics, with mean intersection over union (mIoU) reaching 97.77%; and that (2) after incorporating the K-Net module, all tested models obtain a larger mIoU than before.

AB For complex last mile problems, the parcel lockers play an important role in urban areas. So, selecting a suitable location is very much crucial to provide optimal service and better logistical performance. From that viewpoint, a multicriteria group decision making method is developed in this article using dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy (DHq-ROF) set which is more effective than existing variations of fuzzy sets. The Aczel-Alsina (AA) class of t-conorms and t-norms (AAt-CNs & t-Ns) emerged as an important class of union and intersection operations due to its greater flexibility in the information fusion process. To take advantage of the benefits of AAt-CNs & t-Ns and hybrid aggregation operators in DHq-ROF environments, several fundamental operations based on AAt-CNs & t-Ns are first defined. Following the introduction of these stated operations, a series of aggregation operators, viz., DHq-ROF AA weighted averaging, ordered weighted averaging, hybrid averaging and their geometric versions with DHq-ROF information, has been proposed. Based on these operators, a creative approach to handle multi-attribute group decision-making problems has been framed. The parcel lockers' location selection problem is estimated to validate the created strategy and show its applicability and efficacy. The achieved results establish that the post office is the best location for locating parcel lockers.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In this paper, an adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller based on a quantum neural network (APIDC-QNN) is introduced. In the proposed neural network structure, three neural layers are used namely: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The input and hidden layers use three and six quantum-processing neurons respectively. In contrast, in the output layer, the multiplication processing is used as an activation function free of the output weights which aims to reduce the number of tunable parameters. The output layer with three neurons represents the adaptive PID controller parameters. In this work, the tunable parameters are updated using the Lyapunov stability criterion to guarantee optimization and learning stability. In addition, the plant identification based on the Wiener-type model and quantum neural network is introduced to estimate the sensitivity of the plant output to the control signal. The proposed neural network structure yields only 30 tunable parameters for the proposed controller and 13 tunable parameters for the proposed identifier while the con-ventional neural network structure in other works requires 90 tunable parameters just for the controller. To evaluate the performance of the proposed APIDC-QNN, it is practically operated on a non-holonomic two-wheel mobile robot (NHWMR). Moreover, to investigate the robustness, superiority, and convergence speed of the proposed APIDC-QNN, some experimental tasks are discussed. The simulation and practical results show the powerful processing and the superiority of the proposed APIDC-QNN over that designed based on conventional neural networks by recording the minimum values of the performance indices.

AB An interval-valued Fermatean hesitant fuzzy set (IVFHFS) not only can be regarded as the union of some interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) but also represent the Fermatean hesitant fuzzy elements (FHFEs) in the form of interval values. So IVFHFSs are extensions of FHFSs and IVFFSs, which are powerful tools to represent more complicated, uncertain, and vague information. This paper focuses on the four kinds of correlation coefficients for FHFSs and extends them to the correlation coefficients and the weighted correlation coefficients for IVFHFSs. In the processing, we develop the least common multiple expansion (LCME) methods to solve the problem that the cardinalities of Fermatean hesitant fuzzy elements (FHFEs) (or interval-valued Fermatean hesitant fuzzy elements (IVPHFEs)) are different. In addition, we propose score functions and accuracy functions of FFEs (or IVFFEs) to rank all the FFEs (or IVFFEs) in an FHFE (or an IVFHFE). Especially, score functions and accuracy functions of IVFFEs are both presented as interval numbers. Then use the comparison method of interval numbers to compare two revised IVFHFEs in order to keep the original fuzzy information as far as possible. What is more, we define the local correlations and local informational energies which can depict the similarity between two IVFHFEs more meticulously and completely. At last, the numerical examples show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed methods in multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) and clustering analysis.

AB Detecting faults in high-speed and high-power diesel engines under complex variable operating conditions is highly challenging. Online vibration monitoring systems have been used in such diesel engines in key fields, in which vibration sensors are installed on each cylinder to enable comprehensive monitoring. In this paper, a fault detection method for diesel engines under variable operating conditions is proposed based on multi-sensor signal multi-scale fusion. Firstly, a preprocessing framework is established for the raw vibration signals collected from each cylinder to eliminate random interference and system noise. Then, the resulting signals are phase-aligned based on the engine firing sequence and analyzed using a signal correlation algorithm to produce a multi-sensor multi-scale similarity matrix (MSMSSM). Finally, a multi-branch residual convolutional neural network (MBRCNN) model is constructed with the MSMSSM as the input to detect abnormal health states of the diesel engine. Fault simulation experiments are conducted on a 12-cylinder V-type high-speed and high-power diesel engine test rig. The comparative test results indicate that the proposed MSMSSM-MBRCNN method shows both the highest accuracy of 95.28% and the lowest standard deviation of 3.57% compared to other typical methods. The multi-sensor signals multi-scale fusion method proposed in this paper fully utilizes the key information that remains basically consistent in the synchronous acquisition signals of multiple sensors under different operating conditions. This can effectively reduce the interference of operating condition changes and improve the accuracy and robustness of fault detection.

AB The detection of cracks is essential for assessing and maintaining building and road safety. However, the large appearance variations and the complex topological structures of cracks bring challenges to automatic crack detection. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose a deep multi-scale crack feature learning model called DeepCrackAT for crack segmentation, which is based on an encoder-decoder network with feature tokenization mechanism and attention mechanism. Specifically, we use hybrid dilated convolutions in the first three layers of the encoder-decoder to increase the network's receptive field and capture more crack information. Then, we introduce a tokenized multilayer perceptron (Tok-MLP) in the last two layers of the encoder-decoder to tokenize and project high-dimensional crack features into low-dimensional space. This helps to reduce parameters and enhance the network's ability of noise resistance. Next, we concatenate the features corresponding to the encoder-decoder layers and introduce the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to enhance the network's perception of the critical crack region. Finally, the five-layer features are fused to generate a binary segmentation map of the crack image. We conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies on two real-world crack datasets, and DeepCrackAT achieved 97.41% and 97.25% accuracy on these datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB Possessing efficient supervisory control systems is crucial for maintaining the desired operational performance of complex industrial processes. Several challenges face the developers of these systems, such as requiring accurate physical models, dealing with the variability and uncertainty of process operating conditions and coordinating between local controllers to reach desired global performance. This paper proposes an intelligent supervisory control approach based on causal reinforcement learning (CRL) to effectively manipulate the controllers' setpoints of the process in a way that optimizes its key performance indicators (KPIs), thereby improving the energy efficiency of the process. The approach adopts deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop an efficient control policy through interaction with a process simulation. The DRL training history is then exploited using interpretable machine learning and process mining to build a discrete event system (DES) model, in the form of a state-event graph. The DES model identifies causal relationships between events and provides interpretability to the control policy developed by the DRL method. The DES discovered is exploited as a Markov decision process to apply the Q-learning algorithm as a CRL supervisor. The supervisor incorporates causal knowledge into its training process, thus improving the DRL control policy developed and identifying the event paths that optimize the process's KPIs. The proposed approach is validated using two heat recovery systems in a pulp & paper mill. It successfully achieves a control policy that reduces energy consumption by up to 15.6% for the first system and 5.02% for the second, compared to the expert's baseline methods.

AB Complicated road conditions make organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation characteristics show hysteresis and uncertainty. Under the strong coupling correlation of many operating parameters, how to realize the dynamic optimization of ORC comprehensive performance is the key to obtain practical application potential. Based on ensemble learning mechanism, neural network modeling, ensemble system, unsupervised learning, partial mutual information and optimization algorithm are integrated. This paper presents a nonlinear time series prediction and dynamic multi-objective optimization scheme. The average accuracy increased by at least 59.6%. Taking the thermodynamic performance and environmental impact as optimization objectives, dynamic multiobjective optimization is carried out under road conditions. The optimization scheme can effectively trade off the nonlinear correlation between thermal efficiency and emissions of CO2 equivalent.

AB Ceramic nanoparticles have become increasingly popular owing to their wide range of engineering applications in the industry. Silica is one of the most promising nanomaterials for heat transfer applications due to its favorable thermophysical characteristics and dispersion stability. This work investigates the thermophysical properties of polydisperse SiO2 nanoparticles in a glycerol and water mixture. Aqueous glycerol nanofluid comprised 30% glycerol (30 GW) by weight, and SiO2 with mean particle sizes of 15, 50, and 100 nm were prepared for 0.5 and 1.0% volume concentrations using a two-step method. Measurements of properties are made in the temperature range of 30-100oC. The nanofluids behaved as a single-phase liquid remaining stable for four weeks. The viscosity and density of the base liquid and nanofluid decreased while the thermal conductivity increased with temperature. The base liquid-specific heat increased slightly while that of nanofluid decreased significantly with temperature. For 0.5% SiO2 concentration, the thermal conductivity and viscosity varied by 11.1% and 32%, respectively at 60oC compared to the base liquid. Correlations are developed for the estimation of nanofluid properties. An Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique called Bayesian approach optimized Gaussian Process Regression was employed to develop a prognostic model for the thermophysical properties of test nanofluids. In addition, the model's predictability and explainability are both enhanced by the use of kernel functions, which makes it possible to include historical data in the representation of a phenomenon. The test XAI approaches were shown as robust one because of the high correlation values, which ranged from 99.68% to 99.99%, along with minimal modeling errors.

AB Elastoplastic modeling is essential for accurately predicting material behavior in various engineering applications. However, existing approaches to developing intelligent models for elastoplasticity face limitations due to the scarcity of available data, particularly in cases where experiments cannot support full training of these models. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed few-shot learning framework that incorporates classic elastoplasticity theory as prior knowledge. Instead of directly solving specific constitutive ordinary differential equations, we utilize general mechanical inequations as physical regularization to confine the optimization space. Our framework is model-agnostic in the uniaxial scenario and free from complicated numerical implementation, preserving the advantages of the data-driven paradigm in terms of efficiency and simplicity. In the multiaxial scenario, the framework can automatically calibrate multiple interwoven material parameters of the underlying constitutive model, facilitating the generation of ample multiaxial data for downstream learning. To further improve convergence, we introduce a novel training strategy. A numerical experiments with only 32 pieces of training data validate the effectiveness of the developed framework. The trained uniaxial model exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities, achieving 44.9% higher accuracy than the purely data-driven model. For multiaxial relationships, our framework demonstrates remarkable efficiency in calibrating material constants compared to conventional machine or manual methods, and the trained model accurately reproduces highly nonlinear multiaxial elastoplastic curves. Our work addresses the pressing need for accurate elastoplastic modeling in the absence of large datasets and provides a promising new solution that can significantly improve generalization capabilities.

AB In multi-sensor fusion, the Dempster-Shafer theory is frequently used for fault diagnosis and other decisionmaking problems. However, if the information collected from various sensors exhibits uncertainty and high conflict, the classical Dempster's Combination Rule may produce a counter-intuitive result. Various studies were conducted by Ghosh and other scholars to solve this problem, and good results were achieved. This work provides a novel idea which uses the Markov chain to model the uncertainty information in evidence theory, explore the ordered rules in random evidence, and then obtain the evidence support degree, thereby reducing the effect of high-conflict evidence. Considering the information amount of evidence combined with the evidence support degree, the final credibility of evidence is obtained, and the weighted summation is used to obtain new evidence. Finally, the classical Dempster combination rule is used to process new evidence and make the final decision. Through numerical examples and case studies, the proposed method's superior efficiency and robustness over the existing multisensor fault diagnosis methods are illustrated.

AB With the development of smart manufacturing, the health monitoring of the machines has become important. Remaining useful life (RUL) estimation, which could predict the future machine state, has attracted much more attentions. Deep learning (DL) based RUL has achieved remarkable results. But it still faces the issues on the multi-sensor fusion process and the health index (HI) construction, and both of these two issues can affect DL models for RUL. To overcome these issues, this research designed a new hybrid model of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Wiener process, named hybrid CNN-Wiener model. First, the CNN network is adopted to achieve feature-level fusion of multi-sensor signals and to calculate the virtual HI of the machine. Second, the Wiener process model is developed to estimate the value of RUL using virtual HI. Third, the Wiener process model is designed as the layer in CNN network and trained with CNN together. The hybrid CNN-Wiener model has been tested on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset, and its results show that the hybrid CNN-Wiener model has obtained the remarkable promotion by comparing with other famous DL models. The ablation studies have been tested and it shows that the hybrid CNN-Wiener model has been promotion largely with the Wiener model and the multi-sensor fusion techniques.

AB Due to the occasionality and unsustainable characteristics of mechanical faults, the collected data in real scenario is normally imbalanced that subsequently bottlenecks the appropriate fault recognition. In the actual operation of the equipment, there often exists many fault types, but the sample size of each fault is usually extremely unbalanced, which case is similar to the issue of long-tailed distribution. However, most existing approaches dealing with the long-tail problem seldomly utilize sensor structure information to reduce the imbalance impact and the commonly employed cost-sensitive losses fail to meet the comprehensively and complexity of the problem. To address these shortcomings, here we intend to construct a sensor network from the multi-sensor of the system and propose the graph attention U-Net (GATU-Net) to model the sensor network for the fault diagnosis featured with long-tailed distribution. Our proposed algorithm employs graph attention networks for the message passing and feature mining of structural relations among those sensors, and obtains favorable graph embeddings through the U-Nets architecture. In addition, a weighted shrinkage loss is proposed to allow the model to penalize the attention to low-valued samples and increase the attention to high-valued samples. Two experimental case studies unveil that GATU-Net is capable of achieving great performance for fault diagnosis with long-tailed distribution.

AB Human identification is vital in health monitoring, human-computer interaction, safety detection, and other fields. Compared with traditional vision-based methods, millimeter wave radar sensors can protect users' privacy and work in dark environments, which has a wide range of application prospects in iot fields such as smart homes and smart medical care. Previous studies need to manually collect labeled data, which makes the data collection work need substantial human resources and is unsuitable for popularization and application. We automatically collect multi-modal radar signals in users ' daily lives without requiring researchers to label data manually. Based on the proposed data collection method, we established the first semi-supervised data set for human identification, which includes synchronous radar point cloud data and range-velocity map data. The dataset contains four experiments, including ten monitoring users and ten other users. We propose a semi-supervised co-training framework based on multi-modal data fusion for human identification. The framework guides the models to learn from unlabeled data using the complementary characteristics of point cloud data and range-velocity map data. In addition, we propose an information fusion method to fuse the radar data of two modes to further improve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 93.7% human identification accuracy, showing radar-based human identification technology's application and promotion potential.

AB In an actual industrial scenario, machines typically operate normally for the majority of the time, with malfunctions occurring only occasionally. As a result, there is very little recorded data on defects. Consequently, the fault diagnostic dataset becomes imbalanced, with a significantly lower number of fault samples compared to normal samples. Furthermore, with the rapid development of the manufacturing industry, the increasing complexity of machines and equipment leads to various challenges in collecting fault data, such as noise, withinclass imbalance, multi-class imbalance, and time series imbalance. It is worth noting that this study is the first to comprehensively summarize these four specific challenges. Therefore, addressing these issues has become a critical research focus and a pain point in the field of fault diagnosis, and numerous solutions have emerged. This study provides a comprehensive overview of these solutions at three levels: data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classifier improvement. It also describes the applications of imbalanced data classification methods, including pure resampling techniques, as well as sampling techniques that combine resampling algorithms with feature extraction and classifier improvement in industrial scenarios. Finally, we summarize the challenges facing imbalanced data classification research and suggest potential directions for future studies.

ID RESTORATION
AB Deep learning-based approaches have recently achieved considerable results in Poisson denoising under low-light conditions. However, most existing methods mainly focus on the network architecture design, which lacks physical interpretability and thus unsuitable for blind denoising in real environments with unknown levels of noises. To address this issue, we propose a variational Bayesian deep network for blind Poisson denoising (VBDNet). We mainly consider an approximate posterior form for the noise variance in a variational Bayesian framework and utilize a neural network to parameterize the variance of Poisson noise. For network design, VBDNet is divided into two sub-networks. The noise estimation sub-network is responsible for the Bayesian inference. This network improves the blind denoising ability of the subse-quent denoising sub-network by learning Poisson noise characteristics under different noise levels in the training process. A network of U-Net structures implements the denoising sub-network for noise removal. By combining the advantage of Bayesian inference (noise estimation sub-network) and deep learning (de -noising sub-network), VBDNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and natural data.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis is an emerging and critical area of research, particularly in the context of social media where users express their emotions through both text and images. However, existing methods that learn common semantic features between visual and textual modalities for multimodal sentiment analysis often overlook the importance of color information, which plays a crucial role in sentiment expression, according to psychology and art theory. This paper proposes a novel model, named ICCI, which aims to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis in social media by integrating color cues, in order to address the limitation in existing approaches. The proposed model leverages both the semantic information from image-text pairs and the color cues from images to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. The model comprises a feature extraction module that extracts semantic features from both images and text, as well as color features from images. Furthermore, the feature interaction module employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable the interaction of information between semantic features and color features. Finally, the label prediction module integrates all attention features to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis. The proposed model was evaluated through experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets, namely MVSA-Single and MVSA-Multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in outperforming existing methods. On MVSA-Single, ICCI achieved an accuracy of 79.33%. Similarly, on MVSA-Multiple, ICCI achieved an accuracy of 73.29%. The results underscore the importance of integrating color information for more accurate sentiment analysis in social media.

AB Document Retrieval (DR) needs an innovative model to rank and retrieve documents based on their relevancy with respect to some questions that requires strong text understanding capability. The prime motive of documents retrieval is to search the relevant documents that satisfy the user's questions. However, it is a complex process because it means the natural language textual content based on the syntax, context and semantics. Conventional techniques for listing files prefer typical word and sentence encrypting to create constant length document abiding. However, the widely used bag-of-words (BoW) method failed to integrate the signify context, which is a crucial problem to compreh end the document-query relevancy. In order to overcome such issues, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been put forward to arrange search outcomes with respect to user's questions. Here, a unified solution is provided to perform relevant document retrieval using Dwarf Mongoose Optimization Fractional-based Deep Convolutional Neural network (DMOF-Deep CNN). Here, the textual content processing is done based on BERT tokenization and feature term extraction. Moreover, the cluster based indexing by elastic search is accomplished using Fuzzy Local Information C-Means (FLICM) clustering and dice coefficient is employed to perform the query matching. Finally, re-ranking based document retrieval is conducted in terms of deep CNN, which is trained using designed DMOF. In addition, the designed DMOF-Deep CNN has outperformed other existing models by delivering maximum precision of 0.854, recall of 0.913, F1-score of 0.882.

AB This paper proposes a modified artificial intelligence (AI) approach based on the gradient-enhanced physicsinformed neural network (gPINN) with a novel structure for the generalized coupled non-Fickian/non-Fourierian diffusion-thermoelasticity analysis. Previous successful application of gPINN in function approximation and single partial differential equation (PDE) problems gave us enough motivation to develop its application with a novel structure for solving a system of coupled PDEs. The governing equations are formulated for a copper-made strip based upon the Lord-Shulman theory of the generalized coupled thermoelasticity. In order to shed light on the capacity of the gPINN-based approach, three examples with different boundary conditions for a onedimensional half-space are presented, as well as an example for a two-dimensional half-space. The primary goal is to investigate the transient behavior of field variables (i.e., non-dimensional molar concentration, nondimensional displacement, and non-dimensional temperature). Variations of dimensionless stress are also examined in depth. Performance comparisons between the gPINN-based method and commonly used approaches support the efficacy of the gPINN with a novel structure. Detailed sensitivity analyses are provided to sufficiently explore the impact of neural network hyperparameters. Moreover, the effect of relaxation time on the behavior of mass concentration is addressed in a single scenario. Overall, the proposed gPINN-based method with a novel structure yields consistently encouraging and satisfactory results, and this approach entails the capability to be applied to more complicated problems. Numerical results underline the importance of the weights assigned to the derivatives of the loss terms to achieve more accurate predictions. Nonparametric statistical tests offer further evidence for exceptional agreement between gPINN solutions with certain weights and outcomes derived by commonly used analytical techniques.

AB The three-fluid heat exchanger is a multi-stream heat exchanger that provides three streams at different tem-peratures for certain usage objectives. Recently, optimizing heat exchangers generally and three-fluid heat ex-changers especially have received great attention in the energy field. The current study objective is to get the optimal mass flow rate of the three streams to minimize the entropy generation number and maximize effec-tiveness. Optimization is performed on the inserted coiled tube type for 24 cases with different usage objectives and different mass flow rate constraints. The optimization is done using an analytical approach for the tem-perature profiles and a regressed model for the overall heat transfer coefficients. Single-objective and multi-objective genetic algorithms are the optimization algorithms. The result shows that cooling the hot fluid is the most efficient usage objective; however, heating the intermediate-temperature fluid is the less efficient usage objective. Also, the study shows that the entropy generation number is dependent on the mass flow rate constraint. The maximum effectiveness of 0.693 occurs when the usage objective is cooling the hot fluid. In this case, the mass flow rate of the cold and the intermediate-temperature fluids are maxima while the mass flow rate of the hot fluid is minimum. The minimum entropy generation number 0.0486 occurs when the mass flow rate of the cold fluid is maximum while the mass flow rate of the hot fluid and intermediate-temperature fluid are minimal.

AB Among the various physical properties of polypropylene composites (PPCs), heat deflection temperature (HDT) during PPC production is significant because it is directly related to the mechanical behavior of such products. However, it is difficult to predict and analyze the HDT of PPCs owing to the absence of a mathematical or theoretical model. Moreover, categorical data which has different physical properties despite using same substances made predictions highly difficult in PPCs. Here, this study proposed an indicator to analyze the categorical data and Catboost-based model for HDT prediction considering the categorical data. First, the categorization and minimum-based values (MBVs), a dimensionless factor used to calculate HDT differences in the categorical dataset, are applied to detect and split categorical data in a PPC dataset. Second, a case study was conducted on the dataset using three algorithms to compare the proposed model with other traditional machine-learning approaches. As a result, the proposed model provides the highest prediction performance of R2 = 0.8965 and 0.9801, for the total test dataset and the categorical dataset, respectively. In addition, the effect analysis of substances on HDT was conducted to get some prospective substances for the required HDT using Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Thus, the results of this study can provide a guidance for selecting prospective substances using SHAP result for the target HDT and adjusting the substance ratio using the proposed model. It is expected that this framework has the potential for being applied to the other blending processes to produce products with the required properties.

AB Large amounts of unlabeled data are produced from wind turbine condition monitoring systems to catch their operational status. With this unmanageable amount of data, developing robust systems with good performance on unseen test data to detect incipient wind turbine faults is crucial to maximizing wind farm performance. This paper presents an implementation of a robust unsupervised machine-learning approach capable of executing fleet-based anomaly detection in wind turbines' critical components. The proposed methodology is applied to noisy, unlabeled, and unstructured vibration data, which must go through the databank decoding, data engineering, preprocessing, and feature extraction. Twelve operational wind turbines with varying health conditions are used to train, validate, and test the models. Features from different domains (time, frequency, and mechanical domain) are extracted and represented in the model's input. A labeling procedure from expert analysis regarding the condition of each wind turbine component through the evaluation of CMS output was carried out. Combining distinctive approaches to optimize eleven unsupervised machine learning algorithms through an unusual 5x2 cross-validation approach applied to real, noisy, and unstructured wind turbine data represents the paper's novelty. The methodology selected the six best models (k-nearest neighbors, clustering-based local outlier, histogram-based outlier, isolation forest, principal component analysis, and minimum covariance determinant) based on robust performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). These models generalized the problem well and returned reasonable classification metrics for such a complex problem, with values above 90% for the area under the ROC.

AB The time-series changes that are affected by a specific alteration cannot be accurately found using change detection techniques. However, there are not many techniques available for identifying seasonal changes. This study develops a new deep model for identifying reflectance materials depending on optimization. At time instances "t"and "t-1"the images are accumulated in this instance. The Type 2 Fuzzy and Cuckoo Search Based Filter (T2FCS) is used for the pre-processing of two images. Then, Fuzzy Local Information C-Means (FLICM) is used to segment both images. On the image accumulated at time "t"the feature extraction is performed to extract statistical features like mean, variance, kurtosis, energy, skewness, and standard deviation as well as imperative features like Local Optimal Oriented Pattern (LOOP), Local Ternary Pattern (LTP), Local Gabor XOR Pattern (LGXP), and others. The reflectance material is then categorized using a Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Network (DNFN) with segments created from images collected at time instance "t-1"and features collected from "t". The proposed Jaya Student psychology-based optimization (JSPO), which was created by fusing the Jaya algorithm and the Student psychology-based optimization method(SPBO), is used here to train the DNFN. The segmented output that was collected at times "t"and "t-1"is then used to do the change detection. With the highest accuracy (94.1%) and maximum sensitivity (93.8%), the proposed JSPO-based DNFN demonstrated improved performance. For applications involving optical imagery, the Landsat program is crucial.

AB Video Summarization is a video compression/compaction technique to create a shorter yet informative version of original video. Video summarization has offered solutions to plenty of media, user and engineering applications. Though sports video summarization has been an active research topic for some time; there still exists a void for multi-modal, dynamic, generic and domain knowledge based approach for Cricket Sport video summarization. This paper presents a multi-modal video summarization approach to summarize Cricket sport videos. This work captures the domain knowledge acquired from multi-modal (audio-visual) cues. A dual neural network architecture pipeline is proposed to dynamically segment and dynamically summarize Cricket videos for generic target audience. The former Neural Network is grounded on Cricket bowling activity (visual feature) for dynamic video segmentation of Cricket videos. The segments are then forwarded to the latter Neural Network for identification of key segments. The key segment detection module relies on Audio analysis of Cricket video stream to identify exciting, content representative and informative segments as per Cricket domain. Experimental analysis on two novel proposed benchmark datasets, i.e. DPCS (Delivery Play Cricket Sport) image dataset and EXINP (Excited Interval Normal Play) Cricket Dataset (audio based) shows promising results. The results indicate that the proposed multi-modal approach generates exciting, content representative, informative, generic and dynamic summary incorporating domain knowledge of the sport.

AB Sentiment analysis is a process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text. It employs several algorithms including Bayesian, support vector machine, and naive Bayes. Such algorithms utilize text analysis and natural language processing to categorize words as positive, negative, or neutral. It needs decision-making techniques i.e. algorithms to process the words, which ultimately enable companies to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their customers' perceptions of the brand. These techniques are mostly interlinked with computer science, and software that have vital roles in numerous decision-making and problem-solving processes. Natural language processing is one of these techniques which focused on endowing computers with the capacity to comprehend text and spoken language akin to human beings. It is often regarded as a common multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) issue in the field of sentiment analysis. A scenario in which individuals simultaneously choose from the options presented to them is referred to as group decision-making. As a result, this article examines the theory of sentiment analysis algorithms and uses the Step-Wise Weight Assessing Ratio Analysis (SWARA) with Multi-Attributive Border Approximation Area Comparison (MABAC) to evaluate the intrinsic and global advantages, disadvantages, potential, and threats of different sentiment analysis algorithms in detail. This study indicates that (1) accuracy; (2) domain-specificity; (3) scalability; and (4) customizability, are four key components that significantly effect the algorithm's adoption and enhance users' satisfaction. Furthermore, the SWARA is used to determine the weights of attributes. The MABAC approach is then employed to address the decision-making problem scenario. We use a numerical case to compare the extended MABAC approach to other approaches to assess its validity in the field of computer science.

AB This study develops machine learning (ML) models for seismic fragility analysis of steel moment frames. Four ML methods - random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) - were employed for this purpose. Probabilistic seismic demand models, each representing the relationship between the seismic response of a type of structure and ground motion intensity, were used to construct the fragility curves based on nonlinear time history analyses of 616 steel moment frames subjected to 240 ground motions. The first three natural periods of steel moment frames and a capacity limit state defined by the maximum interstory drift were selected as input variables for the ML models. Two parameters (median and logarithmic standard deviation) of a fragility function were considered as output variables for the ML models. For each steel frame, the capacity limit state values considered for maximum interstory drift cover a wide range to generalize the fragility curve outcomes. The interquartile range method was used to ensure the quality of the dataset, and consequently 56,479 data points were used for the development of ML models. Based on model performance, the GBRT (R2 = 0.9986, for the testing dataset) and XGBoost (R2 = 0.9987) models are proposed as the best models for fragility analysis of steel moment frames. Finally, a graphical user interface for fragility analysis of steel moment frames was built based on the two proposed models, for easy access by practicing engineers. This study demonstrates the applicability of ML methods in practical design.

AB Designing resilient supply chain networks for vaccine development and distribution requires reliable and robust infrastructure. This stud develops a novel two-stage decision support framework for configuring multi-echelon Supply Chain Networks (SCNs), resilient supplier selection, and order allocation under uncertainty. Resilient supplier selection is done using a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach based on Best-Worst Method (BWM), Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS), and Type-2 Neutrosophic Fuzzy Numbers (T2NN). A robust multi-objective optimization model is then built for order allocation considering resiliency scores, reliability of facilities, and uncertain supply and demand. The objectives are to minimize the total cost of SCN design, maximize the resiliency score, and maximize the reliability of SC, respectively. A Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed to tackle the problem on large scales, tuned by the Taguchi design technique. The NSGA-II solution is compared to the & epsilon;-constraint and Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) solutions using test problems. We demonstrate the superiority of the suggested NSGA-II method over the two competing methods according to five performance metrics. A case study is then investigated to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the offered methodology for COVID-19 vaccine distribution in a developing country. It is revealed that the models and algorithms can treat the problem optimally, such that Germany is the main source (approximately 25.61%) while India does not contribute to the supply of vaccines.

DE Rolling bearing; Fault diagnosis; Dynamic spectrum loss; Generative
   adversarial network; Imbalanced data
AB Intelligent fault diagnosis with imbalanced data is a problem that often raises concerns. The diagnosis is more effective when the imbalanced dataset is supplemented with data augmentation methods, but there is always a gap between the real data and the generated data, especially in the frequency domain. Therefore, a dynamic spectrum loss generative adversarial network (DSLGAN) is developed for intelligent fault diagnosis. Firstly, a generative information enhancement module is built to simultaneously enhance inefficient information of the generative network from different information sources, thus creating a stable and efficient environment for the generation. Secondly, the spectrum distance is designed to find the difference in spectrum location between the real data and the generated data quantitatively by distance metric, which is used to guide the model training to generate high-quality data with similar features to the real data. Finally, the dynamic spectrum loss is proposed based on the spectrum distance to break through the synthesis of difficult frequencies in the data, by reducing the weight of easily synthesized frequencies in the spectrum while dynamically focusing on the difficult frequency components during training to achieve better generation results. In addition, experiments are conducted using several datasets, and the diagnostic accuracy of DSLGAN is 99.63% and 99.65%, reaching a very high level and verifying the effectiveness and superiority of DSLGAN.

AB The concrete mix proportion design process is complex but important, especially in cold, ocean, underground and other complex engineering environments. In this study, a hybrid intelligent optimization method based on the random forest (RF), recursive feature elimination (RFE), Bayesian optimization (BO), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NGSA)-III was proposed to optimize the concrete mix proportion and rapidly and accurately predict the frost resistance, chloride ion penetration resistance and concrete strength (CS). Adopting a key project in Jilin Province as an example, the RF-RFE-BO-LSSVM-NSGA-III algorithm achieved a significant optimization effect in terms of the chloride ion permeability coefficient (CIPC), relative dynamic elastic modulus (RDEM) and 28-day CS. After optimization, the chloride ion penetration resistance, frost resistance and CS increased by 34.6%, 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively, over the average levels of the sample data. This study can provide basis for concrete mix proportion design in complex environment.

AB Numerical analysis and machine learning regression were carried out for understanding and description of ozonation process combined with membrane separation. The main focus was on mass transfer modeling to simulate concentration distribution of ozone in liquid phase. Machine learning regression models were utilized to decrease the computational expenses of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations. For machine learning models, we compared the performance of three regression models, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB or XGboost) for predicting the obtained output of CFD simulations which was ozone concentration in the feed, i.e., C (mol/m3) as function of radial and axial coordinates. Hyper-parameter tuning for these models was performed using the Tabu Search algorithm. The results indicate that both GPR and DNN models achieved excellent prediction accuracy, with R-squared values of 0.99999 and 0.99998, respectively. Also, the RMSE for GPR and DNN were 3.8481E-03 and 4.9835E-03, respectively, while their maximum errors were 6.08501E-02 and 4.47909E-02, respectively. On the other hand, the XGB model showed a lower performance, with an R-squared value of 0.99402, an RMSE of 8.9484E-02, and a maximum error of 4.51381E-01

AB This paper presents neuro-augmented vision for evolutionary robotics (NAVER), which aims to address the two biggest challenges in camera-equipped robot evolutionary controllers. The first challenge is that camera images typically require many inputs from the controller, which greatly increases the complexity of optimising the search space. The second challenge is that evolutionary controllers often cannot bridge the reality gap between simulation and the real world. This method utilises a variational autoencoder to compress the camera image into smaller input vectors that are easier to manage, while still retaining the relevant information of the original image. Automatic encoders are also used to remove unnecessary details from real-world images, in order to better align with images generated by simple visual simulators. NAVER is used to evolve the controller of a robot, which only uses camera inputs to navigate the maze based on visual cues and avoid collisions. The experimental results indicate that the controller evolved in simulation and transferred to the physical robot, where it successfully performed the same navigation task. The controller can navigate the maze using only visual information. The controller responds to visual cues and changes its behaviour accordingly. NAVER has shown great potential as it has successfully completed (so far) the most complex vision-based task controller in evolutionary robotics literature.

AB To ensure the uninterrupted operation of physical assets, the effective implementation of risk mitigation plans (RMPs) and business continuity plans (BCPs) for critical assets is required. However, manufacturing decision makers face the challenge of allocating limited resources between RMPs and BCPs while prioritizing sustained success. To address this challenge, a novel approach proposes integrating a metaheuristic algorithm into a risk management framework that considers interconnected risks. The framework utilizes a Bayesian Network (BN) to model interdependencies among critical physical asset risks. It determines the optimal combination of BCPs and RMPs, considering continuity measures and resource limitations. A physical asset risk assessment process evaluates operational and disruption risks based on expected loss and probabilities within the risk network. Given the complexity, the proposed framework incorporates hybrid multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms (e.g., Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2), Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), and Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II)) combined with a reinforcement learning approach. A case study of a manufacturing company demonstrates the framework's applicability and discusses the results. The findings show a significant reduction in the expected loss within the risk network and migration of most physical asset risks from high-risk to acceptable areas. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis examines the available budget, aiding decision-makers in determining the necessary compromise between asset availability and network risk level. In conclusion, the proposed framework empowers decision-makers to allocate resources effectively, prioritize RMPs and BCPs, and ensure continuity for critical physical assets, thereby fostering sustained success in manufacturing systems.

AB Optimization of SO2 emission and the process cost in catalytic hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is of great importance for the petroleum industry. Given that the process of HDS is complicated, machine learning-based models are suitable for the purpose of process optimization in which the cost and separation efficiency can be optimized efficiently. In this investigation, we are working with a data collection on the HDS process to model via machine learning models. Pressure, temperature, initial sulfur content, and catalyst dose constitute the inputs for the models. Outputs include sulfur concentration (ppm), emission of gas (%), and HDS process cost ($). To model the process, for the first time, four tree-based ensemble methods are developed including Gradient Boosting, Extreme gradient boosting, Random Forest, and Extra Trees to optimize the HDS process. The models tuned on the available dataset and then the best ones selected for each output For sulfur concentration the extra tree model is the most accurate and for other outputs extreme gradient boosting has the best performance. For the models, the R2 scores for outputs are 0.983, 0.982, and 0.995, respectively.

AB This paper presents an aircraft conceptual design technique with more than three objective functions, called many-objective optimisation. The selection of aircraft configuration is usually achieved using a system engineering approach. This selection approach has the design variables assigned to remove the configuration decision-making process. The design problem is demonstrated for the conceptual design of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. Eight objective functions, including power required, take-off weight, take-off distance, landing distance, endurance, range, lift coefficient at cruise and drag coefficient at cruise, are posed, while the constraints are aircraft stability, performance required and take-off distance. Design variables simultaneously determine an aircraft configuration, shape and sizing parameters. Hence a new, many-objective metaheuristic is developed to increase the design performance. A grid-based many-objective metaheuristic with iterative parameter distribution estimation (MM-IPDE-Gr) is developed. It is an enhanced variant of the MM-IPDE with improved reproduction schemes, adaptive parameters and a grid-based clustering technique. Several additional reproduction schemes in mutation and crossover processes with two additional adaptive parameters are integrated to increase population diversity and improve the exploration ability of the algorithm. In addition, the gridbased method is integrated as a clustering technique to improve the Pareto clustering process in many-objective optimisation. The proposed method, with established newly invented metaheuristics, is used to solve the new design problem and its performance compared with existing design methods. It is shown that the proposed manyobjective metaheuristic gives the best results.

AB Prediction and uncertainty quantification of tumor progression are vital in clinical practice, i.e., disease prognosis and decision-making on treatment strategies. In this work, we propose TGM-Nets, a deep learning framework that combines bioimaging and tumor growth modeling (TGM) for enhanced prediction of tumor growth. This proposed framework, developed based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), is capable of integrating the TGM and sequential observations of tumor morphology for patient-specific prediction of tumor growth. The novelties of the design of TGM-Nets include the employment of Fourier layers to extract the features of the input images as well as the utilization of sequential learning and fine-tuning with physics for extrapolation to improve the prediction accuracy. The validity of TGM-Nets for tumor growth forecasting is verified by testing the model performance on synthetic and in-vitro datasets, respectively. Our results show that the TGM-Nets not only can track the growth rates of the mild and aggressive tumors but also capture their detailed morphological features within and outside the training domain. In particular, TGM-Nets can be used to predict the long time dynamics of tumor growth in mild and aggressive cases. Our results show that the parameters inferred from the TGM-Nets can be used for long-time prediction for up to 4 months with a maximum error of & SIM; 4%. We also systematically study the effects of the number of training points and noisy data on the performance of TGM-Nets as well as quantify the uncertainty of the model predictions. We show that TGM-Nets can integrate the biomedical images to predict the growth of the in-vitro cultured pancreatic cancer cells and identify the associated growth rates, demonstrating the possibilities of using TGM-Nets in clinical practice. In summary, we propose a new deep learning model that combines imaging and TGM to improve the current approaches for predicting tumor growth and thus provide an advanced computational tool for patient-specific tumor prognosis.

AB When monitoring combustion conditions, detecting minor variations, which may be complex even for the human eye, is critical for providing a fast response and correcting deviations. The aim of this study is to detect slight variations in combustion conditions by developing a flame monitoring system using machine learning and computer vision techniques applied to color images. Predictive models are developed for fuel blends with different heating values. The predictive models classify the combustion equivalence ratio based on multiple conditions, using a mean step size of 0.10 between states, a lower value than previously reported in related studies. Three machine learning algorithms are used for each fuel blend: logistic regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network (multilayer perceptron). These models are fed the statistical, geometrical, and textural features extracted from the color images of the flames. The classification achieves accuracies from 0.78 to 0.97 in the detection of slight variations in the combustion conditions for all heating values. Thus, the monitoring system developed in this study is a promising alternative for implementation on an industrial scale and quick detection of changes in combustion conditions.

AB Green product design, i.e., design that harmonizes with the environment, is a crucial component for addressing environmental considerations in the earliest stages of the product life cycle, e.g., new energy vehicles (NEVs), that minimize negative environmental impacts. The designs can encompass material selection, resource use, production requirements, recycling, reuse and the disposal of products. Selecting the optimal design alternative considering multiple attribute indices, e.g., environmental indicators and functional indicators, is a typical multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. This study proposes a hybrid preference-based MADM method with spherical-Z fuzzy numbers (SZFNs) for solving the green product design fuzzy information problem. SZFNs are designed to mine the internal hidden information of traditional Z-numbers, and they combine the characteristics of the reliability constraints of Z-numbers and the advantages of spherical linguistic sets. The operation, aggregation operators and probabilistic measure method of SZFNs are defined in this study. The weight vector of the criteria is obtained by adopting the degree of possibility of spherical-Z (DPSZ). The hybrid MADM method is developed by incorporating the total utility of spherical-Z, which is used to convert the internal meaning of the evaluation information into an additive ratio assessment using gray relation analysis (ARAS-GRA) to obtain the optimal alternative. Finally, a case study, i.e., five green product design schemes for NEVs, is adopted to verify the effectiveness and robustness of this proposed method. A comparative analysis, sensitivity analysis and comprehensive discussion are conducted in this research. The results confirm that this proposed method has an improved performance, and provides some references for designers.

AB Image segmentation is a key step in image processing tasks, which has significant applications in computer vision field such as medical image analysis, scene understanding and video monitoring, etc. However, image segmentation tasks usually require a large number of labeled samples to obtain great performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Active learning (AL) can select valuable samples for annotation, so as to reduce the annotation cost as much as possible while maintaining the performance of CNNs. Further, one-shot AL can select valuable samples by once, which eliminates the need for iterative sample selection and annotation. However, existing one-shot AL approaches extremely rely on complex clustering algorithm, which brings a limitation in practice, i.e., we often do not know how to set the hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose a clustering-free one-shot AL framework, which is based on self-supervised feature learning and density-based query strategy. Our framework can select samples with high local density robustly against hyperparameters. The experimental results are impressive that state-of-the-art one-shot active learning performance can be achieved with simple density-based sampling.

AB In this paper, we introduce a novel generative adversarial network (GAN), called PolarGAN, that is capable of creating realistic artificial images of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) for data augmentation. One of the key features of the PolarGAN is that it considers real-valued geometric preferences, defined by six statistics, to generate SIC images that align with specific geometric characteristics. Unlike other GANs that also consider user-defined preferences, the PolarGAN allows for more detailed control over the shape and size of the generated images by using differentiable projection functions to convert the created images into geometric features, and a newly-designed loss function to minimize the gap between the user-defined preferences and the geometric features of the generated images. Through extensive experimentation, we compare the PolarGAN with other GANs and demonstrate artificial SIC scenarios that can be used to test the performance of algorithms for Arctic route planning in edge cases or to improve data-driven models such as SIC prediction models which require additional data to avoid overfitting issues.

AB In reservoir simulation, the linearization process after the discretization of the seepage equation will addi-tionally introduce new errors, which can be avoided by using a nonlinear solver based on a deep neural network. In this paper, we propose a new solution method without needing linearization of the discretized seepage equation, which combines residual network and correction iteration method to solve nonlinear system of equations instead of using Newton method. The residual network is trained based on label data generated by seepage equation and approximates the solution, and the error of approximated solution is used as the new input of the trained residual network model for the next correction iteration. The single-phase seepage equation is solved to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Numerical results indicate that, error caused by linearization significantly affects the solution accuracy, which reduces solution accuracy and time step. Under the same time step, the proposed solution method has higher accuracy, and under the premise of ensuring the solution accuracy, the time step of proposed method increases by more than three times.

AB This research proposes a unique cloud-assisted collaborative estimating system for on-road sensors like potholes, ice, and road profile to develop next-generation automobiles that are safer, more efficient, and more comfortable. Conventional road information finding methods for a single vehicle are prone to model uncertainty and measurement mistakes. The proposed system iteratively improves estimate performance using many heterogeneous vehicles. Each vehicle merges its onboard measurements with pseudomeasurements from previous participating cars and transmits the resulting local onboard estimate back to the cloud for updating. The system uses a Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) approach to manage uncertain readings. The study includes the road segment length of 40 m, 2 sensors for sprung mass and suspension displacements, time span of 1.5 s, a sampling time of 0.01 s, and 151 estimation points per Kalman Filter (KF). Additionally, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was calculated for onboard estimation performance, and training was conducted using data from one vehicle and 10 vehicles for the cloud-based NIGP performance evaluation. Using pseudo-measurements from preceding vehicles significantly improves performance. Comparing the standard GP regression, the NIGP regression and a benchmark based on KF averaging estimations. The NIGP provides better variance and reduces uncertainty. Moreover, the pseudo-measurement strategy iteratively improves onboard performance when using NIGP pseudo-measurements. A detailed experimental plan is described to measure the performance of the proposed collaborative estimating method while considering fleet heterogeneity, measurement noise, and model uncertainty.

AB Given one or several annotation samples, few-shot segmentation has the capability to complete the segmentation of unseen target objects, thereby reducing the need for extensive data annotation. However, due to the scarcity and diversity of data, it becomes challenging to employ a few support samples effectively for guiding the segmentation of one query sample. Most existing approaches are committed to excavating support samples' information while ignoring the crucial relationship between query and support samples. To address this limitation and capture richer mutual information, we propose a query-support semantic correlation mining module that serves as an elaborate guide for subsequent dense matching. Specifically, two kinds of query guide maps are generated that leverage global and local similarities to learn the comprehensive correlation between multi-scale support and query features. By incorporating this module, the network can better execute dense matching and mitigate the possibility of misclassification effectively. In addition, a dual-attention module is introduced to obtain a discriminating initial prototype representation to avert prototype bias. Furthermore, our method generalizes well in the k-shot setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL -5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is potent and successful, which yields competitive segmentation results with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Today's consumers' awareness of environmental protection and social morality is forcing companies to implement sustainable supply chains. Choosing a green supplier can not only determine the sustainable development of the supply chain, but also protect the environment and enhance the company's reputation, in line with the background of green development. Green supplier selection is a multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problem. Type-2 neutrosophic number (T2NN) can be compatible with more fuzzy information, and the green supplier selection problem also has a lot of fuzzy information, which makes T2NN very suitable for supplier selection. In this paper, a new method named CPT-TODIM-CDMT is proposed for green supplier selection of T2NN set based on TODIM. A new distance measure named cosine distance measure is proposed for T2NN set, and is applied in TODIM method. In this new method, attribute weight is determined by entropy method and optimized by CPT. The gains and losses preference in the CPT is also applied to the step of calculating the dominance degree in the TODIM method. A case study is used to verify the method. Through the comparison of the results of different decision-making models and the sensitivity research of the coefficients in the model, the correctness, validity and stability of the model are verified.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; MODELS
AB The traditional flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) ignores transportation issues or merely introduces a time lag for transportation tasks while assuming an infinite number of transportation resources. With the development of intelligent manufacturing, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which are the key transportation equipment for manufacturing enterprises, have been widely used for their high flexibility and stability. In addition, the increase in energy consumption and the trend of green manufacturing make it critical to take into account energy-related objectives in the decision-making of scheduling. Therefore, the multi-objective green scheduling problem of integrated flexible job shop and AGVs (MOGSP-IFJS & AGVs) is addressed in this paper. To solve this problem effectively, the multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MMIP) model is formulated to minimize total energy consumption and makespan simultaneously. An efficient heuristic algorithm (EHA) is designed to solve the MMIP model. In the EHA, one solution encoding scheme and corresponding greedy insertion decoding method considering the selection of AGVs are presented. To acquire a high-quality initial population, the population initialization method balancing the processing time and energy consumption is designed. Further, a local search strategy is presented to enhance the quality of solutions and accelerate the convergence speed of the EHA. Experiment results of 45 test instances indicate that the EHA can obtain better solutions than that of comparison algorithms, which confirms the effectiveness of the EHA for solving the MOGSP-IFJS & AGVs.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Fault diagnosis is an important technology for performing intelligent manufacturing. To simultaneously maintain high manufacturing quality and low failure rate for manufacturing systems, it is of great value to accurately locate the fault element, evaluate the fault severity and find the fault root cause. In order to effectively perform feature extraction for rotating machinery fault diagnosis, a robust discriminant latent variable manifold learning (RDLVML) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Specifically, RDLVML algorithm could effectively select the features of the high-dimensional fault data, and extract the low-dimensional fault features with better discrimination. Through the idea of discriminative learning, the accuracy of fault diagnosis was improved by increasing the aggregation of the same state feature samples and the difference between different classes of feature samples. A novel weighted neighborhood graph is proposed by constructing the q-Re & PRIME;nyi kernel function, which could effectively suppress the interference of outliers and noise, and make the RDLVML algorithm more robust. Moreover, the fault diagnosis method of rotating machinery based on RDLVML is proposed in this paper. Through experimental verifications and comparisons with several classical feature selection algorithms, rotating machinery fault diagnosis could be more accurately performed by this method.

AB Aiming at the operation control of doubly-fed induction generator-wind energy systems, this study firstly introduces multi-dimensional information feedback and fractional-order theory and designs a high-dimensional multi-fractional-order controller in the rotor side converter. Secondly, for the tuning optimization of controller parameters of doubly-fed induction generators, this study proposes a high-dimensional multi-fractional-order optimization. Finally, this study proposes a multi-objective high-dimensional multi-fractional-order optimization algorithm for the multi-objective optimization problems of control parameters tuning and optimization. This study adopts an adaptive grid strategy to update non-dominated solutions for external archives with crowded conditions. Furthermore, this study adopts a roulette strategy to select the optimal global position in the iterative process. This study utilizes multi-objective test functions to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective optimization. The Pareto optimal solutions and five types of statistical data from two indexes show that the proposed multi-objective optimization has improved convergence, diversity, and operational stability. Compared with five algorithms, the proposed multi-objective optimization can obtain Pareto optimal solutions with uniform distribution and good diversity in the multi-objective tuning of control parameters of the designed multi-objective controllers for doubly-fed induction generators. Therefore, decision-makers can choose the control parameters according to the actual needs. The test results show that the designed multi-objective controller optimized by the proposed multi-objective optimization has more accurate power tracking ability and superior control performance.

ID GENERAL FRAMEWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; MULTIVIEW
AB Graph-based semi-supervised dimension reduction can use the inherent graph structure of samples to propagate label information, and has become a hot research field in machine learning. However, most current methods have strict linear constraints and cannot handle data sampled from nonlinear manifolds; and rely on predefined graphs, which cannot capture the local structure information of data and cannot handle complex non-Gaussian data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new locality-preserved flexible dimension reduction framework, called Semi-supervised Flexible Adaptive Graph Embedding (SFAG), which learns the embedding space that can preserve the local neighborhood structure by constructing a k1-nearest neighbor graph over labeled samples. Then, another k2-nearest neighbor graph is constructed on all samples to adaptively construct the optimal graph, clustering labeled and unlabeled embedding sample points with neighborhood relations into the same sub-manifold sharing the same label information. Last but not least, the hard linear projection constraint is relaxed by adding residual terms to obtain not only the nonlinear embedding of the training samples, but also the linear projection matrix applied directly to the out-of-sample. In addition, two different semi-supervised dimension reduction methods for adaptive construction of optimal graphs are proposed based on the SFAG framework. Several evaluation experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in exploring manifold structures and classification tasks.

AB Due to their high adaptability to varied settings and effective optimization algorithm, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have set the state-of-the-art on image processing jobs for the previous decade. CNNs work in a sequential fashion, alternating between extracting significant features from an input image and aggregating these features locally through "pooling" functions, in order to produce a more compact representation. Functions like the arithmetic mean or, more typically, the maximum are commonly used to perform this downsampling operation. Despite the fact that many studies have been devoted to the development of alternative pooling algorithms, in practice, "max-pooling" still equals or exceeds most of these possibilities, and has become the standard for CNN construction. In this paper we focus on the properties that make the maximum such an efficient solution in the context of CNN feature downsampling and propose its replacement by grouping functions, a family of functions that share those desirable properties. In order to adapt these functions to the context of CNNs, we present (a, b) grouping functions, an extension of grouping functions to work with real valued data. We present different construction methods for (a, b)-grouping functions, and demonstrate their empirical applicability for replacing max-pooling by using them to replace the pooling function of many well-known CNN architectures, finding promising results.

ID NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; RECOGNITION
AB Graph regularized non-negative matrix factorization (GNMF), which is an important extension of NMF, shows good clustering performance on some datasets. However, GNMF only uses one graph to simulate the manifold structure of the data, which may be not accurate enough. Then, some scholars proposed multi-graph regularized NMF(MGNMF). MGNMF first combines multiple graphs into one graph through a linear combination method, and then obtains a low-dimensional representation of the data. However, the representation ability of MGNMF is limited and cannot fully make use of the multi-graph information since MGNMF first combines multiple graphs into one graph and then obtains only one low-dimensional representation of the data, which makes clustering performance unsatisfactory enough. Therefore, we propose an innovative method, i.e., a late fusion scheme for multi-graph regularized NMF(LFS/MGNMF). Different from the existing algorithms, LFS/MGNMF does not directly combine multiple graphs into a graph, but first obtains their own low-dimensional representation matrices, and then uses self-expressiveness property of data to obtain the self-representation matrices of all the low-dimensional representations and removes noise simultaneously. In addition, by using the tensor low-rank constraint, i.e., tensor nuclear norm constraint, LFS/MGNMF can explore higher-order information among different self-representation matrices. Finally, LFS/MGNMF fuses the self-representation matrices for clustering. Therefore, we believe the proposed method is a late fusion scheme and can make full use of the multi-graph information. As far as we know, LFS/MGNMF is the first late fusion method for multi-graph regularized methods. The Augmented Lagrange Multiplier method is exploited to solve LFS/MGNMF, and the experimental results on four datasets are very promising and fully demonstrate the superiority of LFS/MGNMF.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The analysis of time series is becoming ever more popular due to the proliferation of sensors. A well-known similarity measure for time-series is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which does not respect the axioms of a metric. These, however, can be reintroduced through Learning DTW-Preserving Shapelets (LDPS). This article extends LDPS and presents constrained DTW-preserving shapelets (CDPS). CDPS directs the time-series repre-sentation to captures the user's interpretation of the data by considering a limited amount of user knowledge in the from of must-link-cannot link constraints. Subsequently, unconstrained algorithms can be used to generate a clustering that respects the constraints without explicit knowledge of them. Out-of-sample data can be trans-formed into this space, overcoming the limitations of traditional transductive constrained-clustering algorithms. Furthermore, several Shapelet Cluster Explanation (SCE) approaches are proposed that explain the clustering and can simplify the representation while preserving clustering performance. State-of-the-art performance is demonstrated on multiple time-series datasets and an open-source implementation will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TI Multi-proxy feature learning for robust fine-grained visual recognition
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Fine-grained visual recognition; Noisy label; Long tail; Proxy learning
AB Visual representation for fine-grained visual recognition can be learned by mandatorily enforcing all samples of the same category into a uniform representation. This strict training objective performs well under closed-set setting but is not applicable to data in the wild containing noisy annotations and long-tailed distributions, e. g., it may lead to a feature space biased to head categories. This paper tackles this challenge by pursuing a more balanced and discriminative feature space by first retaining intra-class variances to isolate noises, then eliminating intra-class variances to improve the visual recognition performance. We propose the Compact Memory Updater to maintain a memory bank, which memorizes proxy features to represent multiple typical appearances of each category in the training set. The Proxy-based Feature Enhancement hence leverages proxy features to ensure samples of the same category have similar features. Iteratively running those two modules boosts the robustness and discriminative power of the learnt representation, hence facilitates various fine-grained visual recognition tasks including person re-identification (re-id), image classification and retrieval. Extensive experiments on noisy and long-tailed training sets show this Multi-Proxy Feature Learning (MPFL) framework achieves promising performance. For instance on a training set with 90% one-shot categories, MPFL outperforms the recent long-tailed person re-id method LEAP-AF by 16.9% in rank-1 accuracy.

AB This paper presents a novel, fast and privacy preserving implementation of deep autoencoders. DAEF (Deep AutoEncoder for Federated learning), unlike traditional neural networks, trains a deep autoencoder network in a non-iterative way, which drastically reduces training time. Training can be performed incrementally, in parallel and distributed and, thanks to its mathematical formulation, the information to be exchanged does not endanger the privacy of the training data. The method has been evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art autoencoders, showing interesting results in terms of accuracy, speed and use of available resources. This makes DAEF a valid method for edge computing and federated learning, in addition to other classic machine learning scenarios.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DT Article
DE Music Streaming Services; Mobility Patterns; Spotify; Prediction
AB Nowadays, music streaming services allow users to get instant access to an unprecedented amount of music of any type. This entails that songs, including potential new hits, can be discovered by listeners in any part of the globe and their propagation can be tracked through these streaming services. In this context, the present work focuses on recognizing the mobility patterns that songs follow in such a propagation among different countries of the world. To this end, this work defines a novel mechanism to uncover such mobility patterns of music from a directed-graph structure where nodes are countries and each edge reflects a frequent propagation of songs between pairs of countries. The resulting patterns reflect strong correlations with the migratory flows and the cultural and social similarities among regions. For instance, a propagation pattern was observed among North European countries with a good command of English. From such patterns, potential predictors for anticipating the mobility of a song are discussed. The results of this work can be beneficial for record companies and artists in their marketing campaigns for album releases and the organization of concerts and festivals.

AB In this work, a swarming computational procedure is presented for the numerical treatment of the dynamical model of the susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) classes that portrayed the spreading of Zika virus. The artificial neural network procedures (ANNPs) have been applied to solve the SEIR mathematical model for spreading of the Zika virus together with the hybridization efficiency of global swarming and local search schemes. The global particle swarm optimization (PSO) and local search active-set algorithm (ASA) have been proposed to solve the model. An error based objective function is presented for the SEIR differential model and then optimized by the hybrid computing efficiency of PSO-ASA. Five neurons, fifteen variables of each class and ten numbers of trials have been used to solve the SEIR mathematical model for spreading of the Zika virus. The correctness of the proposed computing ANNPs-PSO-ASA is observed by using the comparison of the obtained and reference solutions along with the performances of the absolute error, ranges around 10-06 to 10-08. The reli-ability of the designed computing ANNPs-PSO-ASA technique is observed by using the statistical operator per-formances on single/multiple trials for the SEIR system for spreading of the Zika virus dynamics.

ID IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL-REALITY; BRAIN; MATRICES
AB Covariance matrix learning methods have become popular for many classification tasks owing to their ability to capture interesting structures in non-linear data while respecting the Riemannian geometry of the underlying symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. Several deep learning architectures ap-plied to these matrix learning methods have recently been proposed in classification tasks by learning discriminative Euclidean-based embeddings. In this paper, we propose a new Riemannian-based deep learning network to generate more discriminative features for electroencephalogram (EEG) classification. Our key innovation lies in learning the Riemannian barycenter for each class within a Riemannian geo-metric space. The proposed model normalizes the distribution of SPD matrices , learns the center of each class to penalize the distances between the matrix and the corresponding class centers. As a re-sult, our framework can further simultaneously reduce the intra-class distances, enlarge the inter-class distances for the learned features , consistently outperform other state-of-the-art methods on three widely used EEG datasets and the data from our stress-induced experiment in virtual reality. Experimen-tal results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework for learning the non-stationary nature of EEG signals due to the robustness of the covariance descriptor and the benefits of considering the barycenters on the Riemannian geometry. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In reality, influenced by fuzzy information and irrational behavior, decision-makers are typically difficult to make decisions. Therefore, how to comprehensively express the evaluation information and accurately quantify the psychological behavior becomes a primary key to improve the efficiency of decision-making. Aiming at multi-attribute decision-making problem with completely unknown weight information and Pythagorean hesitate fuzzy evaluation value, a VIKOR method based on regret theory is proposed. Firstly, the weights are determined from two levels of alternative and attribute. Secondly, the relative closeness decision matrix is constructed by TOPSIS method. Then, the VIKOR method is used to calculate the values of group utility and individual regret based on regret perception value, which can describe the ranking of alternatives. Finally, the availability and effectiveness of this method are proved by sensitivity and comparative analysis. In conclusion, the proposed method not only considers the compromise preference under Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy environment, but also takes into account regret psychologic behavior of decision-makers.

AB An Intuitionistic Fuzzy -Combined Weight -Mahalanobis distance -Multiple Attribute Decision Making (IFCM-MADM) method is proposed to solve comprehensive evaluation problem of the pollution control technologies for non-point sources in planting industry. The method is able to achieve cooperative improvement of the traditional TOPSIS on quantitative transformation of qualitative data in the evaluation indices by integrated intuitionistic fuzzy theory, subjective-objective combination weight calculation for the evaluation indicators by coupling the AHP and entropy weighting method, and accurately calculation on the distance between the evaluation object and the positive/negative solution by introducing the Mahalanobis distance to avoid the impact of correlation between indicators. Then, 34 typical technologies for agricultural non-point source pollution control selected from Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (MSTPWPCT) in China are employed for case application and validation, and the evaluation result obtained by IFCM-MADM has been deeply analyzed by comparing with the recommendation technologies provided by MSTPWPCT and the other two evaluation methods. The result shows that, the IFCM-MADM method can provide a scientific evaluation and selection of the technologies with high comprehensive benefits (including economic benefits, environmental benefits, and technical performance), which is highly consistent with the recommendation result from MSTPWPCT, and is capable to weaken the disadvantage of the objective weighting method and subjective weighting method, to a certain extent. The proposal of IFCM-MADM is the first attempt to enhance the traditional TOPSIS by extending its abilities on quantitative data processing, index weight calculation and accurate calcu-lation of relative closeness, concurrently, and the method is also appropriate to other practical environmental evaluation problems with high complexity and multiple attributes.

   Thermal information supplementary module; Multilayer decoding
AB Crowd counting is a fundamental and challenging task that requires rich information to generate a pixel-level crowd density map. Additionally, the development of thermal sensing and its applicability to computer vision has enabled the use of thermal information for crowd counting. Considering the complementary characteristics of RGB (red-green-blue) and thermal images in different feature encoding stages, we propose a cross-modality grade interaction network (CGINet) for RGB-T (RGB and thermal) crowd counting. We introduce an RGB cooperative enhancement module for thermal information to correctly extract low-level features from scenes containing objects with different scales. As RGB information is sensitive to lighting and occlusion while extracting high-level features, we propose a thermal information supplementary module to increase the RGB feature robustness. In addition, a novel multilayer decoding module fully integrates features at different levels, exploits the features of different layers, and predicts the crowd density map. Results from comprehensive experiments on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CGINet for RGB-T crowd counting. In addition, CGINet achieves excellent results on the ShanghaiTechRGB dataset containing paired RGB images and depth maps. The experimental results highlight the advanced architecture and generalization ability of CGINet for multimodality crowd counting.

AB The complexity of modern power systems has risen due to the growing demand for electricity. To mitigate this problem, the role of the electric utility in supplying safe and reliable electricity has become increasingly crucial. Low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) in a power system are an inevitable aspect. Therefore, the reliability of the system requires appropriate damping to overcome these LFOs. This paper proposes a novel design methodology for a fractional-order power system stabilizer (FO-PSS) to enhance the stability of the power system network. FO-PSS is designed to effectively dampen LFOs in both single-machine infinite bus systems (SMIB) and multi -machine power systems (MMPS). Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to predict the parameters of proposed PSSs. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed PSS, various test cases are considered. The results are compared to those obtained from traditional PSSs and optimization based PSSs. The effectiveness of the proposed RNN-based FO-PSS is demonstrated under diverse loading conditions.

AB Operating rooms (ORs) are one of the most stressful and complex work environments, and the surgical staff are highly exposed to ergonomic problems. In addition, the satisfaction of the surgical staff is directly affected by these factors. In this paper, an integrated intelligent algorithm is introduced to evaluate the performance of ORs based on ergonomics indicators, quantitatively and qualitatively and to examine the impact of these indicators on job satisfaction. Initially, the required data was collected by distributing a standard questionnaire covering items associated with ergonomics and job satisfaction among the surgical staff of a mega-hospital. The study benefited from a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and statistical methods to calculate the efficiency scores for each decision-making unit (DMU). The data envelopment analysis (DEA) method was used to validate the proposed algorithm. Afterward, sensitivity analysis and statistical tests were performed to evaluate the appropriateness of OR performance based on each of the ergonomics indicators. The results reveal that OR performance was appropriate based on knowledge, situation assessment, and situation analysis (KSS), specifications of work and equipment (SW), and mental power (MP). However, it was inappropriate in terms of information and communication system (IC), teamwork and effective communication (TE), physical condition (PC), and OR condition (OC).

AB The technique of error-correcting output codes (ECOC) has been proven to be of high discriminative ability in many classification applications. However, most algorithms on the ECOC were designed based on the binary or ternary codes (referred to as the hard codes), which might fail to precisely correct errors in dealing with tough tasks. In this study, a Soft-Recoding strategy based on a self-adaptive algorithm is proposed, which replaces the traditional hard codes with the real-value elements to better fit the output distribution of the base learners. This is achieved by minimizing the ratio of two distances: the distance of the output vector to the ground-truth class, and the average distance of the output vector to the remaining classes. Extensive experiments using five different hard ECOC algorithms and the corresponding softened versions on twenty datasets with diversified numbers of features and classes confirm the effectiveness of our Soft-Recoding strategy in promoting the performance of the original ECOC algorithms. Our source code and additional results are available at: github.com/MLDMXM2017/ SA-soft-recoding.

AB Background: Early diagnosis of brain diseases is very important. Brain disease classification is a common and complex topic in biomedical engineering. Therefore, machine learning methods are the most reliable and common methods for the automatic detection of brain diseases.Materials and methods: The brain diseases dataset consists of four classes: atrophy, normal, white matter density, and ischemia. First, data augmentation and normalization is applied to the dataset. Then, deep feature extraction is applied to this preprocessed dataset with the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) method. Deep feature data are given as input to the generator unit of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) method. Finally, classification is performed by Tree, Linear discriminant, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ensemble, Neural Network classifiers and K-mean.Results: In the classification applied before feature extraction with the RBM method, the highest accuracy is calculated in the SVM classifier with 97.94%, and the lowest accuracy is calculated in the Naive Bayes classifier with 80.43%. After applying the RBM feature extraction, the highest accuracy is calculated as 99.65% in the SVM classifier and 83.74% in the lowest Naive Bayes classifier.Conclusion: This study shows that the performance criteria values of the presented methods is improved with RBM-GAN.

AB Although quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm has the advantages of few pa-rameters and simple implementation, it suffers from these problems of low precision while calculating high-dimensional complex problems and being caught in local optimum during the later stage of iteration. To tackle these shortages effectively, a modified QPSO (QDQPSO) algorithm is presented. In order to improve the search efficiency and convergence speed of the algorithm, the idea of quasi opposite-based learning is used in the initialization stage. For enhancing the overall performance of the algorithm, the double evolutionary mechanism is applied to update the individual location during the iterative process. Furthermore, perturbation at global optimum position and bound constraint handling are considered to help the algorithm to escape from local optimum and maintain the diversity of population. According to the results obtained by QDQPSO and other nine optimization algorithms on 28 benchmark functions under different dimensions, it is found that QDQPSO performs better on the accuracy and stability of the optimal solution. Subsequently, Wilcoxon rank -sum test and Friedman test demonstrate significant advantages of the improved algorithm. Finally, QDQPSO algorithm displays superior performance in solving five practical optimization problems compared to several optimization methods.

AB Accurate monitoring of water quality is of great importance, especially in arid and semi-arid countries such as Iran. The Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) plays quite a significant role in rivers water quality. In most studies sampling isn't considered due to difficulty of measuring elements its time-consuming and expensive nature. Herein several hybrid models including SVM-CA, SVM-HS and SVM-TLBO were developed to predict TDS in Babolrood River, Iran. The monthly measured and unpublished data of Ca, Mg, HCO3, Na, SO4, Cl, pH, and TDS, from 1968 to 2016 were used. Based on Shannon's entropy and correlation matrix approaches most influential inputs were identified in five scenarios. Results were analyzed using several statistical indicators, including SI, MAE, U95, R2, RMSE and Taylor diagram. SVM-TLBO5 model improved MAE by 66% and 81% compared to LS-SVR1 model at Quran-Talar and Koushtargah stations, respectively. Based on SI, SVM-TLBO5 model improved predictions 87% and 79% compared to LS-SVR1 at Quran-Talar and Koushtargah stations. RMSE, MAE, SI, R2, U95, and T-STAT at Quran-Talar station obtained equal 10.1 mg/l, 0.022, 35.14, 10.22 mg/l, 0.022 and 33.59. Also, the same values for the Koushtargah station obtained equal to 6.73 mg/l, 0.993, 1.56, 4.51 mg/l, 0.997 and 0.674.

AB COVID-19 is a huge global challenge, on which numerous people and resources all over the world have been focused over the last three years to slow down its spread. A screening scale for the early detection of COVID-19 cases is highly important to diagnose patients before they transmit the disease to others. Using the data collected from Sept. 2020 to Nov. 2020 from 12,123 employees of a company including a weekly self-report questionnaire and information on their demographics, chronic disease, work, and commute, we developed a short, optimized screening scale for the early detection of COVID-19. To develop the scale, we have modified an interpretable machine learning (ML) method which uses integer programming techniques, and consequently reduced its computational cost significantly and made it robust to erroneous data and protective of sensitive information without loss of performance. The developed scale is highly interpretable and easily scored to the extent that it does not require a computer or even a calculator. However, we showed that the operating characteristics of the screening scale on the test dataset are excellent (area under the ROC curve = 82% and area under the Precision-Recall curve = 27%) and comparable to other well-known ML models such as penalized logistic regression and random forest when predicting positive PCR test results within 7 days from the date the self-report questionnaire was filled out. From Dec. 2020 to Nov. 2021, the developed scale has been used in the company weekly to monitor and assess its employees. Although different variants of COVID-19 have emerged since the development of the scale, the results show that the scale has performed well in the early detection of COVID-19, which helped the company take appropriate actions to slow down the spread of COVID-19 among its employees successfully. We expect our findings in this paper to help researchers have a better understanding of COVID-19 and control the spread of the disease.

AB The extraction of opinions and their corresponding targets has gained significant interest recently, as it offers valuable insights into Opinion Mining (OM) at a granular level. Opinion and target terms to be extracted by existing OM tasks need to be explicitly present in reviews. Targets that are not present but implied in contextual semantics, are neglected by existing OM tasks, even though an investigation reported that about 60% of reviews contain implicit targets. To enable implicit target extraction, a novel task named Mining Opinions towards Implicit Targets (MOIT) under the fine-grained OM, is proposed to extract both opinions and their corresponding implicit targets, enabling a more comprehensive analysis of reviews. To set up the basis for follow-up research on MOIT, two large-scale datasets were constructed as resources in two languages, where the Chinese dataset was built from scratch via a standard human annotation process, and the English dataset was built semi-automatically through machine translation and manual checking. Furthermore, three baseline models adapting three representative paradigms of information extraction, namely sequence labeling, question answering, and text generation, were proposed to solve MOIT. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the models. The proposed MOIT task extends the field of OM research, and the datasets and models establish a foundation for future studies in this area.

AB Imaging nanoscale radiation-induced defects using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) is a key factor in the successful implementation of materials for nuclear energy structural applications. Analyzing each defect in a TEM micrograph is currently a manual task. To identify the defects in a single image can take anywhere from 15 min to an hour and a project can require the analysis of anywhere from tens to & GE; 100 images. Here, we use artificial intelligence (AI) models to automate this task. For simplification, we evaluated images with only a single type of defect; helium bubbles. We performed semantic segmentation of these helium bubble defects in electron microscopy images of irradiated FeCrAl alloys using a deep learning DefectSegNet model. This model, which was previously used to classify crystal defects, is inspired by the classic DenseNet and U-Net image segmentation models. It claims high spatial resolution, but has poor performance at object boundaries. Our paper improves the DefectSegNet model's application by adding two new features. First, the DefectSegNet model is applied not only to perform calculation pixel-wise but also object (or feature) wise. Because object -wise metrics are directly relevant to our final goal of detecting bubbles, whereas pixel-wise classification is only an intermediate step, it is an important part of our study. Second, a distance map loss (DML) function has been added to increase its performance at object boundaries. It is crucial to accurately represent defects boundaries, especially bubbles, in order to track the bubble-induced swelling caused by irradiation. The boundary-focused DML function is also compared to other loss functions like Cross-entropy, Weighted Binary Cross Entropy (WBCE), Dice and Intersection over Union (IOU). Finally, by incorporating new features, we found a marked improvement on segmentation quality and better shape preservation at the boundaries and areas of the bubbles.

AB Reliable frequency regulation of power systems integrated with low-inertia variable renewable energy gen-erations (REGs) is crucial in islanded mode operation. It demands a resilient control framework to uphold grid stability/security against undeniable physical disturbances/cyber-attacks. This work maidenly develops and applies a fuzzy disturbance observer (FDO)-based resilient frequency controller to advance the dynamic stability of REGs-integrated large-scale power plants. Further, to enhance the damping of frequency/power oscillations, hydrogen energy storage (HES) has been incorporated, and its effectiveness is analyzed. The estimated disturbance using FDO is augmented into secondary control law derived from a non-singular terminal sliding mode strategy to increase active disturbance rejection proficiency of the overall closed-loop system. The global exponential finite-time stability of the testbed under the developed control framework has been rigorously reviewed using the Lyapunov theory. The qualitative assessment of simulation outcomes has confirmed the proficiency and resiliency of the developed control framework regarding superior frequency regulation against unknown disturbance inputs. The practicability of the developed control framework has been further quantified on IEEE 68-bus large-scale testbed, and a comparative study is presented following unknown/uncertain disturbances. Lastly, the cyber-tolerance of the applied resilient controller has been established against detectable DoS cyber-attack.

AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) system for oil field production, oil-well pump leakage is one of the most challenging faults to detect. Once the pump leakage fault occurs, it will severely impact crude oil production. Therefore, accurate diagnosis of oil-well pump leakage faults is highly necessary. However, achieving accurate diagnosis through existing artificial intelligence methods remains a challenge due to the prolonged and progressive nature of oil-well pump leakage faults. This paper proposes a novel methodology for diagnosing oil-well pump leakage. Specifically, we propose a time-series data transformation method that ingeniously transforms difficult-to-identify pump leakage long time-series data variation features into image pixel-level texture features, and based on the characteristics of differences in image texture features under different states, we propose the structure of convolutional residual blocks with attributes and spatial attention for oil-well pump leakage fault diagnosis, which enables more accurate fault diagnosis by assigning more attention weights to extract valuable fault information. Through extensive experimentation, we found that the diagnosis process proposed in this paper outperforms sequence models such as LSTM and GRU, achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 98.36% for oil-well pump leakage faults. Moreover, it leads to a significant improvement of 19.40% and 10.36% in accuracy compared to conventional CNN and ResNet models, respectively. Therefore, in the actual production of oilfields, this method can effectively meet the detection requirements for oil-well pump leakage.

ID ACCESSIBILITY
AB Interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets play a significant role in modelling decision-making problems with incomplete information more accurately than intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Various decision-making methods have been introduced for the different classes IFSs. In this study, we aim to introduce a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method which suits the decision-making problems modelled under the IVFFS environment well and study its applications in the adoption of energy consumption in Urban mobility considering digital carbon footprint. The proposed method considers the importance and performance of one alternative with respect to all others, which is not the case with many available decision making algorithms introduced in the literature. Transportation is one of the most significant sources of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous potential remedies are proposed to reduce the quantity of GHG generated by transportation activities, including regulatory measures and public transit digitalization initiatives. Decision-makers, however, should consider the digital carbon footprint of such projects. This study proposes three alternatives for reducing GHG emissions from transportation activities: incremental adoption of digital technologies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases, disruptive digitalization technologies in urban mobility, and redesign of urban mobility using regulatory approaches and economic instruments. The proposed novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method will be utilized to rank these alternative projects in order of advantage. First, the problem is converted into a multi-criterion group decision making problem. Then a novel two-phase interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy dominance method is designed and developed to rank the alternatives. The importance and advantage of the proposed two-phase method over other existing methods are discussed by using sensitivity and comparative analysis. The results indicate that rethinking urban mobility through governmental policies and economic tools is the least advantageous choice, while incremental adoption of digital technologies is the most advantageous.

AB This paper proposes a spatiotemporal graph neural network capable of effective representation learning of the spatiotemporal interrelationships and interdependencies of in-situ observation data from multiple locations for multivariate multi-step ahead time-series forecasting. The propose model is largely composed of graph learning, spatial encoder, and temporal decoder, and ablation studies on variants of the three modules and comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep neural networks for sequence modeling were also performed extensively. The proposed model showed improved predictability than conventional numerical model-based approaches or state-of-the-art models by applying consecutive multi-step ahead time-series prediction of sea surface temperature at multiple locations along the coast. For more rigorous performance evaluation, not only the overall performance of the test data, but also the performance of extreme cases included in the test data based on historical records were separately assessed. The prediction rationales were also presented through quantified relative contributions between neighbor locations using the trained adjacency matrix obtained through graph learning. The results showed that it is well consistent with the ocean physics and geographical domain knowledge, demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed method. Therefore, the proposed method shows sufficient potential to be used as a scientific tool for decision-making in extreme events such as marine heat waves or for operational ocean forecasting.

AB Currently, the primary focus of 3D point-based detectors is to enhance their performance by primarily increasing the recall rate of foreground points at the semantic level. However, this approach is suboptimal. On one hand, ground-truth annotations of 3D bounding boxes are inherently ambiguous due to occlusions, signal distortion, or manual annotation errors, which can obscure genuine semantic information. On the other hand, the saliency of each point varies. In this paper, we propose SPSNet based on Bayes theorem to explore the mapping relationship between the sampled point and the corresponding bounding box, which we call point stability. This is a plug-and-play module and used as the basis for downsampling instead of relying on semantic information obtained through hard supervision of 3D bounding boxes. We incorporate the proposed method into the most popular point-based detector, IA-SSD, called SPSNet-IA. On the challenging KITTI validation set, with only changes to the downsampling strategy, it obtains 1.18, 2.78 and 2.96 gains for the metric of AP3D on the easy, moderate and hard levels, respectively. In addition, SPSNet-IA outperforms all published point based approaches by a large margin and ranks 1st among single-modal methods. We also design qualitative and quantitative experiments to explain the meaning of stability learned from SPSNet. These additional experiments demonstrate that SPSNet is not only a performance-enhancing model but also a saliency analysis model. The code is available at https://github.com/AlanLiangC/SPSNet.git.

AB Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is helpful to control potential risks of enterprises by ranking failure modes based on their evaluation values regarding multiple risk factors. However, due to the cognitive limitation of experts, obtaining explicit evaluation of failure modes is difficult; in addition, existing literature on FMEA rarely considered interactions between risk factors. To bridge these research gaps, this paper proposes an outranking-based hesitant fuzzy linguistic FMEA method. Firstly, inspired by the PROMETHEE-II and the best-worst method, the outranking relation between each failure mode and the best or the worst failure mode is determined, so as to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons. Also, the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set is used to express the ambiguity of expert judgments regarding the comparisons of failure modes. The Choquet integral is applied to integrate the scores of risk factors considering their interactions. Finally, the proposed method is implemented in an example of food cold chain risk assessment. Results shows that failure modes with high risks are the illness of cold chain workers, product loss and long-time transportation. This study contributes theories about managing ranking efficiency of failure modes in FMEA under fuzzy evaluation environment with interactive risk factors when addressing food cold chain risk evaluation problems.

AB Deep-learning-based identification and diagnosis of faults in industrial assets has received much attention. It does not need a deep understanding of the target domain or complex signal-processing techniques for time-consuming feature identification and selection. The vast majority of approaches developed in this field rely on public data recorded in laboratory conditions with high-performance measurement equipment. Moreover, primarily vibration data is used for condition monitoring tasks, which is particularly sensitive to typical error patterns in rotating machinery. These conditions are difficult to maintain in industrial environments since using high-performance measurement systems would not be economically feasible. This paper demonstrates that modern deep learning can achieve extraordinary fault detection results with industrial standard low-cost measurement systems. We determine measurements taken from the industrial-sensory equipment that poten-tially capture the system's fault patterns. Hereafter, we apply traditional failure detection and identification techniques to evaluate the suitability of the taken measurements for bearing fault detection. These techniques apply envelope analysis to reveal the fault patterns in the signals and a support vector machine to separate the fault classes. We can conclude that the used low-cost sensory equipment is capable to capture meaningful, fault-describing patterns. To improve the failure detection performance we are investigating a 2D, as well as 1D, convolutional neural network approach to identify the error patterns and classify the respective errors. We compare the deep-learning-based methods with the traditional methods. Furthermore, we assess which inverter signal carries the largest fault-describing information content. Experimental results indicate that the proposed deep learning methods outperform traditional fault diagnosis methods, hence, demonstrating the effectiveness in an industrial condition monitoring application.

AB The complex internal structure and heterogeneous composition material of aerospace equipment make it difficult to apply traditional acoustic emission source localization methods to the loose particle localization research. In previous studies, the authors transformed the loose particle localization problem into the multi -classification problem in machine learning, trained the loose particle localization model, but there were problems of low classification accuracy and low practicality. In this paper, the authors first introduced the ensemble learning idea into the loose particle detection field, designed a complete loose particle localization scheme, analyzed the above problems from multiple perspectives, and proposed new algorithms or strategies to enhance the superiority and practicability of the loose particle localization model. Specifically, in view of the low classification accuracy, the authors carried out the research on pulse preprocessing, feature engineering and model training from the four perspectives of signal, feature, data set and classifier, respectively. The zero -pulse-filling pulse matching algorithm and the channel-weighting-based feature selection method was newly proposed, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients features was newly extracted, feature optimization scheme was designed, and XGBoost ensemble classifier was trained. Thus, high-quality loose particle signals, high-quality localization data sets and high-performance loose particle localization models were obtained, respectively. Test results show that, the classification accuracy achieved by the new loose particle localization model was 96.80%, which was a significant improvement compared to the 83.53% achieved in previous studies. In view of the low practicality, the authors built the loose particle localization experimental system, gave the specific implementation steps of the loose particle localization method, as well as the general procedures for applying the loose particle localization model for physical testing. Meanwhile, taking into account the requirements of aerospace engineering applications, the authors added the majority voting strategy to convert classification results into localization results, thus newly proposed the definition of equipment-level loose particle localization accuracy. Several physical testing results show that, the loose particle localization model achieved a localization accuracy of 90.91%, which effectively verified the feasibility and stability of the proposed method. This study is an important supplement to the loose particle detection research, and of great significance in improving the reliability of aerospace systems.

ID TEXT CATEGORIZATION; MATRIX COMPLETION; CLASSIFICATION
AB The relationship between features and labels plays an important role in multi-label learning. The purpose of multi-label learning is to learn a mapping from the feature space to the label space. Many of the existing methods decompose the observed label matrix into the product of a low-rank latent label matrix and a projection matrix, and construct a linear mapping between the feature space and low-rank latent label space. However, in practice, the relationship between two high-dimensional spaces is often nonlinear. Consequently, these linear models may not sufficiently capture the data distribution and the true dependencies between features and labels. Herein, a novel classification model for multi-label learning is proposed, which considers nonlinear mapping from the feature space to the latent label space. Because of correlation between labels, the label matrix is usually of a low rank. To explore the low-rank structure, a latent label matrix is obtained using the decomposition of the original label matrix. To characterize the nonlinear relationship between features and latent labels, the tanh function is employed to learn a nonlinear classifier. The tanh function describes the distribution of labels by constraining the domain of the latent label space to the interval [-1,1]. In addition, the Frobenius norm regularization constraint is imposed on the variables in the model for optimization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and comparable to state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods.

AB Addressing price forecasting problems is an important exercise to policymakers and market participants in the resource business sector. In this work, we build Gaussian process regression models through cross validation and Bayesian optimizations over different kernels and basis functions for daily price index forecasting of ten major steel products in the Chinese market during July 20, 2011-April 15, 2021. This study aims to be the first attempt of exploring potential of Gaussian process regressions for price forecasting exercises with the coverage of all of the ten most important steel products that carry enormous economic significance in China as the largest steel consumer and producer in the world. The models offer accurate out-of-sample forecasts for the two-year period of April 16, 2019-April 15, 2021 with relative root mean square errors ranging from 0.07404% to 0.22379% across the ten price indices and correlation coefficients above 99.9%. They also lead to better forecast performance than some traditional econometric models and some other machine learning models as benchmarks. The models constructed here could be utilized by policymakers as part of policy design and implementations and by market participants as part of market assessments and decision making.

AB As the "heart" of high-speed train, traction systems play an important role in the safe operation of trains, of which the operation and maintenance level is still unable to meet the needs of modern railway transportation. Fortunately, multifarious advanced fault prognosis methods have been developed to deal with the dilemma. Among them, deep learning ones have received special attention due to their unique advantages. This paper first reveals the structural characteristics of traction systems in high-speed trains. Then, various representative deep learning based prognosis methods are compared and summarized, focusing on the analysis of their pros and cons. Finally, we point out the challenges and speculate the future trends in this field. This paper may serve as a referee for the interested researchers in fault prognosis and high-speed train traction systems fields, along with the potential directions.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being utilized in a wide range of sophisticated applications, but the outcomes of many AI models are challenging to comprehend and trust due to their black-box nature. Usually, it is essential to understand the reasoning behind an AI mode ľs decision-making. Thus, the need for eXplainable AI (XAI) methods for improving trust in AI models has arisen. XAI has become a popular research subject within the AI field in recent years. Existing survey papers have tackled the concepts of XAI, its general terms, and post-hoc explainability methods but there have not been any reviews that have looked at the assessment methods, available tools, XAI datasets, and other related aspects. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, we provide readers with an overview of the current research and trends in this rapidly emerging area with a case study example. The study starts by explaining the background of XAI, common definitions, and summarizing recently proposed techniques in XAI for supervised machine learning. The review divides XAI techniques into four axes using a hierarchical categorization system: (i) data explainability, (ii) model explainability, (iii) post-hoc explainability, and (iv) assessment of explanations. We also introduce available evaluation metrics as well as open-source packages and datasets with future research directions. Then, the significance of explainability in terms of legal demands, user viewpoints, and application orientation is outlined, termed as XAI concerns. This paper advocates for tailoring explanation content to specific user types. An examination of XAI techniques and evaluation was conducted by looking at 410 critical articles, published between January 2016 and October 2022, in reputed journals and using a wide range of research databases as a source of information. The article is aimed at XAI researchers who are interested in making their AI models more trustworthy, as well as towards researchers from other disciplines who are looking for effective XAI methods to complete tasks with confidence while communicating meaning from data.

AB Assessing project portfolio risk (PPR) is essential for organizations to grasp the overall risk levels of project portfolios (PPs) and realize PPR mitigation. However, current research is inadequate to effectively assess PPR, which brings challenges to managing PPR. In this context, the purpose of this study is to develop a PPR assessment model via an enhanced backpropagation neural network (BPNN). First, PPR assessment criteria considering project interdependencies are determined. Second, fuzzy logic is used to obtain original data for assessment criteria. Principal component analysis (PCA) is then employed to reduce the dimensionality of assessment criteria and derive the input and output of BPNN. Third, an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) is designed to optimize the initial weights and thresholds of BPNN. On this basis, the PCA-IGA-BPNN assessment model is constructed, followed by training and testing, possessing a test accuracy of 98.6%. Finally, comparison experiments are conducted from both internal and external perspectives. For internal comparison, the proposed model yields less mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) than PCA-GA-BPNN, IGA-BPNN, PCA-BPNN and BPNN and offers the largest convergence speed (). As for external comparison, the presented model produces lower MAPE, MSE, and RMSE than Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and has the largest coefficient of determination (R2). Results indicate that the established model performs more satisfactorily in assessing PPR. This research enriches PPR assessment methods and provides managers with a useful tool to evaluate PPR.

AB Abstaining models have been widely used in safety-critical fields to avoid uncertain classification and reduce misclassification costs. Previous abstaining models have two main disadvantages. First, the costs of classification and rejection need to be set. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain or estimate costs in practical applications. When costs change, the trained model will be no longer applicable. Second, a single indicator, such as the error rate or AUC, is optimized, which has poor robustness for different application requirements. To solve such problems, a dual objective bounded abstaining (DOBA) model is proposed. DOBA optimizes the binary confusion matrix with rejection by minimizing the false positive and negative rates under class-specific reject constraints. The DOBA model is solved using an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. The requirement-oriented abstaining classifier can be selected from a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness and superiority of DOBA compared to other abstaining models.

AB Hospital staff and resources allocation (HSRA) is a critical challenge in healthcare systems, as it involves balancing the demands of patients, the availability of resources, and the need to provide high-quality health in resource-bounded settings. Traditional approaches to HSRA have relied on manual planning and ad-hoc adjustments, which can be time-consuming and usually lead to sub-optimal outcomes. Recent studies show that machine learning solutions are able to produce better HSRA results compared to manual planning. However, these outcomes usually focused on a single hospital and objective. In this paper, we solve the HSRA task using a novel agent-based simulation with a deep reinforcement learning agent. We used real-world data to generate a wide range of synthetic instances that were used to train the HSRA agent. Our results show that the proposed model is able to achieve better outcomes in terms of patient treatment success and cost-effectiveness compared to previous resource allocation algorithms. We show that different planning horizons obtain similar performance in handling anomalies. In addition, we show a second-order polynomial connection between the patient treatment success and both the hospital's initial budget and funding over time. These results suggest that our approach has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HSRA in healthcare systems.

AB To build intelligent manufacturing systems that react flexibly in case of failures or unexpected circumstances, manufacturing capabilities of production systems must be utilized as much as possible. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, in particular, automated planning can contribute to this by enabling flexible production processes. To efficiently leverage automated planning, an almost complete planning domain description of the real -world is necessary. However, creating such planning descriptions is a demanding and error-prone task that requires high manual efforts even for domain experts. In addition, maintaining the encoded knowledge is laborious and, thus, can lead to outdated domain descriptions. To reduce the high efforts, already existing knowledge can be reused and transformed automatically into planning descriptions to benefit from organization-wide knowledge engineering activities. This paper presents a novel approach that reduces the described efforts by reusing existing knowledge for planning and scheduling in Industry 4.0 (I4.0). For this purpose, requirements for developing a converter that transforms existing knowledge are derived from literature. Based on these requirements, the SWS2PDDL converter is developed that transforms the knowledge into formal Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) descriptions. The approach's usefulness is verified by a practical evaluation with a near real-world application scenario by generating failures in a physical smart factory and evaluating the generated re-planned production processes. When comparing the resulting plan quality to those achieved by using a manually modeled planning domain by a domain expert, the automatic transformation by SWS2PDDL leads to comparable or even better results without requiring the otherwise high manual modeling efforts.

TI Haar wavelet downsampling: A simple but effective downsampling module
   for semantic segmentation

AB Downsampling operations such as max pooling or strided convolution are ubiquitously utilized in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to aggregate local features, enlarge receptive field, and minimize computational overhead. However, for a semantic segmentation task, pooling features over the local neighbourhood may result in the loss of important spatial information, which is conducive for pixel-wise predictions. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective pooling operation called the Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling (HWD) module. This module can be easily integrated into CNNs to enhance the performance of semantic segmentation models. The core idea of HWD is to apply Haar wavelet transform for reducing the spatial resolution of feature maps while preserving as much information as possible. Furthermore, to investigate the benefits of HWD, we propose a novel metric, named as feature entropy index (FEI), which measures the degree of information uncertainty after downsampling in CNNs. Specifically, the FEI can be used to indicate the ability of downsampling methods to preserve essential information in semantic segmentation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HWD module could (1) effectively improve the segmentation performance across different modality image datasets with various CNN architectures, and (2) efficiently reduce information uncertainty compared to the conventional downsampling methods. Our implementation are available at https:// github.com/apple1986/HWD.

AB Operations Research (OR) analytics play a crucial role in optimizing decision-making processes for real-world problems. The assignment problem, with applications in supply chains, healthcare logistics, and production scheduling, represents a prominent optimization challenge. This paper focuses on addressing the Generalized Quadratic Assignment Problem (GQAP), a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To tackle the GQAP, we propose an OR analytical approach that incorporates efficient relaxations, reformulations, heuristics, and a metaheuristic algorithm. Initially, we employ the Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) to generate various linear relaxation models, carefully selecting the most efficient ones. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a robust reformulation based on Benders Decomposition (BD), which serves as the basis for an iterative optimization algorithm applied to the GQAP. Furthermore, we develop a constructive heuristic algorithm to identify near-optimal solutions, followed by an enhancement utilizing an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic algorithm. This ALNS algorithm is enhanced through the integration of a tabu list derived from Tabu Search (TS) and a decision rule inspired by Simulated Annealing (SA). To validate our approach and evaluate its performance, we conduct a comparative analysis against state-of-the-art algorithms documented in the literature. This comparison confirms the significant improvements achieved in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency through our proposed methodology. These advancements contribute to the state of the art in solving the GQAP and hold the potential to enhance decision -making processes in a wide range of domains. Our methodology demonstrates remarkable improvements in solution quality and computational efficiency when compared to existing approaches, as evidenced by the comparative results with state-of-the-art algorithms. The potential implications of our research extend to optimizing decision-making processes in diverse fields, rendering it highly relevant and impactful.

AB Maintaining railway axles is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures and enormous human and economic costs. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the railway industry to adopt condition monitoring techniques to enhance the safety and efficiency of the rail transport system, which maintenance is currently based on periodic inspections. In this context, this work presents a technique for real-time crack diagnosis on railway axles, based on advanced 2D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures applied to time- frequency representations of vibration signals. One of the critical novelties is introducing a differential CNN structure that captures the system's statistical properties, enabling generalisation between different mechanical sets and conditions. The proposed system has been trained with data corresponding to a unique wheelset assembly, showing that the model is able to diagnose cracks on the three different wheelset tested in operation under 32 different combinations of conditions, such as load, speed, sense of rotation and vibration direction. Four different crack levels have been introduced, representing the maximum one a 0.08% of the axle diameter, and the method proposed achieved Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.85, significantly outperforming results obtained with other architectures proposed in the state-of-the-art, the score of the next below is 0.76. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of this approach to accurately classify the four crack levels tested within a condition monitoring system for non-stationary conditions, that would enable reliable real-time diagnosis, thus paving the way towards a more robust and efficient railway axle maintenance system.

AB Complex evidence theory (CET) is crucial in modeling uncertain information in the complex domain. With the development of the research on CET, how to measure the conflict between complex basic belief assignments (CBBAs) accurately remains an open issue. Thus, we propose the complex belief x2 divergence (called CBx2 divergence) tending to solve conflict management issues. The proposed complex belief x2 divergence which considers the quantum interference effects is a generalized model of traditional belief x2 divergence. Furthermore, the proposed complex belief x2 divergence satisfies the properties of symmetry, non-degeneracy and continuity. Besides, an algorithm for decision-making based on the complex belief x2 divergence is proposed. This method is applied in several datasets from UCI machine learning repository including the iris dataset, the seeds dataset and the heart disease dataset for pattern recognition. The result shows the proposed method has better classification accuracy compared with the related methods.

AB Classification of trees based on morphological parameters is important for identification, taxonomy, ecological research, conservation etc. The manual measurement of these parameters is tedious, laborious, and inconsistent. Even though there are many tree classification methods based on the morphological parameters available in the literature, there is hardly any research in classification of Coconut trees based on morphological parameters. This research proposes a novel hybrid fuzzy support vector machine approach for classification of Coconut trees based on three critical morphological parameters such as height, inclination, and orientation. A fuzzy logic-based parameter measurement from image is used to estimate critical morphological parameters the from the images. An original dataset of 17000 images of Indian west coast tall Coconut trees is created to train and test the proposed method. The classification for each of the three parameters is carried out separately using fuzzy logic and support vector machine and the best classification is chosen using confidence voting method. The final classification of the Coconut trees based on all the three parameters is obtained using weight-based indexing by combining the individual outcome of confidence voting method. The results showed that the proposed architecture gives better performance than state-of-the-art classifiers, with an accuracy of 88.86%. The statistical analysis showed that the proposed architecture is stable and robust than other methods, gives least confidence interval value of & PLUSMN;2.5, & PLUSMN;3.2, & PLUSMN;1.9 for three different datasets other than the original dataset.

AB This study addresses the challenge and related difficulties of controlling solar collector fields (SCFs) using high-complex models by proposing an adaptive optimal model-free controller based on the Reinforcement Q-Learning algorithm. The controller aims to achieve optimal performance using only plant measurements, particularly the working fluid temperature, flow rate, and reference trajectory. The proposed solution offers advantages over model-based controllers, as it can handle nonlinearities, time-varying model parameters, and computational costs associated with nonlinear models. Additionally, the Q-Learning algorithm requires a small amount of data, overcoming data-driven solutions presented in the literature till now for SCF systems. To ensure the controller performance, simulations are conducted using a validated SCF model based on actual data from the CIESOL thermal plant located in Almeria, Spain. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the model-free controller as the Q-Learning algorithm converges to the optimal gains of the Linear Quadratic Tracking (LQT) controller, exhibiting adaptive optimal response. Furthermore, the Q-Learning strategy outperforms the LQT controller in managing steady-state errors, particularly on sunny days with smooth solar irradiance variations. The average discrepancy in gains computed with reinforcement learning in a one-day campaign trial considering 18000 data is less than 15% compared to optimal LQT gains. This model-free approach proves its value and can easily be extended to different SCF systems without altering the general control formulation.

AB Semantic segmentation has a broad range of applications in a variety of domains including land coverage analysis, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) provide the architecture models for semantic segmentation. Even though ViTs have proven success in image classification, they cannot be directly applied to dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation and object detection since ViT is not a general purpose backbone due to its patch partitioning scheme. In this survey, we discuss some of the different ViT architectures that can be used for semantic segmentation and how their evolution managed the above-stated challenge. The rise of ViT and its performance with a high success rate motivated the community to slowly replace the traditional convolutional neural networks in various computer vision tasks. This survey aims to review and compare the performances of ViT architectures designed for semantic segmentation using benchmarking datasets. This will be worthwhile for the community to yield knowledge regarding the implementations carried out in semantic segmentation and to discover more efficient methodologies using ViTs.

AB Currently, most classification algorithms may suffer from serious misclassification when faced with unbalanced or new data, for lacking feedback and update capability. Many existing classification methods learn from the continuous learning mechanism in the biological immune system to realize the learning of new data. However, these methods in classifying new data, because of the lack of feedback, lead to a search for a long time, even may deviate from the correct results. Humans can make the immune response proceed to a certain extent as they wish through a variety of intervention techniques. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a continual learning classification method with human-in-the-loop (H-CLCM) based on the artificial immune system. H-CLCM adjusts parameters online corresponding to misidentified data by integrating human experience during the testing phase. This enables it not only to converge to an accurate prediction model at minimal cost but also to have the capability to learn new classes of data without retraining the classifier. Experiments on 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate the performances and advantages of the proposed method. The experimental results show that H-CLCM has superior classification performance than the other approaches under the same data.

AB Using medical science alongside time series data analysis can be given a strong tool to develop efficient decision support systems in Corona pandemic. In this regard, many hybrid learning-oriented (HL) approaches have been presented, which rely on modeling the linear and non-linear components of the time series. However, there is a lack of comprehensive study of such approaches to achieve a macro vision of Covid-19 data prediction models in an unified reference. We conducted a comparative analytical study on (HL) approaches for predicting Covid-19 data. The main scope of current study is the investigate of such approaches. The original contribution of the paper is to present a reference-point and roadmap for future studies, which is provided in three forms. First, we experimentally evaluated the efficiency of all learning-based combinations on types of Covid-19 data in a similar context. Second, we tried to provide a guidance for choosing a more proper hybrid through valid empirical and statistical evaluations. Third, we presented an efficient and generalizable approach called HL-ALL (Hybrid Learning ARIMA LSTM LSTM). Evaluation results show high potential of HL-ALL in dealing Covid-19 data when prediction.

AB In this study, an autonomous vehicle that can avoid obstacles has been developed by using stereo imaging systems and artificial intelligence applications together. An integrated stereo camera module and NVIDIA Jetson Nano developer kit were used as computer vision system. Checkerboard calibration was performed to prevent camera distortions. The images of the cameras were rectified and the difference costs between the left and right image pairs on the same epipolar plane were calculated. These difference costs were passed through the weighted least squares (WLS) filter, thus a depth map of the left camera image was created. The rectified left camera view was also processed by artificial intelligence-based semantic segmentation. Segmentation was carried out using a previously trained artificial intelligence network (SegNet). These semantic segmentation outputs were passed through the HSV color mask and a mask image was hereby obtained. Using the mask image; movable ground, obstacle, and background information was extracted. Useful data analysis was performed on the depth map and semantic segmentation outputs of the same frame. This information is transmitted to the 2-wheeled vehicle which is designed based on ROS that provides the movement, and decisions are made within the scope of the avoidance algorithm. This study's novel contribution involves the integration of a passive depth sensing system and artificial intelligence based semantic segmentation, in tandem with a real-time obstacle avoidance algorithm that utilizes these combined technologies. Consequently, the autonomous vehicle is capable of making semantic inferences about its environment while effectively avoiding obstacles.

ID KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS
AB The number of patents is constantly increasing, providing an invaluable knowledge base. But retrieving this knowledge becomes ever more challenging with the increase in data. In this context, this study proposes a patent recommendation method based on knowledge graph (KG) representation. Although KG based recommendation systems received broad attention in the literature, there is still a lack of literature that explores how it can be used for patent recommendations. First, and in terms of KG construction, the existing methods encounter issues when it comes to simultaneously accounting for accuracy and recall rate. This study proposes a combination of rule-based and deep learning methods for KG construction to solve this problem. Second, existing methods have performance and semantic association limitations when learning KG representations. This study therefore uses high-performance graph neural networks for encoding and models the semantic association limitations in graphs using traditional KG representation learning methods. Finally, existing recommendation systems usually focus on the semantic correlation between interaction items in recommendations, ignoring their direct relationships. This study therefore applies the KG representation learning method for the patent recommendation task, using KG representation learning to model the semantic association and constraints in the product-patent heterogeneous graph. Experiments based on a practical case example demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods, and that it can guide innovative design processes. Findings have important implications for research and practice.

ID ATTENTION
AB Recently, facial expression recognition (FER) methods have achieved significant progress. However, FER is still challenged by factors such as uneven illumination and low-quality expression images. Exploring the potential of facial expression features to achieve robust FER is particularly important. Inspired by the Transformer's excellent performance in modeling long-range dependencies and in vision tasks, this paper proposes a Transformer Block Enhancement Module (TBEM) for enhancing the feature representation of facial expressions. The proposed module contains a Channel Enhancement (CE) block and a Spatial Enhancement (SE) block. The CE block can adaptively enhance the expression features on the channel dimension by effectively leveraging the channel dependency information, while the SE block enhances the expression features on the spatial dimension by integrating the spatial dependency information. TBEM can output a more robust expression representation by combining CE and SE. The proposed artificial intelligence learning module greatly improves the recognition accuracy of FER engineering tasks. To further illustrate the application of TBEM in real-world FER engineering, three engineering problems are used for verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves FER performance by focusing on more accurate decisional features and can be easily embedded into regular convolutional neural network models to help them improve the accuracy on FER tasks by about 2.64%-3.03%. The results show the proposed method achieves accuracies of 90.57% on FERPlus, 89.41% on RAFDB basic and 68.43% on RAFDB compound, respectively. The proposed method also provides a meaningful reference for further research on applying Transformer to other tasks.

AB The aim of this paper is to develop a novel approach to product online ratings aggregation decision-making, which can provide method support for consumers to obtain useful decision-making knowledge and more credible product ranking results. First, the personalized characteristics contained in the information disclosed by rating individual user are mined to establish the credibility model supporting individual weight allocation, and the multi-level division mechanism is designed to propose the aggregation method of group ratings. Then, the intuitionistic fuzzy improved normalized Bonferroni mean with weighted interaction (IFINWIBM) operator is defined, which can apply to aggregate product multidimensional ratings. Moreover, driven by expert knowledge and large-scale ratings, the learning mechanism of operator parameters is designed to describe the degree of interaction between attributes, which can avoid the unscientific caused by subjectivity. We further develop an online multidimensional ratings aggregation decision-making model to solve the product ranking problem. Finally, a numerical example and comparative analysis are given to illustrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed method, which can reduce the interference of false groups on large-scale information aggregation and improve the rationality of attribute interaction coefficient acquisition.

AB Medical signal classification often focuses on one representation (raw signal or time frequency). In that context, recent works have shown the value of exploiting different representations simultaneously. We propose a regularized end-to-end trained model for classification in a medical context exploiting both the raw signal and a time-frequency representation (TFR). First, a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) encoder and a 1D CNN-transformer encoder start by extracting embedded representations from the TFR and the raw signal, respectively. Then, the obtained embeddings are fused to form a common latent space that is used for classification. We propose to guide the training of each encoder by applying two iterated losses. Moreover, we propose to regularize the fused common latent space using deep embedded clustering. Extensive experiments on three medical datasets and ablation studies show the adaptability and good performance of our method for medical signal classification. Our method makes it possible to improve the classification performance from 4% to 12% MCC on a transcranial Doppler dataset, when compared with single-feature counterparts, while giving more stable models.

AB Despite the remarkable success of deep learning, an optimal convolution operation on point clouds re-mains elusive owing to their irregular data structure. Existing methods mainly focus on designing an effective continuous kernel function that can handle an arbitrary point in continuous space. Various ap-proaches exhibiting high performance have been proposed, but we observe that the standard pointwise feature is represented by 1D channels and can become more informative when its representation in-volves additional spatial feature dimensions. In this paper, we present Multidimensional Kernel Convo-lution (MKConv), a novel convolution operator that learns to transform the point feature representation from a vector to a multidimensional matrix. Unlike standard point convolution, MKConv proceeds via two steps. (i) It first activates the spatial dimensions of local feature representation by exploiting multi-dimensional kernel weights. These spatially expanded features can represent their embedded information through spatial correlation as well as channel correlation in feature space, carrying more detailed local structure information. (ii) Then, discrete convolutions are applied to the multidimensional features which can be regarded as a grid-structured matrix. In this way, we can utilize the discrete convolutions for point cloud data without voxelization that suffers from information loss. Furthermore, we propose a spatial at-tention module, Multidimensional Local Attention (MLA), to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set by reweighting the spatial feature dimensions. We demonstrate that MKConv has excellent applicability to point cloud processing tasks including object classification, object part seg-mentation, and scene semantic segmentation with superior results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB During the last years, a number of studies have experimented with applying process discovery techniques with the goal of automatically modelling human routines as if they were business processes. However, while promising results have already been achieved, applying process-oriented techniques to smart spaces data comes with its own set of challenges, due to the nature of smart spaces data and characteristics of human behaviour. This paper surveys existing approaches that apply process discovery to smart spaces data and analyses how they deal with the following challenges identified in the literature: choosing a suitable modelling formalism for human behaviour; bridging the abstraction gap between sensor and event logs; segmenting logs in traces; handling multi-user environments; and addressing human behaviour evolution. The main contribution of this article is two-fold: (i) providing the research community with an analysis of the existing applications of process discovery to smart spaces and how they address the above challenges, and (ii) assisting further research efforts by outlining opportunities for future work.

SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DE Image dehazing; Image prior; CNN; Atmospheric scattering model; FA block
AB Dehazing based on deep learning neural networks (CNNs) has achieved remarkable results. However, the most existing dehazing CNNs perform well only on synthetic images and struggle with realistic hazy images. Moreover, training complex dehazing models is challenging due to the limited availability of realistic image datasets, leading to suboptimal performance. For this purpose, we develop a novel Image Prior Dehazing Network called IPDNet to tackle the challenge of dehazing realistic images with limited training data. The IPDNet comprises two sub-networks and a learnable fusion block. The global and local features are obtained by atmospheric scattering and direct mapping via two sub-networks with a sparse mechanism. And the learnable fusion block is settled to acquire the optimal fusion solution to improve the dehazing quality. The IPDNet offers several benefits: (1) a dual network with a learnable fusion block can effectively generate high-quality dehazed images at low computational cost; (2) an image preprocessing block based on dehazing prior can acquires the salient features of realistic hazy image, enhancing the dehazing performance on realistic hazy images; (3) the sub-network is designed by incorporating a feature attention (FA) block into the U-net structure, allowing flexible feature extraction on limited datasets. Extensive experiments on SOTS, NH-HAZE, and DENSE-HAZE datasets show that IPDNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and realistic datasets. Specifically, our model achieved an improvement of approximately 0.84 dB in PSNR and 11.6% in SSIM, demonstrating its effectiveness in realistic scenarios, which contributes to improving traffic safety in adverse weather conditions.

AB The chemical information acquisition capabilities of near infrared (NIR) have attracted great interests of investigators on exploring its potential as process analytical technologies (PAT) on the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, due to the operation environment of TCM is complex and noisy, the accurate online composition detection and analysis is challenging and remains unsolved. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new online TCM composition analysis platform for high quality online spectral data acquisition. We design, VasLine, a generative framework based on deep learning to estimate the multiple critical quality attributes (CQAs). To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, the platform was applied to the extraction process of Xiao'er Xiaoji Zhike Oral Liquid (XXZOL) and the framework was trained to estimate the content of the 7 CQAs. In the evaluation, we carried out 16 batches extraction experiments and collected extensive online NIR data, offline NIR data and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data for TCM composition analysis. The results show that the estimation accuracy of VasLine outperforms the state-of-the-art regression approaches significantly for all the 7 different CQAs, e.g., the R2 metrics of VasLine for the CQAs are all higher than 0.95. This study aims to propose a novel generative framework based on a deep learning model, and the framework is applied in the self-developed platform to estimate CQAs with high-quality generative data from noisy online NIR accurately. The experiments for online TCM composition analysis show that VasLine is a new solution for the quality improvement of the actual pharmaceutical industry.

AB Interior construction makes up a large portion of project budget and time and is more prone to schedule delays. Most research efforts on progress management focus on exterior environment, while few on interior construction. Although progress monitoring methods based on laser point clouds and computer vision are investigated before, the problems of costly acquisition and creation of point clouds and images are still open, which impede the study of progress evaluation, particularly in interior construction environments where clutters and occlusions are universal. This paper introduces a method based on 360 degrees panoramic images and deep learning for fast end-to-end interior progress evaluation in room units. The method takes only one or two 360 degrees panoramic images as input, estimates key corners, generates and registers room layouts, and semantically segments sparse point cloud. With the extracted corners and segmentation results, the progress states of interior trades can be evaluated. The experimental results show that the proposed method based on deep learning techniques achieves comparable performance against those on public data sets with 3D Intersection over Union (3D IoU) of 83.69% vs 84.23%, Corner Error (CE) of 0.4% vs 0.69%, and mean class Interaction over Union (mIoU) of 70.28% vs 53.5%. A case study of an interior decoration project of a hotel is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility and practical capabilities of the proposed method.

AB Short-term electric load forecasting is essential for the operation of power systems and the power market, including economic dispatch, unit commitment, peak load shaving, load management and bidding strategy development. This paper presents a novel method that uses a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) that is cascaded with a fully-connected network, to conduct 24h-ahead electric load forecasting in power systems. Spearman's rank-order correlation, which serves as input size information for the CNN, was used to measure the cross-correlation between two sets of observations (chronological loads) of time shifts or lags. Both max and average pooling operations were utilized to extract data features in concatenation while spatial and conventional dropouts were employed to avoid overfitting in the hybrid CNN. The proposed method used two loops to yield the optimal CNN. The outer loop optimizes the structure and hyperparameters (such as kernel size) of the hybrid CNN by a proposed method of enhanced elite-based particle swarm optimization (EEPSO) while the inner loop optimizes the parameters (such as values of a kernel) and weights in neural networks using the Adam optimizer. The EEPSO is based on the mean search and chaotic descending inertia weight. The proposed method was used to study the 2018 and 2019 hourly load data in Taiwan Power Company. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the well-known ARIMA, Radial Basis Function Network, Support Vector Regression, Long Short-term Memory and their hybrid variants.

AB This study presents a novel approach called Multi-slice Nested Recurrence Plot (MsNRP) for person iden-tification using noisy bio-signals. Prior studies in biometrics have predominantly relied on ideal datasets of 5-10 min, which introduces uncertainty in accuracy when dealing with noisy bio-signals. The proposed MsNRP method captures features from one and multiple cycles without the need for preprocessing, making it well-suited for photoplethysmograms(PPG) and electrocardiograms(ECG). By overcoming the limitations of traditional recurrence plots(RP), MsNRP demonstrates robustness to noisy bio-signal datasets, thus offering a reliable solution for identification in practical scenarios. We demonstrate the experiments of MsNRP on both 5-10 min datasets, similar to previous related work and day-long datasets, measured in daily life emphasizing its robustness in handling noisy data.

AB Organizations increasingly rely on teamwork to achieve their goals. Therefore they continuously strive to improve their teams as their performance is interwoven with that of the organization. To implement beneficial changes, accurate insights into the working of the team are necessary. However, team leaders tend to have an understanding of the team's collaboration that is subjective and seldom completely accurate. Recently there has been an increase in the adoption of digital support systems for collaborative work that capture objective data on how the work took place in reality. This creates the opportunity for data-driven extraction of insights into the collaboration behavior of a team. This data however, does not explicitly record the collaboration relationships, which many existing techniques expect as input. Therefore, these relationships first have to be discovered. Existing techniques that apply discovery are not generally applicable because their notion of collaboration is tailored to the application domain. Moreover, the information that these techniques extract from the data about the nature of the relationships is often limited to the network level. Therefore, this research proposes a generic algorithm that can discover collaboration relationships between resources from event data on any collaborative project. The algorithm adopts an established framework to provide insights into collaboration on a fine-grained level. To this end, three properties are calculated for both the resources and their collaboration relationships: a recency, frequency, and monetary value. The technique's ability to provide valuable insights into the team structure and characteristics is empirically validated on two use cases.

AB Attribute control charts (ACCs) effectively evaluate process' situation based on nonconforming items (NCIs) and defects of items in a process. The traditional control charts (CCs) that analyze process control situations need a major adjustment to take into account uncertainties into eal case problems that can occur due to human evaluations and hesitancies, measurement systems errors, and process situations. The fuzzy set theory (FST) has been used successfully to reach this aim. Recently, some fuzzy set extensions have been integrated into traditional CCs to more extensively and sensitively model the uncertainty by involving other uncertainty parameters, such as non-membership value and hesitancy function. In this paper, one of these extensions, Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), has been adjusted with CCs to model the vagueness of human evaluations, their hesitancies, and uncertainties regarding the process. For this aim, the well-known ACCs based on the total count of defects and NCIs and called c, u, p, and np CCs, respectively, have been re-designed by using PFSs. Additionally, the control procedure of these CCs has been deeply analyzed with respect to fuzzy limit values and fuzzy measurements. Also, a rule-based approach that checks in-control and out-of-control situations regarding distance measurements is suggested to check the sample's status more accurately. The proposed CCs based on PFSs have also been applied on a real case study from a manufacturing factory. The obtained results confirm that the CCs based on PFSs have an ability to create accurate, sensitive, and flexible results by using the input data while analyzing the process' stability.

TI SReResNet: A stage recursive residual network for suppressing semantic

AB Feature extraction neural networks are essential components of computer vision systems. As the most famous one, ResNet has been widely used in engineering. Although many modern networks have outperformed ResNet, the costly pretraining and hyper-parameter optimization processes prevent their application of them in industrial computer vision systems. To avoid these costly processes, a Stage Recursive Residual Network (SReResNet) is proposed, which merely adjusts the forward propagation pipeline without changing the parameter architecture of ResNet. Thus, it can inherit existing model parameters of ResNet and replace ResNet through simple fine-tuning. Moreover, SReResNet is the first network to improve accuracy by utilizing the semantic trend during feature extraction instead of well-designed modules. It models a series of cascaded modules as a semantic unit and feeds the high-level feature maps back to the low-level modules for further semantic redundancy suppression through one feedback connection within the unit based on the semantic trend and the mechanism of looking and thinking twice. For object detection tasks, a Stage Recursive Feature Pyramid Network (SReFPN) is also proposed to rethink and suppress semantic redundancy further. Experiments demonstrate that SReResNet outperforms its counterparts in object detection and image classification tasks. On the MS COCO 2017 dataset, SReResNet outperforms ResNet with 1.2 Box AP improvement, and SReResNet with SReFPN further achieves 2.5 Box AP improvement without bells and whistles. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, SReResNet outperforms its counterparts, such as ResNet, DenseNet, and ConvNeXt, with at least 2.33% top-1 acc improvement. The code is available at https://github.com/unbelieboomboom/SReResNet.

AB A multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) with multiple skills is investigated in this paper. Unlike the traditional form of this problem, and considering the real-world project circumstances, project activities can be preempted. In this paper, a new multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with three objective functions is extended. These objectives are: (1) minimizing the project makespan, (2) minimizing the total resource costs, and (3) minimizing the total project risk. Based on real-life projects, non-renewable resources are represented as an uncertain stochastic parameter. To cope with the uncertain environment, chance-constrained programming with a confidence level is considered. A real-world construction project of a sports center in Tehran is utilized to demonstrate the applicability of the presented formulation. A well-known lexicographic optimization method, namely AUGMECON2, is applied to solve the proposed formulation with three objectives. Ultimately, for the case study and two datasets J30 and MM50, the proposed lexicographic optimization algorithm is compared with an efficient multi-objective mathematical programming technique known as the AUGMECON method. The comparison is based on performance metrics (i.e., IGD and HV) commonly used in multi-objective optimization. The results show the relative dominance of the proposed lexicographic optimization algorithm over the AUGMECON method in all sizes of the problem instances.

AB Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the successful methods of machine learning. SVM uses kernel tricks to efficiently learn non-linear classification tasks. The kernel function is applied to each data instance to map the original non-linear observations into a higher-dimensional space in which they become separable. The Gaussian kernel in Radial-Basis Function (RBF) is a popular kernel function used in various kernelized learning methods. In the RBF kernel, the sigma parameter (bandwidth of kernel function) should be fine-tuned, which is a challenging job. If the sigma value is very small, the decision boundary is highly non-linear. On the other hand, if the sigma value is large, the decision boundary tends to be linear. In this paper, an efficient kernel method called the Apollonius SVM Kernel (ASVMK) is introduced. Our algorithm adjusts the width of the kernel based on the data density and the representativeness of each class. The main idea is to introduce a kernel without adjusting the bandwidth of the kernel based on landmark points and the Apollonius similarity function. ASVMK finds the correlation of dense points and their neighbors in the data and tries to map the original non -linear observations in the highest dimensional space from these features. Reducing memory problems and low computations due to the shrinkage of the gram matrix are some of the benefits of the proposed kernel. The proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods by up to 11%.

AB CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is one of the industry's most widely applied techniques for CO2 utilization. People use the compositional simulation technique to clearly describe CO2 injection processes for EOR, which is always computational-expensive. The main objective of this study is to utilize deep learning (DL) techniques to describe phase behaviors and accelerate compositional simulations. First, we constructed a new DL-based compositional simulation framework. Instead of solving equations of state for every grid cell, this framework can aggregate millions of phase behavior solvers and determine all mixtures' phase status in one single round of calculation. This trait can significantly improve the efficiency of solving numerical equations. Next, we illustrated how to develop DL-based phase behavior models to determine phase status accurately. Our newly proposed single-phase identification model can resolve the difficulty in inaccurate singlephase labeling within compositional simulations, greatly benefiting the numerical convergence of simulation. Finally, we tested abundant complicated cases covering near-miscible and miscible gas injection processes and demonstrated the new DL-based method's strength in accelerating the compositional simulation. Besides, we also presented the DL-based method's more substantial power in numerical convergences that it could succeed in cases where the standard simulation method fails. This work can contribute to more efficiently and effectively describing complex fluid displacement processes, benefiting CO2 injection EOR and other utilizations like CO2 sequestrations.

AB Distributed anode current (DAC) is a high-dimensional spatial-distributed signal that can be measured online in the industrial aluminum electrolysis process. The difference of physicochemical properties in different spatial regions in an aluminum electrolysis cell can be obtained by spatial clustering analysis of DAC data. In this study, a dynamic spatial distributed information clustering method (DSDIC) for aluminum electrolysis cell is proposed. This method can effectively capture the complex dynamic spatio-temporal correlations in DAC. Firstly, the dynamic graph is identified to capture the complex dynamicity of the DAC. Then, the anode-spatial structure information (ASSI) extends the one-dimensional current signal generated by each carbon anode into a feature matrix to achieve the fusion of data and spatial structure knowledge. Finally, the adjacency matrix of dynamic graph performs low-pass filtering on the feature matrix to obtain low-frequency information that is beneficial to downstream learning tasks. Meanwhile, a fixed graph structure based on process mechanism knowledge is designed to capture the spatial correlation caused by external periodic operations in industrial process. The experimental results on the actual industrial aluminum electrolysis datasets show that our method improves the clustering accuracy by 3.96% compared with existing clustering methods.

AB Within the intensive care unit (ICU), vital signs such as arterial blood pressure (ABP) collected from electronic health records (EHRs) are typically recorded at different and uneven sampling frequencies and are often infrequently measured due to the nature of the medical treatment. Furthermore, from a temporal trajectory perspective, EHR data are likely to be corrupted by outlying patterns that deviate from normal samples in terms of the curves' magnitude and shape. In this work, we propose a two-stage outlier detection approach for sparse and irregularly sampled (SiS) temporal data using functional data analysis (FDA) tools. In the first stage, an outlier identification measure is defined by a max-min statistic and a clean subset that contains nonoutliers. In the second stage, a multiple hypothesis testing problem is formulated based on the asymptotic distribution of the proposed measure. The simulation-based framework shows that the proposed method is robust to different types of shape and magnitude outliers. The detection results are more accurate than the widely used functional depth methods, especially in extremely sparse settings where the proportion of the observed data points over the entire time series is approximately 10%. Extensive experiments are also conducted on the real-world MIMIC-II dataset, which demonstrate that the method effectively detects clinically meaningful outlying patterns.

Spatial correlations among different nodes and temporal features from history operation status in the transmitted data packets are extracted by the convolution neural network. Capsules in the proposed structure have important implications for maintaining the topological consistency contained in the measurement matrix. Furthermore, the proposed method is model-free and avoids the impact of system parameters uncertainties on detection performance. Multiple kinds of typical cyber-attacks, including false data injection attacks, replay attacks, denial of service attacks, time-delay attacks, and deception attacks, are considered and modeled in this paper. Numerical results on the IEEE 39-bus test system show that the proposed method can achieve 99.97% detection accuracy on single cyber-attacks and 96.25% detection accuracy on multiple cyber-attacks. Comparative results illustrate the proposed method outperforms than traditional neural networks. This approach provides a solution for the problem of multiple cyber-attack detection and classification.

TI Learning pixel-adaptive weights for portrait photo retouching *

ID FUSION
AB The lookup table-based methods achieve promising retouching performance by learning image-adaptive weights to combine 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) and conducting pixel-to-pixel color transformation. However, this paradigm ignores the local context cues and applies the same transformation to portrait pixels and background pixels that exhibit the same raw RGB values. In contrast, an expert usually conducts different operations to adjust the color temperatures, tones of portrait regions, and background regions. This inspires us to model local context cues to improve the retouching quality explicitly.Thus, the center pixel of an image patch is first retouched by predicting pixel-adaptive lookup table weights. To modulate the influence of neighboring pixels, as neighboring pixels exhibit different affinities to the center pixel, a local attention mask is estimated. Then, the quality of the local attention mask is further improved by applying supervision, which is based on the affinity map calculated by the ground-truth portrait mask. For group-level consistency, we propose to directly constrain the variance of mean color components in the Lab space. Extensive experiments on the PPR10K dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the retouching performance on high-resolution photos is improved by over 0.5dB in terms of PSNR, and the group-level inconsistency is reduced by 2.1. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID SVDD
AB In comparison with support vector data description (SVDD), deep SVDD (DSVDD) is more suitable for dealing with large-scale data sets. DSVDD uses mapping network to replace the role of kernel mapping in SVDD. Moreover, the objective of DSVDD is to simultaneously learn the optimal connection weights of mapping network and the minimum volume of hypersphere. To further improve the performance of DSVDD for tackling large-scale data sets and obtain the discriminative features of the given samples in a self-supervised learning manner, contrastive DSVDD (CDSVDD) is proposed in this study. In the pre-training phase of CDSVDD, the contrastive loss and the rotation prediction loss are jointly minimized to achieve the optimal feature representations. Further-more, the learned feature representations are utilized to determine the hypersphere center. In the training phase of CDSVDD, the distances between the obtained feature representations and the hypersphere center together with the contrastive loss are simultaneously minimized to derive the optimal network connection weights, the min-imum volume of hypersphere and the optimal feature representations. In addition, CDSVDD can efficiently solve the hypersphere collapse problem of DSVDD. The ablation study on CDSVDD verifies that compared with the case of determining the hypersphere center by the feature representations of the original samples, the hyper -sphere center determined by the feature representations of the augmented samples makes CDSVDD achieve better hypersphere boundary and more compact feature representations. Experimental results on the four benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed CDSVDD acquires better detection performance in com-parison with its six pertinent methods.

AB Distributed generation and diversified loads increase the uncertainty of district power prediction. Useful prediction requires a highly accurate model, and there are several challenges facing the designers of a new power system with intelligent power distribution. To solve them, we improved an XGBoost model from three aspects: model, data, and performance. This paper proposes an XGBoost model with a windowed mechanism and random grid search (WR-XGBoost model) for self-prediction of short-term district power load. Specifically, a causal sliding window with different strides is introduced into the model optimization stage to process the training and test sets separately. In data optimization, the model initially processes the data organized in forms and then uses discrete difference data as input. Finally, in optimizing the performance, a random grid search method reduces the debugging of hyperparameters. The results show that the WR-XGBoost model outperforms five comparison models in terms of predictive power and generalization, using four datasets and seven statistical indicators.

ID DEFECT DETECTION
AB Rail corrugation is a common wear mechanism of high-speed railways and subways, which can cause derailment and running noise. However, rail corrugation only has slight texture change on the rail surface, so it is difficult to detect accurately by traditional detection methods. In this paper, a real-time detection method of rail corrugation based on machine vision and a convolutional neural network is proposed, which effectively improves the accuracy and efficiency of rail corrugation detection. Combined with the gray features of each part of the image, a rail surface segmentation method based on the gray maximum value of the sliding window is also proposed. Moreover, the obtained rail surface image is clearer and the feature information of the rail surface can be completely retained, compared with the adaptive threshold segmentation and edge detection segmentation. ShuffleNet V2, a lightweight convolutional neural network, was selected as the corrugation detection model. The squeeze-and-excitation module was integrated into its basic unit to improve its channel attention, and the activation function was re-selected to make the detection have better real-time performance and accuracy. Through experimental verification, the average detection time of a single image of the improved model is 4.01ms, and the detection accuracy is 2.78% higher than that of the unimproved ShuffleNet V2. The research results will be beneficial to the development of the intelligent real-time detection of rail corrugation.

ID SYSTEM MODEL; OUTPUT
AB To realize accurate predictions for a system with a new disturbance, the concept of a time breakpoint is introduced, and the grey breakpoint prediction model GBPM(1,1,t) and corresponding optimized model OGBPM(1,1,t) are established. A variety of methods are introduced to calculate the model coefficients. The results show that with the establishment of time breakpoints and accurately estimated parameters, the grey breakpoint prediction model can effectively capture the system changes caused by changes in the external environment to achieve accurate system predictions. Additionally, the application of the grey breakpoint prediction model in policy evaluation is discussed. The new model requires only a small amount of data to evaluate policy effectiveness. Compared with traditional policy evaluation methods such as the double difference and breakpoint regression methods, the proposed approach is more convenient. Finally, the validity of the new model for forecasting and policy evaluation is verified using four practical cases. In comparisons with the BP, ARIMA, GM(1,1), and FGM(1,1) models, the grey breakpoint model, especially OGBPM(1,1,t), displays the best modeling performance, the best fitting accuracy and the highest precision. Through four cases, it is found that the grey breakpoint prediction model displays good applicability and superiority in forecasting and policy evaluation tasks.

DE Model compression; Knowledge distillation; Representation learning;
   Contrastive learning; Privacy protection
AB Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model compression and trans-mission restrictions while retaining privacy protection, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distin-guish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category -wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation (CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the mod-ules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo -supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and gen-erator brought by CPSC-DFKD.

AB In this study, a general network model called multi-progressive image deblurring network is proposed to correct blurring artifacts and local imaging details in underwater images. As a solution to nonuniform image distortion, a deformable convolution module was designed to enrich the encoded information of the image representation. Using a stepwise feature refinement module, multi-progressive image deblurring network can reduce the loss of contextual information to produce a more realistic underwater image for subsequent applications. Constructing a loss function based on multi-scale content can help the model improve image perception quality. We conducted experimental evaluations on large-scale image deblurring benchmark datasets, such as GoPro and HIDE, achieving excellent results with 32.84 dB and 31.03 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio, respectively, using the proposed method. Subsequently, a detailed optimization comparison was conducted on the in-house underwater image deblurring dataset. Multi-progressive image deblurring network obtained higher-quality, clearer images. Compared with the current state-of-the-art image deblurring algorithms, the proposed model achieved significant results with a 6.6% increase in deblur performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, we conducted ablation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of all the modules in the proposed framework.

AB The acoustic emission (AE) technique is known for its sensitivity to early damage and is well-suited for online condition monitoring of rolling element bearings (REBs) in various industrial application scenarios. Nonetheless, identifying weak faults under varying speed and strong background noise conditions still remains challenging. In addition, the comprehensive modelling of AE signal from faulty REB in electromechanical systems is still a pending issue. In light of this, a well-considered model is firstly developed for the AE signal of faulty REBs in this work. After that, a novel bearing fault diagnosis framework based on semantic segmentation networks is devised. Precisely, the proposed framework consists of three main components: a preprocessing step depending on the signal segmentation algorithm, a diagnosis step using fault fingerprint mapping, and a postprocessing evaluation step supplemented by a density peak clustering (DPC) approach. We evaluate the presented procedures through simulation analysis and an experimental case under varying speed conditions. Meanwhile, the comparison with the original threshold-based fault fingerprint recognition algorithm is also conducted. The comprehensive results demonstrate the efficacy of identifying fault-associated fingerprint feature (FPF), indicating that the proposed framework holds promise for condition monitoring.

AB The objective of this paper is to introduce several dynamic spherical fuzzy aggregation operators (AOs) for "multi-period decision-making"(MPDM) problems. In these problems, decision-makers (DMs) have access to all information in the form of spherical fuzzy numbers (SpFNs) that cover different time periods. AOs hold a crucial responsibility in the decision-making process, particularly in situations where there are conflicting factors that must be considered. When working with different data sets, the main problem is coming up with appropriate aggregating algorithms. "Spherical fuzzy dynamic Einstein weighted averaging (SpFDEWA) and spherical fuzzy dynamic Einstein weighted geometric (SpFDEWG) operators"are two novel Einstein AOs that we have introduced. These AOs have a number of enticing qualities that are discussed in detail. We also provide a method for dealing with MPDM issues using the best possible solutions. Along with an explanation of how the suggested method might be used, a numerical illustration of municipal supply chain management is given. A comparative analysis is conducted between the proposed and existing research to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed approach. An analysis of authenticity is also included to showcase the efficacy of the proposed strategy. Multi-stage and dynamic decision analysis are often pertinent to suggested pathways of action and decision-making processes in the real world.

AB Picture fuzzy set (PFS) is one the reliable tool to handle the uncertainties in the data as compared to the intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) or fuzzy set. PFS simultaneously handle the four degrees namely, membership, neutrality, non-membership, and refusal, and thus widely applicable to solve the real-life decision-making problems more accurately. Keeping their advantages, in this paper, we present some interactive operational laws for the picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs) to aggregate picture fuzzy information. Also, we state some new information measures namely picture fuzzy similarity measures (PFSimMs) based on fuzzy strict negations, which can overcome the various drawbacks of the existing PFSimMs. The various properties and their features are studied in detail to show their advantages. Finally, we develop a prospect theory-based multi-attributive border approximation area comparison (MABAC) method under picture fuzzy environment by using the proposed operational laws and PFSimMs to solve the decision-making problems. The applicability of the developed algorithm is explained through a numerical example and show its superiorities.

AB The analysis of wake effects within wind farms is paramount to elevating power generation efficiency, especially when considering the losses incurred by wake effects. In the present investigation, we introduce an innovative neural network-based model - adaptive reduction three-way long short term attention network (ART-LSTANet) - designed to augment the precision of wind turbine wake flow field predictions. Unlike conventional methodologies that often segregate the reduced-order model from the prediction procedure, our proposed model exploits adaptive order reduction to swiftly procure the necessary input for the predictive model, thus curtailing the time expenditure throughout the entire process. The predictive model subsequently incorporates carefully designed feature extraction components tailored to multiple temporal scales, with parameters being updated via a data-driven approach. A comparative analysis with six established intelligent algorithms underscores the superiority of the ART-LSTANet. Comprehensive results indicate that ART-LSTANet delivers superior performance in the reconstruction of the wake flow field, demonstrating a reduction in the mean squared error by up to 9.0% and in the root mean squared error by up to 3.3% compared to traditional methodologies. Numerical errors calculated under a spectrum of additional evaluation metrics consistently yield the lowest values.

AB One Shot Learning includes all those techniques that make it possible to classify images using a single image per category. One of its possible applications is the identification of food products. For a grocery store, it is interesting to record a single image of each product and be able to recognise it again from other images, such as photos taken by customers. Within deep learning, Siamese neural networks are able to verify whether two images belong to the same category or not. In this paper, a new Siamese net-work training technique, called CP-CVV, is presented. It uses the combination of different models trained with different classes. The separation of validation classes has been done in such a way that each of the combined models is different in order to avoid overfitting with respect to the validation. Unlike normal training, the test images belong to classes that have not previously been used in training, allowing the model to work on new categories, of which only one image exists. Different backbones have been eval-uated in the Siamese composition, but also the integration of multiple models with different backbones. The results show that the model improves on previous works and allows the classification problem to be solved, an additional step towards the use of Siamese networks. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that has proposed integrating Siamese neural networks using a class-based validation set separation technique so as to be better at generalising for unknown classes. Additionally, we have applied Cross-Validation-Voting with ConvNeXt to improve the existing classification results of a well-known Grocery Store Dataset.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Image description via robust local descriptors plays a vital role in a large number of image representation and matching applications. In this paper, we propose a novel distinctive local image descriptor that is based on the phase and amplitude information of Polar Complex Exponential Transform (PCET). The proposed descriptor, called IPCET (Improved PCET), is robust to the common photometric transformations (e.g., illumination, noise, JPEG compression, and blur) and geometric transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation, translation, and significant affine distortion). We perform extensive experiments to compare our IPCET descriptor with six most cutting-edge region descriptors (i.e., SIFT, Zernike Moment, GLOH, PCA-SIFT, SURF, and ORB). Experimental results demonstrate that our IPCET descriptor outperforms cutting-edge moment-based descriptors.

AB The efficient and accurate model construction of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system is the key to its analysis, prediction, and optimization. As a typical multidisturbance nonlinear dynamic system, the ORC system always operates in a nonstationary state. Under uncertain disturbance, accurately identifying the thermal power conversion process state and quickly realizing the accurate association of various mappings are the key considerations of constructing the data-driven model of the ORC system. From the perspective of data selection, parameter association, and structural design, this study proposes a methodology for the efficient multilayer adaptive self-organizing modeling of ORC systems. This methodology can realize efficient autonomous modeling in the whole design process of the data-driven model of the ORC system. Moreover, the proposed methodology can minimize the structural risk of the model by balancing the empirical risk and structural complexity. By taking real data as the test base, the generalization ability and time cost of the data self-selection layer, information self-correlation layer and adaptive self-organizing part of the structure layer are evaluated. Compared with the direct construction of the ORC system data model, the proposed methodology can reduce the model construction time cost by 75.54% and improve the generalization ability by 61.88%. In addition, maximizing the generalization capability with minimum structural risk is an important part of data-driven model construction of ORC systems. In this study, a data-driven model structural reliability assessment approach for ORC systems is proposed. Then, the proposed adaptive self-organizing optimization methodology is verified on the basis of the structural reliability assessment model. The multilayer adaptive self-organizing modeling methodology proposed in this study can provide new ideas and necessary theoretical guidance.

However, the deployment process of these smart wireless devices when delivered to customer premises is slow and error prone as each of them needs to be provisioned with authentication credentials to access the corporate network. In this paper, we propose HANNA, a humanfriendly provisioning and configuration framework for smart devices, that extends the zero-touch paradigm to large IoT deployments by introducing voice assisted configuration in combination with large scale ad-hoc communications to overcome the initial installation effort of IoT deployments. The most prominent role in HANNA is played by the assisting device, which includes a voice assistant capable of correctly understanding a minimum number of keywords required for initial provisioning and configuration of the devices. The device's role is to interact with the user and ensure that all provisioning details are received. These are then converted into appropriate machine instructions for further use by the mass provisioning mechanism. We provide an example prototype implementation of HANNA and evaluate the performance of the assisting device in the human-to-machine communication phase and the performance of the selected communication technique in the machine-to-machine communication phase. Our results show the potential of existing speech-to-text engines for this application area and also reveal shortcomings with respect to the robustness of the engines in office-like working environments as well as with respect to user's gender and language proficiency level. Additionally we show that the proposed machine-to-machine provisioning approach is always faster compared to manual provisioning for cases with more than ten devices.

AB The accuracy of graph representation learning is highly dependent on the precise characterization of node relationships. However, representing the complex and diverse networks in the real world using a single type of node or link is challenging, often resulting in incomplete information. Moreover, different types of nodes and links convey rich information, which makes it difficult to design a graph network that can integrate diverse links. This paper introduces a novel multi-view and multi-layer attention model designed to optimize node embeddings for semi-supervised node classification. The proposed model exploits various types of inter -node links and employs the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion to maximize the dissimilarity between distinct node relationships. Furthermore, the multi-layer attention mechanism is used to discern the impact of different neighboring nodes and relationships between various node relationships. The performance of the proposed model, MVMA-GCN, was assessed on numerous real-world multi-view datasets. It was observed that MVMA-GCN consistently outperformed existing models, demonstrating superior accuracy in semi-supervised classification tasks. We have made our code publicly available at here to ensure the reproducibility of our results.

AB Mainstream tracking approaches have achieved remarkable performance by adopting transformer structures. However, transformer structures' inherent design of dot-product with softmax normalization incurs quadratic computation complexity regarding sequence length. This issue is further complicated when vision tasks employ softmax attention, as sequence length scales with the square of images' sizes. Even though sparse attention and low-rank decomposition can alleviate over-inflated computation, it is still laborious to balance trackers' accu-racy, computation cost, and inference speed. To tackle the above problems, we propose an Information-Diffused Graph tracking pipeline with linear complexity (IDGtrack). As the feature constraint relationship in the physical world is an important cue for vision tasks, graph modules are constructed with information-diffused adjacency matrices to substitute softmax attention, which is not only efficient for linear computations but also maintains the non-negativity and global distribution of the attention matrix. Distinct from traditional linear attention methods exclusive to self-attention, a self-integrated and cross-context graph module with linear complexity is explored where a complete bipartite graph is established between the target and search region, facilitating a comprehensive perception of local and background information. Extensive experiments are conducted on public tracking benchmarks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 111 FPS on GPU RTX3090.

AB Predicting taxi demands in large cities can help in better traffic management as well as ensure better commuter satisfaction for an intelligent transportation system. However, the traffic demands across different locations have varying spatio-temporal correlations that are difficult to model. Despite the ability of the existing Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to capture the non-linearity in spatial and temporal characteristics of the demand time-series, capturing spatio-temporal characteristics in different real-world scenarios like varying historic and prediction time frame, spatio-temporal variations due to noise or missing data, etc. still remain a big challenge for the state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce Encoder-ApproXimator (EnAppX), an encoder-decoder DNN-based model that uses Chebyshev function approximation in the decoding stage for taxi demand times-series prediction and can better estimate the time-series in the presence of large spatio-temporal variations. Opposed to any existing state-of-the-art model, the proposed model approximates complete spatiotemporal characteristics in the frequency domain which in turn enables the model to make a robust and improved prediction in different scenarios. Validation over two real-world taxi datasets from different cities shows a considerable improvement of around 23% in RMSE scores compared to the state-of-the-art baseline model. Unlike several existing state-of-the-art models, EnAppX also produces improved prediction accuracy across two regions for both to and fro demands.

AB Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to fuse the information among multiple views to achieve effective clustering. Many MVC algorithms based on semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) typically have two issues: (1) their optimization schemes are not flexible enough; and (2) the variables are updated only rely on the data but not guided by learning rate. These problems can result in very poor clusters generated. In this paper, we present a multi-view clustering algorithm based on deep SNMF (MCDS) to resolve these issues. Specifically, we first design two types of activation functions to restrict the value domain of the element in the low-dimensional matrix to eliminate the constraint. Then, the SGD algorithm is used to implement element update guided by the learning rate. After obtaining the corresponding weight matrix and bias matrix, we combine them with the activation functions to construct a deep SNMF (DSNMF) network. This network is to update the element in the corresponding low-dimensional matrix for each view and obtain the consensus matrix. To validate the proposed algorithm, numerous experiments are performed on six multi-view datasets including both normal and large-scale datasets. The results demonstrate that MCDS can achieve excellent clustering results and outperform other competitive methods.

   estimation; Dynamic model
AB For visual estimation of optical flow, which is crucial for various vision analyses, unsupervised learning by view synthesis has emerged as a promising alternative to supervised methods because the ground-truth flow is not readily available in many cases. However, unsupervised learning is likely to be unstable when pixel tracking is lost via occlusion and motion blur, or pixel correspondence is impaired by variations in image content and spatial structure over time. Recognizing that dynamic occlusions and object variations usually exhibit a smooth temporal transition in natural settings, we shifted our focus to model unsupervised learning optical flow from multi-frame sequences of such dynamic scenes. Specifically, we simulated various dynamic scenarios and occlusion phenomena based on Markov property, allowing the model to extract motion laws and thus gain performance in dynamic and occluded areas, which diverges from existing methods without considering temporal dynamics. In addition, we introduced a temporal dynamic model based on a well-designed spatial-temporal dual recurrent block, resulting in a lightweight model structure with fast inference speed. Assuming the temporal smoothness of optical flow, we used the prior motions of adjacent frames to supervise the occluded regions more reliably. Experiments on several optical flow benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method, as the performance is comparable to several state-of-the-art methods with advantages in memory and computational overhead.

AB The security and confidentiality of medical images are of utmost importance due to frequent issues such as leakage, theft, and tampering during transmission and storage, which seriously impact patient privacy. Traditional encryption techniques applied to entire images have proven to be ineffective in guaranteeing timely encryption and preserving the privacy of organ regions separated from the background. In response, this study proposes a specialized and efficient local image encryption algorithm for the medical field. The proposed encryption algorithm focuses on the regions of interest (ROI) within massive medical images. Initially, the Laplacian of Gaussian operator and the outer boundary tracking algorithm are employed to extract the binary image and achieve ROI edge extraction. Subsequently, the image is divided into ROI and ROB (regions outside ROI). The ROI is transformed into a row vector and rearranged using the Lorenz hyperchaotic system. The rearranged sequence is XOR with the random sequence generated by the Henon chaotic map. Next, the encrypted sequence is arranged according to the location of the ROI region and recombined with the unencrypted ROB to obtain the complete encrypted image. Finally, the least significant bit algorithm controlled by the key is used to embed binary image into the encrypted image to ensure lossless decryption of the medical images. Experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed selective encryption algorithm for massive medical images offers relatively ideal security and higher encryption efficiency. This algorithm addresses the privacy concerns and challenges faced in the medical field and contributes to the secure transmission and storage of massive medical images.

AB In recent years, single-image super-resolution (SISR) has made significant progress using convolutional neural networks. However, to achieve better performance, many methods deepen the network depth and stack a large number of parameters. Unfortunately, this leads to high computational complexity and is difficult to apply on ordinary intelligent devices used by the public. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight SISR network that uses thin convolutional groups to significantly reduce network size. We also optimize the network structure to compensate for the loss in performance caused by the reduction in the number of parameters. Our proposed CRUN(Cascade Compound Residual UNet Network) model utilizes cascade residuals structure as the backbone to deepen the network and increase its receptive field. We then use skip connections and dense connection structures to design deep feature extraction blocks that reduce the network's dependence on feature dimensions. Moreover, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement Block (MFEB) to fuse features at different levels, compensating for the weakness of thin convolutional groups in obtaining features. Our experimental results show that the CRUN model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models while requiring relatively fewer resources. This improvement makes our proposed model more practical and suitable for usage on everyday devices.

AB The Abstractive summarization is an approach to document summarization that is not limited to selecting sentences from the document but can generate new sentences as well. We address the two main challenges in abstractive summarization: how to evaluate the performance of a summarization model and what is a good training objective. We first introduce new evaluation measures based on the semantic similarity of the input and corresponding summary. The similarity scores are obtained by the fine-tuned BERTurk model using either the cross-encoder or a bi-encoder architecture. The fine-tuning is done on the Turkish Natural Language Inference and Semantic Textual Similarity benchmark datasets. We show that these measures have better correlations with human evaluations compared to Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) scores and BERTScore. We then introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that uses the proposed semantic similarity measures as rewards, together with a mixed training objective, in order to generate more natural summaries in terms of human readability. We show that training with a mixed training objective function compared to only the maximum-likelihood objective improves similarity scores.

AB We present a novel Transformer-based network architecture for instance-aware image-to-image translation, dubbed InstaFormer, to effectively integrate global- and instance-level information. By considering extracted content features from an image as visual tokens, our model discovers global consensus of content features by considering context information through self-attention module of Transformers. By augmenting such tokens with an instance-level feature extracted from the content feature with respect to bounding box information, our framework is capable of learning an interaction between object instances and the global image, thus boosting the instance-awareness. We replace layer normalization (LayerNorm) in standard Transformers with adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) to enable a multi-modal translation with style codes. In addition, to improve the instance-awareness and translation quality at object regions, we present an instance-level content contrastive loss defined between input and translated image. Although competitive performance can be attained by InstaFormer, it may face some limitations, i.e., limited scalability in handling multiple domains, and reliance on domain annotations. To overcome this, we propose InstaFormer++ as an extension of Instaformer, which enables multi-domain translation in instance-aware image translation for the first time. We propose to obtain pseudo domain label by leveraging a list of candidate domain labels in a text format and pretrained vision-language model. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DE Faces; Relighting; Neural radiance fields; Virtual reality
AB Portrait viewpoint and illumination editing is an important problem with several applications in VR/AR, movies, and photography. Comprehensive knowledge of geometry and illumination is critical for obtaining photorealistic results. Current methods are unable to explicitly model in 3D while handling both viewpoint and illumination editing from a single image. In this paper, we propose VoRF, a novel approach that can take even a single portrait image as input and relight human heads under novel illuminations that can be viewed from arbitrary viewpoints. VoRF represents a human head as a continuous volumetric field and learns a prior model of human heads using a coordinate-based MLP with individual latent spaces for identity and illumination. The prior model is learned in an auto-decoder manner over a diverse class of head shapes and appearances, allowing VoRF to generalize to novel test identities from a single input image. Additionally, VoRF has a reflectance MLP that uses the intermediate features of the prior model for rendering One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images under novel views. We synthesize novel illuminations by combining these OLAT images with target environment maps. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of VoRF for relighting and novel view synthesis, even when applied to unseen subjects under uncontrolled illumination. This work is an extension of Rao et al. (VoRF: Volumetric Relightable Faces 2022). We provide extensive evaluation and ablative studies of our model and also provide an application, where any face can be relighted using textual input.

AB Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in the field of drug discovery. Several works use graph neural networks to leverage molecular graph representations. Although they have been successfully applied in a variety of applications, their decision process is not transparent. In this work, we adapt concept whitening to graph neural networks. This approach is an explainability method used to build an inherently interpretable model, which allows identifying the concepts and consequently the structural parts of the molecules that are relevant for the output predictions. We test popular models on several benchmark datasets from MoleculeNet. Starting from previous work, we identify the most significant molecular properties to be used as concepts to perform classification. We show that the addition of concept whitening layers brings an improvement in both classification performance and interpretability. Finally, we provide several structural and conceptual explanations for the predictions.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION
AB Dynamic networks are ubiquitous for modelling sequential graph-structured data, e.g., brain connectivity, population migrations, and social networks. In this work, we consider the discrete-time framework of dynamic networks and aim at detecting change-points, i.e., abrupt changes in the structure or attributes of the graph snapshots. This task is often termed network change-point detection and has numerous applications, such as market phase discovery, fraud detection, and activity monitoring. In this work, we propose a data-driven method that can adapt to the specific network domain, and be used to detect distribution changes with no delay and in an online setting. Our algorithm is based on a siamese graph neural network, designed to learn a graph similarity function on the graph snapshots from the temporal network sequence. Without any prior knowledge on the network generative distribution and the type of change-points, our learnt similarity function allows to more effectively compare the current graph and its recent history, compared to standard graph distances or kernels. Moreover, our method can be applied to a large variety of network data, e.g., networks with edge weights or node attributes. We test our method on synthetic and real-world dynamic network data, and demonstrate that it is able to perform online network change-point detection in diverse settings. Besides, we show that it requires a shorter data history to detect changes than most existing state-of-the-art baselines.

AB This paper aims to show that dominant conceptions of intelligence used in artificial intelligence (AI) are biased by normative assumptions that originate from the Global North, making it questionable if AI can be uncritically applied elsewhere without risking serious harm to vulnerable people. After the introduction in Sect. 1 we shortly present the history of IQ testing in Sect. 2, focusing on its multiple discriminatory biases. To determine how these biases came into existence, we define intelligence ontologically and underline its constructed and culturally variable character. Turning to AI, specifically the Turing Test (TT), in Sect. 3, we critically examine its underlying intelligence conceptions. The test has been of central influence in AI research and remains an important point of orientation. We argue that both the test itself and how it is used in practice risk promoting a limited conception of intelligence which solely originated in the Global North. Hence, this conception should be critically assessed in relation to the different global contexts in which AI technologies are and will be used. In Sect. 4, we highlight how unequal power relations in AI research are a real threat, rather than just philosophical sophistry while considering the history of IQ testing and the TT's practical biases. In the last section, we examine the limits of our account and identify fields for further investigation. Tracing colonial continuities in AI intelligence research, this paper points to a more diverse and historically aware approach to the design, development, and use of AI.

AB Social and moral norms are a fabric for holding human societies together and helping them to function. As such they will also become a means of evaluating the performance of future human-machine systems. While machine ethics has offered various approaches to endowing machines with normative competence, from the more logic-based to the more data-based, none of the proposals so far have considered the challenge of capturing the "spirit of a norm," which often eludes rigid interpretation and complicates doing the right thing. We present some paradigmatic scenarios across contexts to illustrate why the spirit of a norm can be critical to make explicit and why it exposes the inadequacies of mere data-driven "value alignment" techniques such as reinforcement learning RL for interactive, real-time human-robot interaction. Instead, we argue that norm learning, in particular, learning to capture the spirit of a norm, requires combining common-sense inference-based and data-driving approaches.

ID VANISHING POINT DETECTION; VISION
AB Road drivable area detection is an important task in computer vision with applications in self-driving cars. Accurately detecting and mapping drivable areas in a scene allow vehicles and robots to plan safe trajectories. In this paper, a novel cognitively inspired approach is proposed that considers both the salient areas in a driving scene and the driver's attention mechanism. Specifically, the attention point is computed by combining salient areas and attention regions. Furthermore, we use the attention point and two boundary nodes on the road edge to form a triangular road surface area. Finally, we segment this area and remove the salient region within this area to obtain the drivable road area. Experimental results show that our proposed method can address the shortcomings of traditional vanishing point detection algorithms and enhance drivable area perception when combined with 4 different backbones on the DeepLabV3+ model. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of merging salient area and attention area algorithms and explore the joint understanding of these complementary visual cues.

AB Explicable recommendation system is proved to be conducive to improving the persuasiveness of the recommendation system, enabling users to trust the system more and make more intelligent decisions. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) produces interpretable solutions for many applications including collaborative filtering as it's nonnegativity. However, the latent features make it difficult to interpret recommendation results to users because we don't know the specific meaning of features that users are interested in and the extent to which the items or users belong to these features. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a novel method called Partially Explainable Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (PE-NMF) by employing explicit data to replace part latent variables of item-feature matrix, by which users can learn more about the features of the items and then to make ideal decisions and recommendations. The objective function of PE-NMF is composed of two parts: one part corresponding to explicit features and the other part is about implicit features. We develop an iterative method to minimize the objective function and derive the iterative update rules, with which the objective function can be proved to be decreasing. Finally, the experiments are executed on Yelp, Amazon and Dianping datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate PE-NMF keeps a high prediction performance on both rating prediction and top-N recommendation that compare to fully explainable nonnegative matrix factorization (FE-NMF), which is obtained by using explicit opinions instead of item-feature matrix. Also PE-NMF holds almost the same recommendation ability as NMF.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) human pose recognition techniques based on spatial data have gained attention. However, existing models and algorithms fail to achieve desired precision. We propose a 3D human motion pose recognition method using deep contrastive learning and an improved Transformer. The improved Transformer removes noise between human motion RGB and depth images, addressing orientation correlation in 3D models. Two-dimensional (2D) pose features are extracted from de-noised RGB images using a kernel generation module in a graph convolutional network (GCN). Depth features are extracted from de-noised depth images. The 2D pose features and depth features are fused using a regression module in the GCN to obtain 3D pose recognition results. The results demonstrate that the proposed method captures RGB and depth images, achieving high recognition accuracy and fast speed. The proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in 3D human motion pose recognition.

AB Predictive models such as decision trees and neural networks may produce predictions with unfairness. Some algorithms have been proposed to mitigate unfair predictions when protected attributes are considered individually. However, mitigating unfair predictions becomes more difficult when the application involves multiple protected attributes that are expected to be enforced simultaneously. This issue has not been solved, and existing methods are not able to solve it. The paper aims to be the first to solve this problem and proposes a method for post-processing unfair predictions to achieve fair ones. The method considers multiple simultaneous protected attributes together with context attributes, such as position, profession and education, that describe contextual details of the application. Our method consists of two steps. The first step uses a nonlinear optimization problem to determine the best adjustment plan for meeting the requirements of multiple simultaneous protected attributes while better preserving the original predictions. This optimization guarantees the solution to handle the interaction among multiple protected attributes regarding fairness in the best manner. The second steps learns adjustment thresholds using the results of optimization. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world datasets, and the evaluation shows that the proposed method makes effective adjustments to meet fairness requirements.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Task-and-motion planning; Multi-robot collaboration; Collaborative

AB We address multi-robot geometric task-and-motion planning (MR-GTAMP) problems in synchronous, monotone setups. The goal of the MR-GTAMP problem is to move objects with multiple robots to goal regions in the presence of other movable objects. We focus on collaborative manipulation tasks where the robots have to adopt intelligent collaboration strategies to be successful and effective, i.e., decide which robot should move which objects to which positions, and perform collaborative actions, such as handovers. To endow robots with these collaboration capabilities, we propose to first collect occlusion and reachability information for each robot by calling motion-planning algorithms. We then propose a method that uses the collected information to build a graph structure which captures the precedence of the manipulations of different objects and supports the implementation of a mixed-integer program to guide the search for highly effective collaborative task-and-motion plans. The search process for collaborative task-and-motion plans is based on a Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration strategy to achieve exploration-exploitation balance. We evaluate our framework in two challenging MR-GTAMP domains and show that it outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines with respect to the planning time, the resulting plan length and the number of objects moved. We also show that our framework can be applied to underground mining operations where a robotic arm needs to coordinate with an autonomous roof bolter. We demonstrate plan execution in two roof-bolting scenarios both in simulation and on robots.

ID LINEAR LOGIC
AB Lambek categorial grammars is a class of formal grammars based on the Lambek calculus. Pentus proved in 1993 that they generate exactly the class of context-free languages without the empty word. In this paper, we study categorial grammars based on the Lambek calculus with the permutation rule LP. Of particular interest is the product-free fragment of LP called the Lambek-van Benthem calculus LBC. Buszkowski in his 1984 paper conjectured that grammars based on the Lambek-van Benthem calculus (LBC-grammars for short) generate exactly permutation closures of context-free languages. In this paper, we disprove this conjecture by presenting a language generated by an LBC-grammar that is not a permutation closure of any context-free language. Firstly, we introduce an ad-hoc modification of vector addition systems called linearly-restricted branching vector addition systems with states and additional memory (LRBVASSAMs for short) and prove that the latter are equivalent to LBC-grammars. Then we construct an LRBVASSAM that generates a non-semilinear set and thus disprove Buszkowski's conjecture.Since Buszkowski's conjecture is false, not so much is known about the languages generated by LBC-grammars or by LP-grammars. The equivalence of LRBVASSAMs and LBC-grammars allows us to establish a number of their properties. We show that LP-grammars generate the same class of languages as LBC-grammars; that is, removing product from LP does not decrease expressive power of corresponding categorial grammars. We also prove that this class of languages is closed under union, intersection, concatenation, and Kleene plus.

AB The traditional physical education (PE) teaching management system is usually controlled and managed by a single center, which cannot meet the diversified and personalized teaching needs. Therefore, the research of PE teaching management system based on multi-agent mode has become an important direction. The purpose of this paper was to discuss how to improve the effect and quality of PE teaching and enhance students' learning enthusiasm and initiative through the design of multi-agent mode PE teaching management system. The PE teaching management system based on multi-agent mode provides more flexible and personalized teaching management services by utilizing the cooperation and interaction between agents, realizes the information exchange between teachers and students, provides real-time teaching feedback and evaluation, and promotes the sharing and collaboration of teaching resources. Therefore, the operating efficiency of the conventional physical education management system was the highest at 75% and the lowest at 67%, according to the experimental findings of this paper. The multi-agent model-based management system for physical education had a 95 percent maximum operating efficiency and an 88% minimum operational efficiency. The minimum difference between the two was 21%, and the maximum difference was 20%. It can be seen that the operation efficiency of the physical education management system based on the multi-agent model is more advantageous and more stable.

AB Pansharpening aims at fusing a panchromatic (PAN) image and a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image into a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. In recent years, GAN-based pansharpening methods have achieved excellent results, but they suffer from inadequate feature preservation and unstable training. To address these issues, a novel GAN-based model named TriLossGAN is proposed. This method constructs three loss components with the help of the generator and the dual-discriminator, which are calculated in both the original spatial domain and the transform domain to better preserve high-frequency and low-frequency information in the fused image. Additionally, a new training strategy is designed to stabilize the training process. In extensive experiments, the proposed method achieved satisfactory results on three datasets with QNR values of 0.9584 on GaoFen-2, 0.9601 on QuickBird, and 0.9138 on WorldView-3. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that TriLossGAN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In typical machine learning frameworks, model selection is of fundamental importance: commonly, multiple models have to be trained and compared in order to identify the one with the best predictive performances. The aim of this study is to provide a new tool to improve the model selection process, allowing the user to identify the algorithm which significantly outperforms the other candidates. It proposes a robust model selection procedure based on a multi-aspect permutation test which makes it possible to detect differences in both location and variability between two paired samples of prediction errors. A new extension of the nonparametric combination (NPC) methodology is therefore introduced and is integrated with an appropriate ranking procedure in order to deal with the comparison of C >= 2$$ C\ge 2 $$ candidate models. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the performances of this testing procedure in 2-sample and C$$ C $$-sample problems, by generating data from various well-known distributions and simulating several possible null and alternative scenarios. The adoption of the proposed technique in machine learning model selection problems is then discussed by means of multiple real data applications. These applications confirm what emerges from the simulation study: the introduced NPC-based approach performs well under several different scenarios and represents a valuable tool for robust machine learning model selection.

   information; Label correlation
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is a fine-grained learning paradigm that addresses label ambiguity, yet it confronts the curse of dimensionality. Feature selection is an effective method for dimensionality reduction, and several algorithms have been proposed for LDL that tackle the problem from different views. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection method for LDL. First, an effective LDL model is trained through a classical LDL loss function, which is composed of the maximum entropy model and KL divergence. Then, to select common and label-specific features, their weights are enhanced by l 21-norm and label correlation, respectively. Considering that direct constraint on the parameter by label correlation will make the label-specific features between relevant labels tend to be the same, we adopt the strategy of constraining the maximum entropy output model. Finally, the proposed method will introduce Mutual Information (MI) for the first time in the optimization model for LDL feature selection, which distinguishes similar features thus reducing the influence of redundant features. Experimental results on twelve datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Autonomous robots are one of the critical components in modern manufacturing systems. For this reason, the uninterrupted operation of robots in manufacturing is important for the sustainability of autonomy. Detecting possible fault symptoms that may cause failures within a work environment will help to eliminate interrupted operations. When supervised learning methods are considered, obtaining and storing labeled, historical training data in a manufacturing environment with faults is a challenging task. In addition, sensors in mobile devices such as robots are exposed to different noisy external conditions in production environments affecting data labels and fault mapping. Furthermore, relying on a single sensor data for fault detection often causes false alarms for equipment monitoring. Our study takes requirements into consideration and proposes a new unsupervised machine-learning algorithm to detect possible operational faults encountered by autonomous mobile robots. The method suggests using an ensemble of multi-sensor information fusion at the decision level by voting to enhance decision reliability. The proposed technique relies on dissimilarity-based sensor data segmentation with an adaptive threshold control. It has been tested experimentally on an autonomous mobile robot. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for detecting operational anomalies. Furthermore, the proposed voting mechanism is also capable of eliminating false positives in case of a single source of information is utilized.

DE Human-object interaction (HOI); detection transformer (DETR); learnable
   query; visual relationship detection; fine-tuning
AB Detection transformers (DETR) have provided a novel solution to human-object interaction detection in a set-prediction manner, thanks to expressive learnable queries. However, few studies covered how queries implicitly affect model behaviors, which might contain clues for model improvement. Therefore, we propose two dataset-based analysis tools: score state space and query preference map. They provide data on the distribution of model predictions, which can reveal overall-level and query-level model properties. Starting with our baseline model, we find the model naturally regresses object boxes to overlap human boxes in the edge case of no-object verbs (stand, etc.), even without a related loss. We encourage this by patching the supervision with virtual objects, resulting in more stable query preference. Moreover, we show that two-stage decoders designed for cascade inference do not decouple tasks as intended. We infer this is caused by the empty instances used as negative samples, which suggests a redesign in the matching scheme. Further, we reveal how adding an oracle-query-based teacher model affects query roles with a tiny gain, indicating room for refinement. Our findings demonstrate how a simple focus on query behaviors can provide insights for improving models.

AB With the need of social and economic development, the audit method is also continuously reformed and improved. Traditional audit methods have defects of comprehensively considering various risk factors, and cannot meet the needs of enterprise financial work. To improve the effectiveness of audit work and meet the financial needs of enterprises, a solution for intelligent auditing of enterprise finance is proposed, including intelligent analysis of accounting vouchers and of audit reports. Then, Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network is used to classify the audit problems under three text feature extraction methods. The test results show that the accuracy, recall rate, and F1 value of the COWORDS-IOM algorithm in the aggregate clustering of accounting vouchers are 85.12, 83.28, and 84.85%, respectively, which are better than the self-organizing map algorithm before the improvement. The accuracy rate, recall rate, and F1 value of Word2vec TF-IDF LDA-BiLSTM model for intelligent analysis of audit reports are 87.43, 87.88, and 87.66%, respectively. This shows that the proposed method has good performance in accounting voucher clustering and intelligent analysis of audit reports, which can provide guidance for the development of enterprise financial intelligence software to a certain extent.

AB Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have been proven to be powerful in modeling various real-world networks, such as academic networks and social media networks. By distinguishing the types of relationships and nodes, HINs obtain the capability to model multifarious data, while bringing challenges to data mining and analysis. Specifically, how to comprehensively mine the semantic information in HINs remains an open question. Although recently studied network schemas such as meta-paths or meta-graphs have achieved empirical success, they still have limitations in modeling the complex underlying relations to facilitate the graph neural networks, e.g., different schemas may overlap in semantics and lead to redundant computations. To address this issue, we leverage a recently introduced higher-order network schema known as the motif clique (abbreviated as m-clique). This schema offers greater expressiveness, enabling us to effectively construct the semantic neighborhood of nodes. We further propose a novel heterogeneous graph attention network with m cliques, named HAMC, which employs a two-level attention mechanism (node-level and semantic-level) to learn node representations. The two-level attention measures the importance of neighbors and m-cliques for each node, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed HAMC outperforms the state-of-theart methods in many heterogeneous network analytic tasks such as node classification and clustering. Our code is available at https://github.com/wcx21/HAMC-Heterogeneous-Graph-Attention-Network-with-Motif-Clique.

AB To address the situation where multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems with hesitant fuzzy linguistic evaluation information, this study develops a group decision-making method in view of the individuals best consensus level (BCL) and worst consensus level (WCL) simultaneously. First, several optimization models are constructed for deriving individuals BCL and WCL. The main characteristic of the constructed optimization models is that the personalized individual semantics (PISs) are taken into accounted for different decision-makers. And then, the concept of acceptable consensus level is developed, which considers the BCL and WCL simultaneously. Second, several optimization models are constructed for improving the consensus levels, two predefined thresholds are concerned for the BCL and WCL at the same time. The constrains in the constructed models require all the linguistic evaluation matrices derived from original hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs) meet the threshold of WCL, and there is at least a linguistic evaluation matrix reaches the threshold of BCL. Third, an algorithm is designed for obtaining the priority weights of decision-makers, which takes into accounted the hesitancy degree and average consensus level simultaneously. Finally, the presented method is validated by using a numerical example and extensive comparative analyses.

DE Reinforcement learning; Continual learning; Curiosity; Off-line learning
AB In this work, we investigate the means of using curiosity on replay buffers to improve offlinemulti-task continual reinforcement learning when tasks, which are defined by the non-stationarity in the environment, are non labeled and not evenly exposed to the learner in time. In particular, we investigate the use of curiosity both as a tool for task boundary detection and as a priority metric when it comes to retaining old transition tuples, which we respectively use to propose two different buffers. Firstly, we propose a Hybrid Reservoir Buffer with Task Separation (HRBTS), where curiosity is used to detect task boundaries that are not known due to the task-agnostic nature of the problem. Secondly, by using curiosity as a priority metric when it comes to retaining old transition tuples, a Hybrid Curious Buffer (HCB) is proposed. We ultimately show that these buffers, in conjunction with regular reinforcement learning algorithms, can be used to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue suffered by the state of the art on replay buffers when the agent's exposure to tasks is not equal along time. We evaluate catastrophic forgetting and the efficiency of our proposed buffers against the latest works such as the Hybrid Reservoir Buffer (HRB) and the Multi-Time Scale Replay Buffer (MTR) in three different continual reinforcement learning settings. These settings are defined based on how many times the agent encounters the same task, how long they last, and how different new tasks are when compared to the old ones (i.e., how large the task drift is). The three settings are namely, 1. prolonged task encounter with substantial task drift, and no task re-visitation, 2. frequent, short-lived task encounter with substantial task drift and task re-visitation, and 3. every timestep task encounter with small task drift and task re-visitation. Experiments were done on classical control tasks and Metaworld environment. Experiments show that our proposed replay buffers display better immunity to catastrophic forgetting compared to existing works in all but the every time step task encounter with small task drift and task re-visitation. In this scenario curiosity will always be higher, thus not being an useful measure in both proposed buffers, making them not universally better than other approaches across all types of CL settings, and thereby opening up an avenue for further research.

AB With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) era, the application of intelligent devices in the network is becoming more and more extensive, and the monitoring technology is gradually developing towards the direction of intelligence and digitization. As a hot topic in the field of computer vision, face recognition faces problems such as low level of intelligence and long processing time. Therefore, under the technical support of the IoTs, the research uses internet protocol cameras to collect face information, improves the principal component analysis (PCA), poses a PLV algorithm, and then applies it to the face recognition system for remote monitoring. The outcomes demonstrate that in the Olivetti Research Laboratory face database, the accuracy of PLV is relatively stable, and the highest and lowest are 98 and 94%, respectively. In Yale testing, the accuracy of this algorithm is 12% higher than that of PCA algorithm; In the database of Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), the PLV algorithm requires a time range of 0.2-0.3 seconds and has high operational efficiency. In the selected remote monitoring face database, the accuracy of the method is stable at more than 90%, with the highest being 98%, indicating that it can effectively improve the accuracy of face recognition and provide a reference technical means for further optimization of the remote monitoring system.

AB With the wide popularization of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the design and implementation of intelligent speech equipment have attracted more and more researchers' attention. Speech recognition is one of the core technologies to control intelligent mechanical equipment. An industrial IoT sensor-based broadcast speech recognition and control system is presented to address the issue of integrating a broadcast speech recognition and control system with an IoT sensor for smart cities. In this work, a design approach for creating an intelligent voice control system for the Robot operating system (ROS) is provided. The speech recognition control program for the ROS is created using the Baidu intelligent voice software development kit, and the experiment is run on a particular robot platform. ROS makes use of communication modules to implement network connections between various system modules, mostly via topic-based asynchronous data transmission. A point-to-point network structure serves as the communication channel for the many operations that make up the ROS. The hardware component is mostly made up of the main controller's motor driving module, a power module, a WiFi module, a Bluetooth module, a laser ranging module, etc. According to the experimental findings, the control system can identify the gathered sound signals, translate them into control instructions, and then direct the robot platform to carry out the necessary actions in accordance with the control instructions. Over 95% of speech is recognized. The control system has a high recognition rate and is simple to use, which is what most industrial controls require. It has significant implications for the advancement of control technology and may significantly increase production and life efficiency.

AB In this study, we proposed a fast line-structured light stripe center extraction algorithm based on an improved barycenter algorithm to address the problem that the conventional strip center extraction algorithm cannot meet the requirements of a structured light 3D measurement system in terms of speed and accuracy. First, the algorithm performs pretreatment of the structured light image and obtains the approximate position of the stripe center through skeleton extraction. Next, the normal direction of each pixel on the skeleton is solved using the gray gradient method. Then, the weighted gray center of the gravity method is used to solve the stripe center coordinates along the normal direction. Finally, a smooth strip centerline is fitted using the least squares method. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm achieved significant improvement in speed, sub-pixel level accuracy, and a good structured light stripe center extraction effect, as well as the repeated measurement accuracy of the improved algorithm is within 0.01 mm, and the algorithm has good repeatability.

AB Recently, image inpainting techniques tend to be more concerned with how to enhance the quality of restoration than with how to function on various platforms with limited processing power. In this paper, we propose a lightweight method that combines group convolution and attention mechanism to improve or replace the traditional convolution module. Group convolution was used to achieve multi-level image inpainting, and the authors proposed the rotating attention mechanism for allocation to deal with the issue of information mobility between channels in traditional convolution processing. The parallel discriminator structure was utilized throughout the network's overall design phase to guarantee both local and global consistency of the image inpainting process. The experimental results can demonstrate that, while the quality of image inpainting has been ensured, the proposed image inpainting network's inference time and resource usage are significantly lower than those of comparable lightweight approaches.

AB In this paper, a modified heap-based optimization (HBO) known as the quasi-oppositional heap-based optimization (QOHBO) method is endeavored to tackle the challenging problem of non-convex economic load dispatch problem (ELDP) in large-scale power systems. The QOHBO method leverages a heap data structure to emulate the concept of corporate ranking hierarchy. The mathematical model of HBO is based on the three strategies; first, the interaction between subordinates and their direct superior; second, interactions between contemporaries; third, the employees' self-contribution is adopted to perform both the exploration and exploitation in the search space. To enhance the solution quality and computational efficiency in solving ELDP, we integrate the concept of quasi-oppositional learning into HBO. The proposed QOHBO technique effectively addresses various constraints, including transmission line losses, valve-point loading effects, generator generation limits, prohibited operating zones, power demand compliance, and ramp rate limits. The feasibility of the QOHBO to solve ELDP is evaluated by conducting ten distinct case studies across nine diverse test systems, featuring generating units ranging from three to 140. Comparative analysis with existing techniques from the literature highlights the superior performance of our proposed method in solving large-scale ELD problems. Subsequently, non-parametric alternative tests specifically the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the Friedman test has been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed QOHBO. Moreover, extensive statistical analysis reveals that the QOHBO technique has the ability to consistently provide quality solutions and its robustness when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Many efforts on domain adaptation focus on stationary environments and assume that the target domain samples are available before the learning process. However, real-world applications frequently involve the availability of non-stationary data sequentially. This study develops an unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation approach to address non-stationary scenarios where data streams continually feed the learning model. This process employs a fuzzy-based model that has been trained on a different but related domain. Subsequently, a neighborhood-based weight assignment fine-tunes the attraction and repulsion between neighbors based on prior knowledge about their domains and the similarity between class labels. To avoid unnecessary adaptation for each target domain chunk, domain adaptation is triggered only when concept drift is detected. This way, the model gradually adjusts to the evolving data, incorporating the unique characteristics of the new domain. When no drift is detected, existing parameters are reused for feature adaptation. At the end, the source domain is updated by incorporating the drifting data and their predicted labels. The proposed method offers several advantages, including avoidance of excessive alignment, reduction in domain adaptation cost, and a gradual reduction in dependency on the source domain for domain adaptation. To evaluate the method's performance, experiments were conducted on several tasks extracted from two benchmark datasets, considering different types of concept drift. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves classification accuracy while reducing computational time.

AB In the era of big data, discovering knowledge from incomplete and mixed complex systems is an important research topic that has always been the focus and favor of researchers. Attribute reduction is one of the important research contents in the fields of knowledge discovery, data mining and etc. For improving the performance of attribute reduction, some scholars have proposed many approaches and acceleration mechanisms. As an effective data processing model, the matrix has some bottlenecks in obtaining the reduct efficiently, and there is less research on its accelerated reduction strategies and algorithms. Therefore, the main motivation of this article is to explore and apply various acceleration strategies in matrix reduction methods to improve the efficiency of knowledge discovery in incomplete hybrid decisions systems (IHDSs). First, for incomplete mixed data, the combination tolerance relation is presented. Based on the combination tolerance relation, the corresponding operations and properties of the related matrix are studied, and a matrix-based positive region reduction method is proposed. Next, we develop the incremental computing strategy for updating the matrices to avoid re-calculation and the gradually reducing processing scale strategy for compressing the processing volume in the reduction process; then, two types of matrix-based heuristic reduction acceleration algorithms are designed to obtain a reduct of IHDSs. Finally, some experiments are carried out on nine typical data sets in 15 UCI data sets to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of proposed algorithms.

AB Multiagent cooperation in a partially observable environment without communication is difficult because of the uncertainty of agents. Traditional multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms fail to address this uncertainty. We proposed a MADRL-based policy network architecture called shared mental model-multiagent epistemic planning policy (SMM-MEPP) to resolve this issue. Firstly, this architecture combines multiagent epistemic planning and MADRL to create a "perception-planning-action" multiagent epistemic planning framework, helping multiple agents better handle uncertainty in the absence of coordination. Additionally, by introducing mental models and describing them as neural networks, the parameter-sharing mechanism is used to create shared mental models, maintain the consistency of multiagent planning under the condition of no communication, and improve the efficiency of cooperation. Finally, we applied the SMM-MEPP architecture to three advanced MADRL algorithms (i.e., MAAC, MADDPG, and MAPPO) and conducted comparative experiments in multiagent cooperation tasks. The results show that the proposed method can provide consistent planning for multiple agents and improve the convergence speed or training effect in a partially observable environment without communication.

TI StableNet: Distinguishing the hard samples to overcome language priors

AB With the booming fields of computer vision and natural language processing, cross-modal intersections such as visual question answering (VQA) have become very popular. However, several studies have shown that many VQA models suffer from severe language prior problems. After a series of experiments, the authors found that previous VQA models are in an unstable state, that is, when training is repeated several times on the same dataset, there are significant differences between the distributions of the predicted answers given by the models each time, and these models also perform unsatisfactorily in terms of accuracy. The reason for model instability is that some of the difficult samples bring serious interference to model training, so we design a method to measure model stability quantitatively and further propose a method that can alleviate both model imbalance and instability phenomena. Precisely, the question types are classified into simple and difficult ones different weighting measures are applied. By imposing constraints on the training process for both types of questions, the stability and accuracy of the model improve. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves 63.11% on VQA-CP v2 and 75.49% with the addition of the pre-trained model.
   The authors found that some more complex questions cause instability in the visual question answering model. For this reason, metrics are designed to measure the questions' complexity and the model's stability, and incorporated the weights into the loss function. A large number of experiments demonstrated the superiority of our method.image

AB Recently, as an effective way of learning latent representations, contrastive learning has been increasingly popular and successful in various domains. The success of contrastive learning in single-label classifications motivates us to leverage this learning framework to enhance distinctiveness for better performance in multi-label image classification. In this paper, we show that a direct application of contrastive learning can hardly improve in multi-label cases. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework for multi-label classification with contrastive learning in a fully supervised setting, which learns multiple representations of an image under the context of different labels. This introduces a simple yet intuitive adaption of contrastive learning into our model to boost its performance in multi-label image classification. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in the comparison with the advanced methods in multi-label classification.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence, the most representative deep learning has been applied to various fields, which is greatly influencing human society. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are still a black-box model, and the process how they make decisions internally is still difficult to understand and control. At the same time, DNNs take up more hardware resources, resulting in high energy consumption. Therefore, it is significant to study the characteristics of deep AI models and deeply understand the interactions between parameters within AI models so as to improve the interpretability of DNNs, optimize their structure and increase their computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a graph-based interpretability method for deep neural networks (GIMDNN). The running parameters of DNNs are modeled as a graph by using a kernel function or the Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), where the nodes of the graph are obtained by dimensional mapping of the parameters of the DNNs, and the edges are calculated by the Gaussian kernel function. The generated graphs are classified by a graph convolutional network (GCN). The association relationship between the adjacent layers and the running mechanism of DNNs are analyzed, and the importance of the parameters of each layer in the DNNs for the final classification result can be obtained. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are one of the most representative models in DNNs. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated on the CNNs. The experimental results show that the proposed method can interpret the associations among the weight parameters as well as the correlation between two adjacent layers. Therefore, the DNNs for special tasks, such as portable applications, edge computing, and so on, can be customized, the number of parameters can be reduced. It is valuable to interpret the operation and principle of CNNs.

AB Conditional branch prediction allows the speculative fetching and execution of instructions before knowing the direction of conditional statements. As in other areas, machine learning techniques are a promising approach to building branch predictors, e.g., the Perceptron predictor. However, those traditional solutions demand large input sizes, which impose a considerable area overhead. We propose a conditional branch predictor based on the WiSARD (Wilkie, Stoneham, and Aleksander's Recognition Device) weightless neural network model. The WiSARD-based predictor implements one-shot online training designed to address branch prediction as a binary classification problem. We compare the WiSARD-based predictor with two state-of-the-art predictors: TAGESC-L (TAgged GEometric-Statistical Corrector-Loop) and the Multiperspective Perceptron. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposed predictor, with a smaller input size, outperforms the perceptron-based predictor by about 0.09% and achieves similar accuracy to that of TAGE-SC-L. In addition, we perform an experimental sensitivity analysis to find the best predictor for each dataset, and based on these results, we designed new specialized predictors using a particular parameter composition for each dataset. The results show that the specialized WiSARD-based predictor outperforms the state-of-the-art by more than 2.3% in the best case. Furthermore, through the implementation of specialized predictor classifiers, we discovered that utilizing 90% of the specialized predictor for a specific dataset yielded comparable performance to the corresponding specialized predictor.

DT Article
DE Global Pooling; Convolutional Neural Networks; Entropy; Classification;
   Computer vision
AB We propose a novel Global Entropy Pooling (GEP) layer for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is the first approach that uses the Entropy value directly for pooling rather than creating a weighting mechanism for feature maps obtained via convolution. This way, we use the "amount" of information (expressed by Entropy) to describe the feature maps in contrast to the most commonly used averaging (Global Average Pooling, GAP). We use our method in a rather unusual way. We replace GAP with GEP and use the same feature extractor and classifier weights for the prediction - with no additional training. Our layer can be easily integrated (instead of the GAP layer) into various pre-trained CNN models. From a technical perspective, it is possible to integrate GEP without additional training, because it does not contain any parameters that have to be trained. Also, its input and output have the same format as the GAP's one. We examine how the replacement impacts the model behavior. Despite a completely different form of pooling, utilization of the GEP layer in the examined pre-trained models (InceptionV3, Xception and InceptionResNetV2) allowed us to obtain some accuracy improvements in comparison to the original networks on the subsets of the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, networks modified with our layer exhibit an interesting property - they are more "confident" in the predictions they return. It manifests itself through higher values of the probabilities assigned to correctly predicted classes. This opens a possibility to use not only the initial layers of the pretrained network, but also to modify network's middle parts and reuse its classifier trained on an original model as well.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Extracting user preferences and item features from reviews to assist recommendations is becoming increasingly popular. However, on the one hand, existing works generally select reviews based on how well user reviews match item reviews. They ignore that reviews may contain noise such as irrelevant phrases, which will affect the accuracy of selecting important reviews. In contrast, summaries written by users are abstracts of reviews that contain critical item feature information. They can be adopted to identify crucial reviews and further capture user's fine-grained preferences from reviews. In addition, current methods do not consider that different items have different aspects in the same domain. They normally set a fixed number of aspects of the entire domain to get coarse-grained user preferences and item features. However, when modeling the user's preferences for the current item, it might be more important to capture the corresponding aspects of the item preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a Summary-Aware Multi-Aspect Recommendation (SMAR). Specifically, we first construct a Summary-Aware Review Selection Module which adopts summaries to alleviate noise in reviews, identifying key reviews accurately. We then design a Summary Aware Multi-Aspect Module which captures targeted user preferences towards the current item's aspects. Finally, we employ Latent Factor Model to complete the recommendation process. The experimental results on Amazon datasets show that our method significantly outperfoms state-of-art approaches in terms of rating prediction accuracy.

AB We devise in this paper a Multilevel Adaptive Reduction Technique (MART) for time series data. MART extracts the main features of a time series and encodes them in a reduced data structure called reduct. The extracted features are leveraged to establish a distance between reducts that satisfies the lower bounding constraint. Furthermore, we show how MART can be further applied on the reduced data and operate at different levels.

   Similarity-oriented tasks; Synonym knowledge enhancement
AB Contextual synonym knowledge is crucial for those similarity-oriented tasks whose core challenge lies in capturing semantic similarity between entities in their contexts, such as entity linking and entity matching. However, most Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) lack synonym knowledge due to inherent limitations of their pre-training objectives such as masked language modeling (MLM). Existing works which inject synonym knowledge into PLMs often suffer from two severe problems: (i) Neglecting the ambiguity of synonyms, and (ii) Undermining semantic understanding of original PLMs, which is caused by inconsistency between the exact semantic similarity of the synonyms and the broad conceptual relevance learned from the original corpus. To address these issues, we propose PICSO, a flexible framework that supports the injection of contextual synonym knowledge from multiple domains into PLMs via a novel entity-aware Adapter which focuses on the semantics of the entities (synonyms) in the contexts. Meanwhile, PICSO stores the synonym knowledge in additional parameters of the Adapter structure, which prevents it from corrupting the semantic understanding of the original PLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICSO can dramatically outperform the original PLMs and the other knowledge and synonym injection models on four different similarity-oriented tasks. In addition, experiments on GLUE prove that PICSO also benefits general natural language understanding tasks. Codes and data will be public.

AB Computer vision and deep learning have made substantial progress in the areas of agriculture and smart farming, particularly for enhancing crop production using image segmentation techniques for crop yield prediction. Further improvements to crop yield prediction results can be achieved by developing accurate and efficient methods. In response to such demands, this paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network architecture, called densely connected SegNet (D-SegNet) and demonstrates its advantages on plant segmentation using a new morning glory plant dataset, and also on a complimentary publicly available dataset to promote research in this direction. The D-SegNet is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. It achieves performance better than the state-of-the-art SegNet algorithm. The evaluated precision, recall and F1-score values are 98.20%, 90.64% and 94.26%, respectively, for the morning glory plant dataset. The intersection over union (IoU) value in the image segmentation tasks is 90.56%. A series of experiments on the morning glory plant dataset as well as on the publicly available dataset were conducted. The results show that the proposed method achieves accurate segmentation results and can be useful for assessing the plant weight during harvesting. In summary, this new plant segmentation network, D-SegNet, could form an important component of future cloud-based machine learning systems to predict crop yield from noisy smartphone images taken in the field.

AB Image change detection is important in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image analysis and interpretation. However, improving its accuracy is challenging because of the interference of multiplicative speckle noise. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised PolSAR image change detection method based on a multiscale graph convolutional network (GCN). First, a Shannon entropy difference image is introduced and improved to obtain an enhanced difference image (EDI) that can effectively suppress speckle noise while preserving edge information. The generated EDI can be further utilised to construct a pseudo-label set required for unsupervised change detection. Subsequently, a difference constraint joint graph construction (DCJGC) module is proposed to obtain the object-level input information of the network. This uses the joint superpixels of multitemporal PolSAR images as graph nodes, and then introduces the difference information in the EDI to constrain the formation process of the edges between the nodes, efficiently and accurately constructing undirected graphs. Finally, a difference-guided multiscale GCN (DGMGCN) is designed for PolSAR image change detection. The network utilises difference information to eliminate the adverse effect of speckle noise on change detection and fully capture the change-aware features of multitemporal PolSAR images at fine and coarse scales, thereby improving feature discriminability. Experimental results on six real Gaofen-3 PolSAR datasets validate the superiority of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods.

DE Domain adaptation; Selected confidence sample labeling; Discriminative
   progressively labeling; Consistency strategy; Differential learning
AB Unsupervised Domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Recently, to achieve reliable knowledge learning, progressively labeling (PL) is proposed to select reliable target samples for training. Although PL achieves fruitful results, there are two problems that limit its performance: (a) PL may neglect to filter out the uncertain samples that lie in the classification boundaries, which might select low-quality target samples for training, and lead to error accumulations; and (b) PL might overlook the consistent selection in the sample selection stage during iteration, which might result in unstable sample selection. To cope with these problems, we propose a novel method called Selected Confidence Sample Labeling (SCSL). SCSL consists of three parts: Discriminative Progressively Labeling (DPL), Consistency Strategy (CS), and Differential Learning (DL). First, DPL selects the high-confidence target samples with the maximum probability difference between the highest and the second highest probabilities of classification. In this way, the uncertain samples are filtered out, while the qualities of the selected target samples are ensured. Second, CS includes a group of consistency strategies to make the selected high-confidence target samples near to the class-centroids. This further improves the confidence degree of the selected target samples, and ensures that the proposed model does not remove or replace the selected target samples during iteration. At last, DL is a bi-strategic training approach that applies CS and top -k fuzzy probability clustering to train the high-confidence and the remaining target samples, respectively. In doing so, all the target samples are trained simultaneously, and the generalization of the model is improved. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets with the comparison of several advanced algorithms demonstrate the superiority of SCSL.

DE Video object segmentation; Transformer; Attention mechanism
AB Video object segmentation automatically separates the interested objects from the background across a video sequence and was an active research area in recent years. The crucial challenge lies in investigating an effective architecture to fully exploit spatiotemporal correlation in a given video sequence for achieving accurate segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised Transformer-based framework called Target-guided Spatiotemporal Dual-stream Transformers (TSDT) with two separate streams to enable effective spatiotemporal context propagation. Technically, the temporal stream is used to aggregate rich temporal cues from past frames, while the spatial stream is trained to encode object location and appearance information stored in the current frame. To compress and integrate temporal features, a target guidance block (TGB) is designed to retrieve target information in the past video flow under the guidance of the current frame. The experimental results on video object segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Codes and trained models are available at https://github.com/zhouweii234/TSDTVOS.

DE Natural language processing; Sentence BERT; Manifold learning; Local
   geometric structure
AB Distributed sentence representations have shown great power in a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized sentence representation, called Sentence BERT (SBERT), achieves excellent performance in quite a few NLP tasks. However, Sentence BERT is typically learned in the Euclidean space, the geometric structure of sentence representations and their relations to the representations of sentence's contexts has not been carefully studied yet. In this paper, we propose a new sentence representation method, named Refined SBERT, which utilizes manifold learning to refine sentence BERT by re-embedding sentence vectors from the original embedding space to a new refined semantic space. In order to map sentences to manifold space, we utilize neighborhood preserving embedding to construct the local manifold structure of the sentences. Our method can discover the local geometric structure and obtain a compact sentence BERT subspace, which can best detect the essential semantic structure. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various sentence embedding tasks including semantic textual similarity tasks, text classification and document clustering, and the experimental results show that the proposed model achieved promising results, comparing to several popular sentence representations.

AB Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most popular neural network optimization algorithms, has a solid theoretical foundation as well as good generalization performance. However vanilla SGD performs catastrophically in Binary Neural Networks (BNNs). Many studies have identified this phenomenon without explaining its causes in depth. In this paper, we try to experimentally understand the possible reasons for this and significantly improve the performance of vanilla SGD in BNNs training by adjusting the training strategy to be comparable to Adam. We subsequently propose a new optimization method for training deep neural networks (DNNs) with binary weights. In the proposed SGD with Adaptive Threshold, referred to as SGDAT, we suppress the frequency of weights flipping by thresholds and adjust the threshold of each parameter according to the number of flipping to further reduce the network noise, stabilize the network training, and improve the network generalization ability. Also, we present a complete ablation study of the hyperparameters space, as well as experimentally analyze the impact of using adaptive thresholds. Furthermore, we conduct image classification experiments over the CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets using BinaryNet and ResNet-18 network structure. The experiments show that SGDAT outperforms other binary optimizers. Code is available at: https://github.com/ gushan/SGDAT.

TI Meta-survey on outlier and anomaly detection

DE Anomaly detection; Outlier detection; Meta-survey
ID NOVELTY DETECTION
AB The impact of outliers and anomalies on model estimation and data processing is of paramount importance, as evidenced by the extensive body of research spanning various fields over several decades: thousands of research papers have been published on the subject. As a consequence, numerous reviews, surveys, and textbooks have sought to summarize the existing literature, encompassing a wide range of methods from both the statistical and data mining communities. While these endeavors to organize and summarize the research are invaluable, they face inherent challenges due to the pervasive nature of outliers and anomalies in all data-intensive applications, irrespective of the specific application field or scientific discipline. As a result, the resulting collection of papers remains voluminous and somewhat heterogeneous. To address the need for knowledge organization in this domain, this paper implements the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection. Employing a classical systematic survey approach, the study collects nearly 500 papers using two specialized scientific search engines. From this comprehensive collection, a subset of 56 papers that claim to be general surveys on outlier detection is selected using a snowball search technique to enhance field coverage. A meticulous quality assessment phase further refines the selection to a subset of 25 high-quality general surveys. Using this curated collection, the paper investigates the evolution of the outlier detection field over a 20-year period, revealing emerging themes and methods. Furthermore, an analysis of the surveys sheds light on the survey writing practices adopted by scholars from different communities who have contributed to this field. Finally, the paper delves into several topics where consensus has emerged from the literature. These include taxonomies of outlier types, challenges posed by high-dimensional data, the importance of anomaly scores, the impact of learning conditions, difficulties in benchmarking, and the significance of neural networks. Nonconsensual aspects are also discussed, particularly the distinction between local and global outliers and the challenges in organizing detection methods into meaningful taxonomies.

AB You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithms deliver state-of-the-art performance in object detection. This research proposes a novel one-stage YOLO-based algorithm that explicitly models the spatial context inherent in traffic scenes. The new YOLO*C algorithm introduces the MCTX context module and integrates loss function changes, effectively leveraging rich global context information. The performance of YOLO*C models is tested on BDD100K traffic data with multiple context variables. The results show that including context improves YOLO detection results without losing efficiency. Smaller models report the most significant improvements. The smallest model accomplished more than a 10% increase in mAP .5 compared to the baseline YOLO model. Modified YOLOv7 outperformed all models on mAP .5, including two-stage and transformer-based detectors, available at the dataset zoo. The analysis shows that improvement mainly results from better detection of smaller traffic objects, which presents a significant detection challenge within the complex traffic environment.

By selecting appropriate Lyapunov functional and utilizing the Kronecker product, several network synchronization criteria are formulated. Moreover, since networks suffering attacks may not be synchronized in some circumstances, two simple controllers are also developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the devised control schemes are verified through two numerical examples.

AB Human social learning is an effective process that has inspired many existing machine learning approaches, such as learning from observation and learning by demonstration. In this paper, we introduce another form of social learning, learning from a casual conversation or LCC a machine learning approach in which an artificially intelligent agent learns new information through an extended natural language dialog with a human. Our system enables the agent to add or change information in its knowledge base as a result of the human's conversational text inputs. LCC seeks to close an important gap in the state of the art that has focused on teaching computer agents how to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, LCC could also provide an efficient way to enhance the knowledge base of certain types of systems without requiring the involvement of a programmer. LCC does not require the user to enter specific information; instead, the user can converse naturally with the agent. As part of its learning process, LCC identifies the text inputs from the conversing human that contain information worth learning, and then determines whether the inputs are heretofore unknown and learns it; in agreement with what it already "knows" and ignores it; or in conflict with what it "knows" and it must resolve the conflict. LCC's architecture consists of multiple sub-systems combined to perform the above tasks. Its learning component can add new information to the knowledge base, confirm existing information, and/or update existing information found to be related to the user input. The LCC system functionality was rigorously assessed with test statements comprising various difficulty levels. Furthermore, its acceptance by human users was evaluated by two separate groups of human test subjects-one group who interacted with the system, and a second group that evaluated the logs of the interactions of the first group. The collected results were all found to be acceptable and within the range of our expectations.

AB Individual and societal systems are open systems continuously affected by their situational context. In recent years, context sources have been increasingly considered in different domains to aid short and long-term forecasts of systems' behavior. Nevertheless, available research generally disregards the role of prospective context, such as calendrical planning or weather forecasts. This work proposes a multiple-input neural architecture consisting of a sequential composition of long short-term memory units or temporal convolutional networks able to incorporate both historical and prospective sources of situational context to aid time series forecasting tasks. Considering urban case studies, we further assess the impact that different sources of external context have on medical emergency and mobility forecasts. Results show that the incorporation of external context variables, including calendrical and weather variables, can significantly reduce forecasting errors against state-of-the-art forecasters. In particular, the incorporation of prospective context, generally neglected in related work, mitigates error increases along the forecasting horizon.

AB High average-utility itemset mining is a subfield of data mining that has extensive practical applications. However, it is difficult for users to determine a proper minimum threshold because they cannot accurately predict the number of patterns mined at a given threshold. To address this issue, top-k high average-utility itemset mining has been proposed where k is the number of high average-utility itemsets to be mined. In this paper, we design an effective algorithm (named ETAUIM) for finding top-k high average-utility itemsets. ETAUIM employs a breadth-first search strategy to efficiently explore the search space, and it utilizes a tighter upper bound instead of the average-utility upper bound to limit the search space. Additionally, ETAUIM removes irrelevant items during the mining process and utilizes an early abandoning strategy to terminate unnecessary join operations in advance. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted on six sparse datasets and two dense datasets. Four state-of-the-art algorithms were used for comparison. The experimental results show that ETAUIM has excellent performance and scalability. Moreover, ETAUIM always performs better for sparse datasets.

DE Weakly-supervised Learning; Noisy Label Learning; Supervised Contrastive
   Learning; Prototype Contrastive Learning
AB Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in the artificial intelligence community and various downstream tasks. They encode images or texts into dense feature representations and are supervised by a large amount of labeled data. Due to the expensiveness of high-quality labeled data, a huge number of easy-to-access instances are collected to conduct supervised learning. However, they have not been annotated by experts and thus can contain numerous noisy instances, which will degrade the performance. To learn robust feature representations despite misleading noisy labels, we employ supervised contrastive learning to directly perform supervision in the hidden space, rather than in the prediction space like the prevalent cross-entropy loss function. However, cutting-edge noisy label learning methods with supervised contrastive learning always discard the data considered to be noisy, and thus cannot tolerate high-ratio noisy datasets. Therefore, we propose a novel training strategy named Supervised Contrastive Learning with Corrected Labels (ScL2) to defend against the attack of noisy labels. ScL2 corrects the noisy labels with an empirical small-loss assumption and conducts supervised contrastive learning using these corrected data. Specifically, we employ the generated soft labels as supervisory information to facilitate our implementation of supervised contrastive learning. This expansion of contrastive learning ensures the integrity of the supervisory information while effectively enhancing the learning process. In addition, samples sharing the same soft labels are treated as positive sample pairs, while those with different soft labels are considered to be negative sample pairs. With this strategy, the representations from neural networks keep the local discrimination in one mini-batch. Besides, we also employ a prototype contrastive learning technique to ensure global discrimination. Our ScL2 has demonstrated excellent performance on numerous benchmark datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in various standardized evaluation scenarios. Additionally, our model has proven to be highly valuable when applied to real-world noisy datasets.

AB Learning dynamical systems in a sample-efficient way is important for model-based control. Active learning which sequentially selects the most informative data to sample is capable of greatly reducing sample complexity. The active learning problem for dynamical systems is hard as we can not arbitrarily draw samples from the system's state space under constraints of system dynamics. The existing approaches model the dynamical systems using Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian processes which can not be applied to complex dynamical systems with high-dimensional state spaces. In this article, we propose a new method to actively learn dynamical systems using Bayesian neural networks which allow for modeling high-dimensional systems with complex dynamics. By maximizing the accumulated differential entropies along the trajectory, the proposed method iteratively searches for the most informative action sequence which will yield informative samples when applied to the real system. With random exploration and model-based reinforcement learning as baselines, we verify the superiority of the proposed method via accuracy of one-step and multi-step predictions, the control performance, the exploration efficiency of the state space on numerical benchmarks.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The multiple distinct yet related manufacturing processes running in a shop floor usually necessitates modeling these processes individually. However, the amount of collected data is imbalanced among these processes due to different production rates. Therefore, industrial knowledge transfer has been extensively investigated through transfer learning and continual learning. Existing work mostly assumes the availability of entire dataset prior to modeling, ignoring that real manufacturing data often arrives sequentially in a non-stationary stream. Some recent studies enable the model to adapt to such data stream, yet they fail to consider the frequent alternation of multiple processes. To address these issues, a novel paradigm is proposed in this paper for the continual knowledge transfer in modeling multiple manufacturing processes. The proposed paradigm takes into account both linear and non-linear model families. For linear models, the Intercept Separated Recursive Least Squares (IS-RLS) algorithm with variable forgetting factors is introduced that transfers the knowledge about disturbances. For non-linear models, the important parameters of source domain model are dynamically identified and transferred based on the formulation of a neural network with Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) and variable learning rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on two shop floors of a large factory. The collected data streams involve multiple product categories with diverse production rates. The proposed paradigm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvement over baselines. The results can boost the practical applications of process modeling in large-scale manufacturing.

AB Privacy preserving utility mining (PPUM) aims to solve the problem of sensitive information leakage in utility pattern mining. In recent years, researchers have proposed algorithms to solve the privacy-preserving problem. However, these algorithms have high side effects, long sanitization time, and computational complexity. Although the FPUTT algorithm reduces the number of database scans, tree construction and traversal still take much time. The paper proposes a fast utility-list dictionary algorithm (FULD). The utility-list dictionary consists of all sensitive items. Through dictionary lookup, sensitive items can be found and modified. In addition, the novel concepts of SINS and tns are proposed to reduce the side effects of the algorithm. In this paper, the experiments show that the FULD algorithm has good performance, such as running time and side effects. The running time of the FULD is 15-20 times shorter than the FPUTT algorithm. It performs well both on sparse and dense datasets.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB An improved method for recognising clouds on the ground map is proposed incorporating the DeepLabV3+ model to solve three issues. Firstly, an image preprocessing module is developed to enrich image quality, particularly at night, as clouds can appear to be too blurry to distinguish. Secondly, the CBAM attention mechanism is applied to safeguard texture and boundary information, ensuring the depiction of cirrus edges is not lost. Finally, the feature extraction network can be optimised to enhance the model and decrease its computational complexity. In comparison to the original model, the accuracy of the proposed method increased by 10.89%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 94.18%. Furthermore, the MIoU has improved from 66.02% to 79.31%. The number of parameters was reduced by 51.45% to 13.4 M. Of the various cloud types, the improvement in cirrus is particularly striking, with the MIoU increasing from 1.78% to 56.01%.

AB Interactive Sonification is a well-known guidance method in navigation tasks. Researchers have repeatedly suggested the use of interactive sonification in neuronavigation and image-guided surgery. The hope is to reduce clinicians' cognitive load through a relief of the visual channel, while preserving the precision provided through image guidance. In this paper, we present a surgical use case, simulating a craniotomy preparation with a skull phantom. Through auditory, visual, and audiovisual guidance, non-clinicians successfully find targets on a skull that provides hardly any visual or haptic landmarks. The results show that interactive sonification enables novice users to navigate through three-dimensional space with a high precision. The precision along the depth axis is highest in the audiovisual guidance mode, but adding audio leads to higher durations and longer motion trajectories.

AB Since the advent of Transformers followed by Vision Transformers (ViTs), enormous success has been achieved by researchers in the field of computer vision and object detection. The difficulty mechanism of splitting images into fixed patches posed a serious challenge in this arena and resulted in loss of useful information at the time of object detection and classification. To overcome the challengers, we propose an innovative Intelligent-based patching mechanism and integrated it seamlessly into the conventional Patch-based ViT framework. The proposed method enables the utilization of patches with flexible sizes to capture and retain essential semantic content from input images and therefore increases the performance compared with conventional methods. Our method was evaluated with three renowned datasets Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MSCOCO-2017), Pascal VOC (Visual Object Classes Challenge) and Cityscapes upon object detection and classification. The experimental results showed promising improvements in specific metrics, particularly in higher confidence thresholds, making it a notable performer in object detection and classification tasks.

AB This article presents a detailed investigation into the Multi-Depot Half-Open Time-Dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (MDHOTDEVRP) within the domain of urban distribution, prompted by the growing urgency to mitigate the environmental repercussions of logistics transportation. The study first surmounts the uncertainty in Electric Vehicle (EV) range arising from the dynamic nature of urban traffic networks by establishing a flexible energy consumption estimation strategy. Subsequently, a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model is formulated, aiming to minimize the total distribution costs associated with EV dispatch, vehicle travel, customer service, and charging operations. Given the unique attributes intrinsic to the model, a Two-Stage Hybrid Ant Colony Algorithm (TSHACA) is developed as an effective solution approach. The algorithm leverages enhanced K-means clustering to assign customers to EVs in the first stage and employs an Improved Ant Colony Algorithm (IACA) for optimizing the distribution within each cluster in the second stage. Extensive simulations conducted on various test scenarios corroborate the economic and environmental benefits derived from the MDHOTDEVRP solution and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. The outcomes highlight TSHACA's capability to efficiently allocate EVs from different depots, optimize vehicle routes, reduce carbon emissions, and minimize urban logistic expenditures. Consequently, this study contributes significantly to the advancement of sustainable urban logistics transportation, offering valuable insights for practitioners and policy-makers.

   network; Deep learning
AB Light guide plate (LGP) is a key component of liquid crystal display (LCD) display systems, so its quality directly affects the display effect of LCD. However, LGPs have complex background texture, low contrast, varying defect size and numerous defect types, which makes realizing efficient and accuracy-satisfactory surface defect automatic detection of LGPS still a big challenge. Therefore, combining its optical properties, dot distribution, defect imaging characteristics and detection requirements, a surface defect detection algorithm based on LGP-YOLO for practical industrial applications is proposed in this paper. To enhance the feature extraction ability of the network without dimensionality reduction, expand the effective receptive field and reduce the interference of invalid targets, we built the receptive field module (RFM) by combining the effective channel attention network (ECA-Net) and reviewing large kernel design in CNNs (RepLKNet). For the purpose of optimizing the performance of the network in downstream tasks, enhance the network's expression ability and improve the network's ability of detecting multi-scale targets, we construct the small detection module (SDM) by combining space-to-depth non-strided convolution (SPDConv) and omini-dimensional dynamic convolution (ODConv). Finally, an LGP defect dataset is constructed using a set of images collected from industrial sites, and a multi-round experiment is carried out to test the proposed method on the LGP detect dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed LGP-YOLO network can achieve high performance, with mAP and F1-score reaching 99.08% and 97.45% respectively, and inference speed reaching 81.15 FPS. This demonstrates that LGP-YOLO can strike a good balance between detection accuracy and inference speed, capable of meeting the requirements of high-precision and high-efficiency LGP defect detection in LGP manufacturing factories.

AB The design of binder proteins for specific target proteins using deep learning is a challenging task that has a wide range of applications in both designing therapeutic antibodies and creating new drugs. Machine learning-based solutions, as opposed to laboratory design, streamline the design process and enable the design of new proteins that may be required to address new and orphan diseases. Most techniques proposed in the literature necessitate either domain knowledge or some appraisal of the target protein's 3-D structure. This paper proposes an approach for designing binder proteins based solely on the amino acid sequence of the target protein and without recourse to domain knowledge or structural information. The sequences of the binders are generated with two new transformers, namely the AppendFormer and MergeFormer architectures. Because, in general, there is more than one binder for a given target protein, these transformers employ a binding score and a prior on the sequence of the binder to obtain a unique targeted solution. Our experimental evaluation confirms the strengths of this novel approach. The performance of the models was determined with 5-fold cross-validation and clearly indicates that our architectures lead to highly accurate results. In addition, scores of up to 0.98 were achieved in terms of Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman similarity metrics, which indicates that our solutions significantly outperform a seq2seq baseline model.

AB This paper proposes a novel algorithm named surrogate ensemble assisted differential evolution with efficient dual differential grouping (SEADECC-EDDG) to deal with large-scale expensive optimization problems (LSEOPs) based on the CC framework. In the decomposition phase, our proposed EDDG inherits the framework of efficient recursive differential grouping (ERDG) and embeds the multiplicative interaction identification technique of Dual DG (DDG), which can detect the additive and multiplicative interactions simultaneously without extra fitness evaluation consumption. Inspired by RDG2 and RDG3, we design the adaptive determination threshold and further decompose relatively large-scale sub-components to alleviate the curse of dimensionality. In the optimization phase, the SEADE is adopted as the basic optimizer, where the global and the local surrogate model are constructed by generalized regression neural network (GRNN) with all historical samples and Gaussian process regression (GPR) with recent samples. Expected improvement (EI) infill sampling criterion cooperated with random search is employed to search elite solutions in the surrogate model. To evaluate the performance of our proposal, we implement comprehensive experiments on CEC2013 benchmark functions compared with state-of-the-art decomposition techniques. Experimental and statistical results show that our proposed EDDG is competitive with these advanced decomposition techniques, and the introduction of SEADE can accelerate the convergence of optimization significantly.

AB Trade-offs between producing costly movements for gathering information ('explore') and using previously acquired information to achieve a goal ('exploit') arise in a wide variety of problems, including foraging, reinforcement learning and sensorimotor control. Determining the optimal balance between exploration and exploitation is computationally intractable, necessitating heuristic solutions. Here we show that the electric fish Eigenmannia virescens uses a salience-dependent mode-switching strategy to solve the explore-exploit conflict during a refuge-tracking task in which the same category of movement (fore-aft swimming) is used for both gathering information and achieving task goals. The fish produced distinctive non-Gaussian distributions of movement velocities characterized by sharp peaks for slower, task-oriented 'exploit' movements and broad shoulders for faster 'explore' movements. The measures of non-normality increased with increased sensory salience, corresponding to a decrease in the prevalence of fast explore movements. We found the same sensory salience-dependent mode-switching behaviour across ten phylogenetically diverse organisms, from amoebae to humans, performing tasks such as postural balance and target tracking. We propose a state-uncertainty-based mode-switching heuristic that reproduces the distinctive velocity distribution, rationalizes modulation by sensory salience and outperforms the classic persistent excitation approach while using less energy. This mode-switching heuristic provides insights into purposeful exploratory behaviours in organisms, as well as a framework for more efficient state estimation and control of robots.
   Organisms show complex behaviour resulting from a trade-off between obtaining information (explore) and using current information (exploit). Biswas et al. observe a mode-switching strategy modulated by sensory salience in a diverse range of organisms, including electric fish and humans, and argue that the observed heuristic could inform the design of active-sensing behaviours in robotics.

TI Deep learning of causal structures in high dimensions under data

ID NETWORKS; INFERENCE; LATENT
AB Causal learning is a key challenge in scientific artificial intelligence as it allows researchers to go beyond purely correlative or predictive analyses towards learning underlying cause-and-effect relationships, which are important for scientific understanding as well as for a wide range of downstream tasks. Here, motivated by emerging biomedical questions, we propose a deep neural architecture for learning causal relationships between variables from a combination of high-dimensional data and prior causal knowledge. We combine convolutional and graph neural networks within a causal risk framework to provide an approach that is demonstrably effective under the conditions of high dimensionality, noise and data limitations that are characteristic of many applications, including in large-scale biology. In experiments, we find that the proposed learners can effectively identify novel causal relationships across thousands of variables. Results include extensive (linear and nonlinear) simulations (where the ground truth is known and can be directly compared against), as well as real biological examples where the models are applied to high-dimensional molecular data and their outputs compared against entirely unseen validation experiments. These results support the notion that deep learning approaches can be used to learn causal networks at large scale.
   Learning causal relationships between variables in large datasets is an outstanding challenge in various scientific applications. Lagemann et al. introduce a deep neural network approach combining convolutional and graph models intended for causal learning in high-dimensional biomedical problems.

TI Design of prime-editing guide RNAs with deep transfer learning
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Prime editors (PEs) are promising genome-editing tools, but effective optimization of prime-editing guide RNA (pegRNA) design remains a challenge owing to the lack of accurate and broadly applicable approaches. Here we develop Optimized Prime Editing Design (OPED), an interpretable nucleotide language model that leverages transfer learning to improve its accuracy and generalizability for the efficiency prediction and design optimization of pegRNAs. Comprehensive validations on various published datasets demonstrate its broad applicability in efficiency prediction across diverse scenarios. Notably, pegRNAs with high OPED scores consistently show significantly increased editing efficiencies. Furthermore, the versatility and efficacy of OPED in design optimization are confirmed by efficiently installing various ClinVar pathogenic variants using optimized pegRNAs in the PE2, PE3/PE3b and ePE editing systems. OPED consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. We construct the OPEDVar database of optimized designs from over two billion candidates for all pathogenic variants and provide a user-friendly web application of OPED for any desired edit.
   Prime editors are innovative genome-editing tools, but selecting guide RNAs with high efficiency remains challenging and requires costly experimental efforts. Liu and colleagues develop a method to design prime-editing guide RNAs based on transfer learning for in silico prediction of editing efficacy.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online education, yielding increased attention on knowledge tracing (KT). KT involves predicting a student's mastery of knowledge based on the student's learning activity and plays a crucial role for recommending appropriate educational content at the individual level. While several deep learning-based KT models have been proposed, most consider only the interaction sequence of the target student, ignoring the interactions of other students. Furthermore, in practice, all model graphs should be incremented as more student interaction data is obtained, implying that they should be rebuilt to remain up-to-date, which is time-consuming. Moreover, existing graph-based KT models typically rely on predefined knowledge graphs for graph-based learning. Constructing a knowledge graph is labor-intensive, requiring a higher understanding of the domain knowledge. To address these problems, we propose a new inductive graph-based KT (IGKT) framework, which fully utilizes a subgraph extraction approach from a student-exercise bipartite graph, promising scalability and efficiency for practical applicability. The proposed framework consists of three key components: subsequence extraction, subgraph extraction and exericse information addition, and graph-based correctness prediction. For the third component, we test three variants to determine the effectiveness of integrating the timestamp and graph information, thereby creating three models for comparison: IGKT-Basic, IGKT with timestamps (IGKT-TS), and IGKT with graph attention layers that incorporate timestamps as edge features (IGKT-GAT). Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets show that the models based on the proposed framework are superior over state-of-the-art models, and IGKT-GAT is the most effective implementation of the proposed framework. We further validate the effectiveness of the IGKT models through an ablation study and multiple in-depth analyses.

DE Credit assignment; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Reward
   decomposition; Heterogeneous agents
AB Credit assignment poses a significant challenge in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) when tackling fully cooperative tasks. Existing MARL methods assess the contribution of each agent through value decomposition or agent-wise critic networks. However, value decomposition techniques are not directly applicable to control problems with continuous action spaces. Additionally, agent-wise critic networks struggle to differentiate the distinct contributions from the shared team reward. Moreover, most of these methods assume agent homogeneity, which limits their utility in more diverse scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a novel algorithm that factorizes and reshapes the team reward into agent-wise rewards, enabling the evaluation of the diverse contributions of heterogeneous agents. Specifically, we devise agent-wise local critics that leverage both the team reward and the factorized reward, alongside a global critic for assessing the joint policy. By accounting for the contribution differences resulting from agent heterogeneity, we introduce a power balance constraint that ensures a fairer measurement of each heterogeneous agent's contribution, ultimately promoting energy efficiency. Finally, we optimize the policies of all agents using deterministic policy gradients. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm has been validated through simulation experiments conducted in fully cooperative and heterogeneous multi-agent tasks.

AB As an essential part of geocoding, address matching has gained increasing research attention. Due to the long-distance dependency and unstructured property, existing address-matching methods hardly capture the contextual and implicit semantic information of unstructured text addresses. This paper presents a Contrastive Learning model based on Global and Local representation Interaction for Address Matching (referred to as CLGLIAM), which introduces a novel global and local interaction network to enhance the discrimination ability of the model on the hard negative address by associating the relationship between the global and local address representation explicitly. Simultaneously, to improve the generalization and transferability of the model, we utilize contrastive learning to enrich the data sample and extricate the model from task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted on Shenzhen and national address datasets to verify the effectiveness of our approach. Our model achieves state-of-the-art F1 scores of 99.26 and 98.50 on the two datasets, respectively. And the extended hard negative experiments further demonstrate the better performance of CLGLIAM in terms of semantic discrimination.

AB Invisibility, robustness and payload are three indispensable and contradictory properties for any image watermarking systems. Recently, to achieve the tradeoff among above three requirements, statistical watermarking schemes have gained a lot of attention. Most existing approaches, however, often bear a number of drawbacks, in particular: (i) They all employ directly transform coefficients, which are always fragile to some attacks, for watermark embedding and statistical modeling; (ii) The adopted model cannot capture accurately the statistical distributions of the transform coefficients; (iii) Most of them simply use the linear function for watermark embedding, which often either miss higher capacity or may cause visible distortions. This has motivated us to introduce in this paper a novel non-linear statistical image watermark detector based on undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT)-polar complex exponential transform (PCET) magnitude and the exponentiated Cauchy-Rayleigh distribution. We begin with a detailed study on the robustness and statistical characteristics of local UDWT-PCET magnitudes of natural images. This study reveals the strong robustness and highly non-Gaussian marginal statistics of local UDWT-PCET magnitudes. We also find that, with a small number of parameters, the new exponentiated Cauchy-Rayleigh model can capture accurately the statistical properties of the robust UDWT-PCET magnitudes of the image. Meanwhile, the statistical model parameters can be computed effectively by using the genetic simulated annealing (GSA)-based maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. Based on these findings, we finally develop a new non-linear statistical image watermark detector using the exponentiated Cauchy-Rayleigh PDF and locally most powerful (LMP) decision rule. Also, we use the exponentiated Cauchy-Rayleigh statistical model to derive the closed-form expressions for the watermark detector. Extensive experimental results show the superiority of the proposed blind watermark detector over most of the state-of-the-art methods recently proposed in the literature.

AB Link prediction is an important task in social network analysis, with the goal of evaluating the possibility of forming links between node pairs. In this paper, we introduce compressed sensing technology into the link prediction task and propose a new link prediction method. Here, we transform the link prediction problem into a signal processing process. The idea is to take the links observed in social networks as the encoding result of compressed sensing signals, and then decode the encoded signal using the reconstruction algorithm to obtain more complete network information. We propose a sparse representation algorithm based on K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD), which can integrate network topologies and node attribute information. On this basis, we construct the measurement matrix conforming to the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and further develop the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm to handle the reconstruction issues. Experimental results on ten different types of real social networks show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art link prediction algorithms in terms of both accuracy and universality. In particular, it still performs stably when the network is sparse.

ID VISUAL TRACKING
AB Siamese networks have recently attracted much attention due to balancing accuracy and speed in tracking. However, most Siamese trackers emphasize how to learn target features, ignoring background information. In this paper, a novel Siamese-based method via an adaptive distractor-aware and enhancement confidence evaluator is proposed. First, to make full use of the background information, a distractor model is designed, which is used to select the dominant feature channels of less interference for target representation. Additionally, to enable the target model to work well with challenging scenes, an adaptive weights-aware strategy is proposed, which can adjust the feature channel weights online according to the single-convolutional attention network with L2 loss. In addition, a dynamic template update strategy is proposed to adapt target appearance variations. The strategy evaluates the tracking results via a new correlation peak average energy (CPAE) evaluator, which has more confidence for good templates, guiding the fusion of reliable template samples and further enhancing the adaptability of the template and making the tracker more robust. Experimental results on widely used OTB100, TC-128, UAV123, VOT2016 and VOT2018 benchmarks verified that the proposed tracker achieved outstanding performance compared with state-of-the-art trackers.

AB With the help of neural network-based representation learning, significant progress has been recently made in data-driven online dynamic stability assessment (DSA) of complex electric power systems. However, without sufficient attention to diverse data loss conditions in practice, the existing data-driven DSA solutions' performance could be largely degraded due to practical defective input data. To address this problem, this work develops a robust representation learning approach to enhance DSA performance against multiple input data loss conditions in practice. Specifically, focusing on the short-term voltage stability (SVS) issue, an ensemble representation learning scheme (ERLS) is carefully designed to achieve data loss-tolerant online SVS assessment: 1) based on an efficient data masking technique, various missing data conditions are handled and augmented in a unified manner for lossy learning dataset preparation; 2) the emerging spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) is leveraged to derive multiple diversified base learners with strong capability in SVS feature learning and representation; and 3) with massive SVS scenarios deeply grouped into a number of clusters, these STGCN-enabled base learners are distinctly assembled for each cluster via multilinear regression (MLR) to realize ensemble SVS assessment. Such a divide-and-conquer ensemble strategy results in highly robust SVS assessment performance when faced with various severe data loss conditions. Numerical tests on the benchmark Nordic test system illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Knowledge compliance; neural network (NN) editing; physics-compatible NN
   (PhN)
AB Purely data-driven deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to physical engineering systems can infer relations that violate physics laws, thus leading to unexpected consequences. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-knowledge-enhanced DNN framework called Phy-Taylor, accelerating learning-compliant representations with physics knowledge. The Phy-Taylor framework makes two key contributions; it introduces a new architectural physics-compatible neural network (PhN) and features a novel compliance mechanism, which we call physics-guided neural network (NN) editing. The PhN aims to directly capture nonlinear physical quantities, such as kinetic energy, electrical power, and aerodynamic drag force. To do so, the PhN augments NN layers with two key components: 1) monomials of the Taylor series for capturing physical quantities and 2) a suppressor for mitigating the influence of noise. The NN editing mechanism further modifies network links and activation functions consistently with physics knowledge. As an extension, we also propose a self-correcting Phy-Taylor framework for safety-critical control of autonomous systems, which introduces two additional capabilities: 1) safety relationship learning and 2) automatic output correction when safety violations occur. Through experiments, we show that Phy-Taylor features considerably fewer parameters and a remarkably accelerated training process while offering enhanced model robustness and accuracy.

AB COVID-19 has become a global pandemic that has affected not only the health sector but also economic, social, and psychological well-being. Individuals are using social media platforms to communicate their feelings and sentiments about the pandemic. One of the most debated topics in that regard is the vaccine. People are divided mainly into two groups, pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine. This article aims to explore Arabic Sentiment Analysis for Vaccine-Related COVID-19 Tweets (ASAVACT) to quantify sentiment polarity shared publicly, and it is considered the first and the largest human-annotated dataset in Arabic. The analysis is done using state-of-theart deep learning models that proved superiority in the field of language processing and analysis. The models are the stacked gated recurrent unit (SGRU), the stacked bidirectional gated recurrent unit (SBi-GRU), and the ensemble architecture of SGRU, SBi-GRU, and AraBERT. Additionally, this article presents the largest Arabic Twitter corpus on COVID-19 vaccination, with 32,476 annotated Tweets. The results show that the ensemble model outperformed other singular models with at least 7% accuracy enhancement.

AB With the promotion of energy transformation, the utilization ratio of electrical power is progressively rising. Since electrical power is challenging to store, real-time production and consumption become imperative, imposing significant demands on the dependability and operational efficiency of electrical power apparatus. Suppose the load distribution among multiple transformers within a transformer network exhibits inequality. In such instances, it will amplify the total energy consumption during the voltage conversion process, and local, long-term high-load transformer networks become more susceptible to failures. In this article, we scrutinize the matter of transformer energy utilization in the context of electricity transmission within grid systems. We propose a methodology grounded on genetic algorithms to optimize transformer energy usage by dynamically redistributing loads among diverse transformers based on their operational status monitoring. In our experimentation, we employed three distinct approaches to enhance energy efficiency. The experimental findings evince that this approach facilitates swifter attainment of the optimal power level and diminishes the overall energy consumption during transformer operation. Moreover, it exhibits a heightened responsiveness to fluctuations in power demand from the electrical grid. Experimental results manifest that this technique can truncate monitoring time by 27% and curtail the overall energy consumption of the distribution transformer network by 11.81%. Lastly, we deliberate upon the potential applications of genetic algorithms in the realm of power equipment management and energy optimization issues.

AB Developments in connected and autonomous vehicle technologies provide drivers with many convenience and safety benefits. Unfortunately, as connectivity and complexity within vehicles increase, more entry points or interfaces that may directly or indirectly access in-vehicle networks (IVNs) have been introduced, causing a massive rise in security risks. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a practical method for controlling malicious attacks while guaranteeing real-time communication. Regarding the ever-evolving security attacks on IVNs, researchers have paid more attention to employing deep learning-based techniques to deal with privacy concerns and security threats in the IDS domain. Therefore, this article comprehensively reviews all existing deep IDS approaches on in-vehicle networks and conducts fine-grained classification based on applied deep network architecture. It investigates how deep-learning techniques are utilized to implement different IDS models for better performance and describe their possible contributions and limitations. Further compares and discusses the studied schemes concerning different facets, including input data strategy, benchmark datasets, classification technique, and evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the usage preferences of deep learning in IDS, the influence of the dataset, and the selection of feature segments are discussed to illuminate the main potential properties for designing. Finally, possible research directions for follow-up studies are provided.

AB Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed living standards. However, AI's efforts are being thwarted by concerns about the rise of biases and unfairness. The problem advocates strongly for a strategy for tackling potential biases. This article thoroughly evaluates existing knowledge to enhance fairness management, which will serve as a foundation for creating a unified framework to address any bias and its subsequent mitigation method throughout the AI development pipeline. We map the software development life cycle (SDLC), machine learning life cycle (MLLC) and cross industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) together to have a general understanding of how phases in these development processes are related to each other. The map should benefit researchers from multiple technical backgrounds. Biases are categorised into three distinct classes; pre-existing, technical and emergent bias, and subsequently, three mitigation strategies; conceptual, empirical and technical, along with fairness management approaches; fairness sampling, learning and certification. The recommended practices for debias and overcoming challenges encountered further set directions for successfully establishing a unified framework.

AB Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a privacy-aware alternative to classical cloud-based machine learning. In FL, the sensitive data remains in data silos and only aggregated parameters are exchanged. Hospitals and research institutions which are not willing to share their data can join a federated study without breaching confidentiality. In addition to the extreme sensitivity of biomedical data, the high dimensionality poses a challenge in the context of federated genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this article, we present a federated singular value decomposition algorithm, suitable for the privacy-related and computational requirements of GWAS. Notably, the algorithm has a transmission cost independent of the number of samples and is only weakly dependent on the number of features, because the singular vectors corresponding to the samples are never exchanged and the vectors associated with the features are only transmitted to an aggregator for a fixed number of iterations. Although motivated by GWAS, the algorithm is generically applicable for both horizontally and vertically partitioned data.

AB In recent years, single image super-resolution (SISR) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved satisfactory performance. Nevertheless, the large model scale and the slow inference speed of these methods greatly limit the application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a two-stage three-dimensional attention network (ATTNet) for lightweight image super-resolution. First, we put forward the spatial feature encoder-decoder (SFE-D) with a spatial attention mechanism. Next, the channel transposed attention module (CTAM) with a channel self-attention mechanism is designed. Both the modules are used for fine feature extraction in the low-resolution stage. Finally, the content-based pixel recombination module (CPRM) is proposed to reconstruct the detailed content with a joint attention mechanism in the high-resolution stage. According to our experimental results, significant performance in terms of the quantitative metrics and the subjective visual quality can be achieved on average compared with the state-of-the-art lightweight SISR algorithms.

AB The function of accessibility guide signs is to convey information to users. The key to designing accessibility guide signs is to improve the efficiency with which they convey information. In this paper, 16 subjects were recruited to study their attentional status when faced with different forms of accessibility sign design by setting up two sets of comparison tests. The subjects watched six videos containing different sign designs with different lighting effects to compare their attention to the different sign designs. We collected the participants' eye-movement, EEG, and HRV data during the experiment, and the PSSUQ questionnaire was administered. The data showed that subjects could quickly attend to the processed signs but did not show significant differences in brain responses. Among the study variables, there were significant differences in the effects of different light frequencies on subjects' attention. Study results suggest that designers can consider the existing sign designs for public places and add richer visual information to the designs, thus improving the efficiency of information transmission.

DE Explainable neural networks; Relational features; Inductive logic

ID FEATURE CONSTRUCTION; NETWORKS; LOGIC
AB Three key strengths of relational machine learning programs like those developed in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are: (1) The use of an expressive subset of first-order logic that allows models that capture complex relationships amongst data instances; (2) The use of domain-specific relations to guide the construction of models; and (3) The models constructed are human-readable, which is often one step closer to being human-understandable. The price for these advantages is that ILP-like methods have not been able to capitalise fully on the rapid hardware, software and algorithmic developments fuelling current developments in deep neural networks. In this paper, we treat relational features as functions and use the notion of generalised composition of functions to derive complex functions from simpler ones. Motivated by the work of McCreath and Sharma, we formulate the notion of a set of M-simple features in a mode language M and identify two composition operators (rho(1) and rho(2)) from which all possible complex features can be derived. We use these results to implement a form of "explainable neural network" called Compositional Relational Machines, or CRMs. CRMs are labelled directed-acyclic graphs. The vertex-label for any vertex j in the CRM contains a feature-function f(j) and an continuous activation function g(j). If j is a "non-input" vertex, then f(j) is the composition of features associated with vertices in the direct predecessors of j. Our focus is on CRMs in which input vertices (those without any direct predecessors) all have M-simple features in their vertex-labels. We provide a randomised procedure for constructing the structure of such CRMs, and a procedure for estimating the parameters (the w(ij)'s) using back-propagation and stochastic gradient descent. Using a notion of explanations based on the compositional structure of features in a CRM, we provide empirical evidence on synthetic data of the ability to identify appropriate explanations; and demonstrate the use of CRMs as 'explanation machines' for black-box models that do not provide explanations for their predictions.

AB The microservice architecture breaks through the traditional cluster architecture mode based on virtual machines and uses containers as carriers to interact through lightweight communication mechanisms to reduce system coupling and provide more flexible system service support. With the expansion of the system scale, a large number of system logs with complex structures and chaotic relationships are generated. How to accurately analyze the system logs and make efficient fault prediction is particularly important for building a safe and reliable system. By studying neural network technology, this paper proposes an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM). Combined with the dual channel convolutional neural network model (DCNN), it uses the attention mechanism to explore the differences between dimensional features, realizes multi-dimensional feature fusion, and establishes a BiLSTM-DCNN deep learning model that integrates the attention mechanism. From the perspective of social network analysis, a data preprocessing method is proposed to process fault redundant data and improve the accuracy of fault prediction under Microservices. Compare BiLSTM-DCNN with the mainstream system log analysis machine learning models SVM, CNN and Bi-LSTM, and explore the advantages of BiLSTM-DCNN in processing microservice system log text. The model is applied to simulation data and HDFS data set for experimental comparison, which proves the good generalization ability and universality of BiLSTM-DCNN.

AB This manuscript proposes the concept of Schweizer-Sklar operational laws under the consideration of the complex interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (CIVIF) set theory, where the Schweizer-Sklar norms are the essential and valuable modification of many norms, such as algebraic, Hamacher, and Lukasiewicz norms. Moreover, keeping the dominancy of the presented laws, we derive the concept of CIVIF Schweizer-Sklar power averaging (CIVIFSSPA), CIVIF Schweizer-Sklar power ordered averaging (CIVIFSSPOA), CIVIF Schweizer-Sklar power geometric (CIVIFSSPG), and CIVIF Schweizer-Sklar power ordered geometric (CIVIFSSPOG) operators, which are the combination of the three different structures for evaluating three different problems. Further, some reliable and feasible properties and results for derived work are also invented. Additionally, we also illustrate an application, called multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) scenario for evaluating some real-world problems with the help of discovered operators for showing the reliability and stability of the evaluated operators. Finally, we compare our mentioned operators with various prevailing operators for enhancing the worth and stability of the evaluated approaches.

AB The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is widely recognized for its efficacy in solving optimization problems, although it encounters challenges in striking a balance between exploration and exploitation. To improve these limitations, a novel model, termed the novel sine cosine algorithm (nSCA), is introduced. In this advanced model, the roulette wheel selection (RWS) mechanism and opposition-based learning (OBL) techniques are integrated to augment its global optimization capabilities. A meticulous evaluation of nSCA performance has been carried out in comparison with state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, including multi-verse optimizer (MVO), salp swarm algorithm (SSA), moth-flame optimization (MFO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), in addition to the original SCA. This comparative analysis was conducted across a wide array of 23 classical test functions and 29 CEC2017 benchmark functions, thereby facilitating a comprehensive assessment. Further validation of nSCA utility has been achieved through its deployment in five distinct engineering optimization case studies. Its effectiveness and relevance in addressing real-world optimization issues have thus been emphasized. Across all conducted tests and practical applications, nSCA was found to outperform its competitors consistently, furnishing more effective solutions to both theoretical and applied optimization problems.

AB This paper proposes a novel surrogate ensemble-assisted hyper-heuristic algorithm (SEA-HHA) to solve expensive optimization problems (EOPs). A representative HHA consists of two parts: the low-level and the high-level components. In the low-level component, we regard the surrogate-assisted technique as a type of search strategy and design the four search strategy archives: exploration strategy archive, exploitation strategy archive, surrogate-assisted estimation archive, and mutation strategy archive as low-level heuristics (LLHs), each archive contains one or more search strategies. Once the surrogate-assisted estimation archive is activated to generate the offspring individual, SEA-HHA first selects the dataset for model construction from three principles: All Data, Recent Data, and Neighbor, which correspond to the global and the local surrogate model, respectively. Then, the dataset is randomly divided into training and validation data, and the most accurate model built by polynomial regression (PR), support vector regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) cooperates with the infill sampling criterion is employed for solution estimation. In the high-level component, we design a random selection function based on the pre-defined probabilities to manipulate a set of LLHs. In numerical experiments, we compare SEA-HHA with six optimization techniques on 5-D, 10-D, and 30-D CEC2013 benchmark functions and three engineering optimization problems with only 1000 fitness evaluation times (FEs). The experimental and statistical results show that our proposed SEA-HHA has broad prospects for dealing with EOPs.

AB Precise markings for drilling and assembly are crucial, laborious construction tasks. Aerial robots with suitable end-effectors are capable of markings at the millimeter scale. However, so far, they have only been demonstrated under laboratory conditions where rigid state estimation and navigation assumptions do not impede robustness and accuracy. This paper presents a complete aerial layouting system capable of precise markings on-site under realistic conditions. We use a compliant actuated end-effector on an omnidirectional flying base. Combining a two-stage factor-graph state estimator with a Riemannian Motion Policy-based navigation stack, we avoid the need for a globally consistent state estimate and increase robustness. The policy-based navigation is structured into individual behaviors in different state spaces. Through a comprehensive study, we show that the system creates highly precise markings at a relative precision of 1.5 mm and a global accuracy of 5-6 mm and discuss the results in the context of future construction robotics.

AB Private equity investment funds targeted increase in NEEQ has become a new strategy for PE investment. However, the currently adopted Logit regression and one-factor ANOVA models are not suitable for analyzing nonlinear investment activities, and the investment appraisal does not work well. In this paper, all NEEQ companies that implemented private placement in 2017 are used as the study sample. This paper also empirically analyzes the current situation of domestic private equity investment funds based on BP and Hopfield neural network models, then the results of the two models are compared. It is concluded that the accuracy of the BP neural network model can be more than 90%. So, the BP neural network can be used as the optimal model of private equity investment funds investment strategy in NEEQ.

ID VULNERABILITIES
AB Search-based Test Case Generation (TCG) for web applications suffers from unstable performance and suboptimal test suite problems due to diversity loss. However, previous diversity metrics mainly only focus on client-side models or server-side code, which are prone to low robustness and poor generalization in practical applications. We propose a diversity-driven TCG method DTester, which can maximize behavior exploration and minimize the test suite size while covering more server-side vulnerable paths. Three diversity metrics (i.e. phenotypic coupling, intent coupling and competitiveness) are proposed to measure the underlying relationship between test cases from user behavior, code logic and test execution history. Moreover, a 3-dimensional weight graph is designed to model association among metrics, which provides fine-grained guidance for the genetic algorithm to generate diverse test cases from the client-side behavior model. Our empirical evaluation on five web applications shows that DTester can efficiently and robustly generate better test suites than the state-of-the-art TCG method. The maximum improvement is 85%, 60%, 716% and 88% in efficiency, test suite size, diversity and robustness.

AB Effective control of the tower crane system (TCS) is crucial for the safe and quick transport of goods from one point to another in industries and construction sites. However, the existing literature either depends on the dynamic model of the system, which is prone to errors and assumptions, or requires the feedback of the states to be controlled, which can be costly and or complex. In particular, the TCS has many states and is highly nonlinear. Thus, a non-model-based control approach that depends on minimal feedback sensors is needed. The primary contribution of this work is that the potential hybrid configurations of the input shaping control (ISC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC) were proposed and investigated. The study provides the best hybrid configuration of the ISC and FLC (non-model-based controllers) for optimal positioning and anti-swing control of the TCS. Three configurations of the ISC + FLC, namely shaper as reference input (SARI), shaper as input to the FLC (SAI2F), and shaper as input to the plant (SAI2P) were investigated to assess the optimal hybrid configuration of the ISC + FLC. The results demonstrated that the hybrid ISC + FLC scheme had improved the response of ISC by at least 150% and enhanced the oscillation reduction of FLC by 72%. Finally, these analyses showed that the ISC + FLC could achieve reasonable control of the tower crane by only considering the output of one state (position). This makes the control scheme cheaper and reduces the complexity and computational time compared to other full-state feedback controllers.

AB By combining blockchain technology (BT) and reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed work addresses the difficulties associated with vaccine recommendations. The need for individualized recommendations is obvious as vaccine schedules become more complicated and there are more vaccines available. The proposed work presents a novel approach that combines the adaptability of RL with the security, privacy, and transparency of BT. Layers for data processing, application, consensus, and smart contracts are included in the system architecture. It provides user-managed secure access, individualized vaccine recommendations, and decentralized data storage. The system aims to improve public health outcomes by using smart contracts to automate procedures and RL to improve recommendations. Using 10-fold cross-validation on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) dataset, the experimental study verifies the performance of the system. The study focuses on metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-measure when contrasting the proposed model with current solutions. The ability of proposed model to offer precise and well-informed vaccine recommendations is demonstrated by its consistent outperformance of competitors in accuracy and sensitivity.

AB Crowd counting (CC) and density estimation are crucial for ensuring public safety and security in surveillance videos with large audiences. As computer vision-based scene interpretation advances, automatic analysis of crowd situations is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, existing crowd analysis algorithms may not accurately interpret the video footage. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach called SMOHDL-CCA. This approach combines a Slime Mold Optimization algorithm with a Hybrid Deep Learning Enabled CC Approach. Our system uses the SMO algorithm with an optimized neural network search network (NASNet) model as the front-end to take advantage of transfer learning and flexible characteristics. The back-end model employs Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks, and the hyperparameter tuning process is done using the Chicken Swarm Optimization algorithm. Given a crowded video input frame, our SMOHDL-CCA model estimates the density map of the image. Each pixel value indicates the crowd density at the corresponding location in the picture. The final crowd count is obtained by summing all the values in the density map. We evaluated our proposed approach using three standard datasets. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art combining the proposed SMOHDL-CCA model achieves comparable performance such as improved precision is 96.97%, recall is 96.94%, and F1 score is 96.61%, reduced mean squared error of 61.15 values for the NWPU-crowd, UCF_QNRF, and World Expo datasets.

AB Forever and a day, breast cancer has caused significant negative impacts on the quality of lives of number of women, more often than not turning into a fatal disease. The growth in the number of such cases has constantly been a major concern for the community as well as medical experts. To prevent irreversible damages caused by the disease, early identification of breast cancer is essential. Various researches and techniques have been devised in the past as an attempt to achieve this task with appreciable accuracy. As an advancement to these pre-existing algorithms and methods, we have devised a model by exploiting the techniques of nature-inspired metaheuristics in order to efficiently detect breast cancer at an early stage while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model, namely "hybrid artificial bee colony and black hole with genetic operators (GBHABC)", for the early detection of breast cancer. In the proposed model, we employed a support vector machine (SVM) ensemble technique, optimized using the proposed GBHABC model. This model combines the techniques of two major algorithms, namely artificial bee colony (ABC) and black hole (BH), guided through crossover and mutation genetic operators. Datasets from the well-known UCI breast cancer repository have been used to train the models and evaluate test result. For a fair and accurate evaluation of the model, a number of metrics have been examined including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score and precision. An impeccable accuracy of 99.42% was obtained on the UCI dataset, clearly outperforming any literature in the same field.

AB Feature selection of the neighborhood rough set is an important step in preprocessing the data and improving classification performance. Neighborhood granules form the basis for neighborhood rough set learning and reasoning, but granules typically have overlap, which will cause sample classification uncertainty or repeatability. For this reason, a new notion of neighborhood equivalence relation is used in this paper. Neighborhood equivalence granules solve the above problems, those granules are usually finer than that of the classical neighborhood rough set. In this paper, the neighborhood relation in traditional neighborhood rough set is replaced by neighborhood equivalence relation. Based on neighborhood equivalence relation, a Neighborhood rough set Model based on neighborhood Equivalence Relation (NMER) is proposed. We also introduce the properties of NMER and explain the significance of features. Based on the proposed NMER, a feature selection algorithm is also designed. The reduction results on twelve datasets show that the proposed feature selection algorithm can select main and useful features, confirming the effectiveness of the algorithm.

TI Language-Aware Soft Prompting: Text-to-Text Optimization for Few- and
   Zero-Shot Adaptation of V &L Models
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Multimodal learning; Few-shot recognition; Zero-shot recognition;
   Prompting; Domain generalization
AB Soft prompt learning has emerged as a promising direction for adapting V &L models to a downstream task using a few training examples. However, current methods significantly overfit the training data suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain. In addition, all prior methods operate exclusively under the assumption that both vision and language data is present. To this end, we make the following 5 contributions: (1) To alleviate base class overfitting, we propose a novel Language-Aware Soft Prompting (LASP) learning method by means of a text-to-text cross-entropy loss that maximizes the probability of the learned prompts to be correctly classified with respect to pre-defined hand-crafted textual prompts. (2) To increase the representation capacity of the prompts, we also propose grouped LASP where each group of prompts is optimized with respect to a separate subset of textual prompts. (3) Moreover, we identify a visual-language misalignment introduced by prompt learning and LASP, and more importantly, propose a re-calibration mechanism to address it. (4) Importantly, we show that LASP is inherently amenable to including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned prompts. Expanding for the first time the setting to language-only adaptation, (5) we present a novel zero-shot variant of LASP where no visual samples at all are available for the downstream task. Through evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a) significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches and surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for 8 out of 11 test datasets. Finally, (c) we show that our zero-shot variant improves upon CLIP without requiring any extra data. Code will be made available.

TI FlowNAS: Neural Architecture Search for Optical Flow Estimation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Optical flow estimation; Neural architecture search; Knowledge
   distillation
AB Recent optical flow estimators usually employ deep models designed for image classification as the encoders for feature extraction and matching. However, those encoders developed for image classification may be sub-optimal for flow estimation. In contrast, the decoder design of optical flow estimators often requires meticulous design for flow estimation. The disconnect between the encoder and decoder could negatively affect optical flow estimation. To address this issue, we propose a neural architecture search method, FlowNAS, to automatically find the more suitable and stronger encoder architecture for existing flow decoders. We first design a suitable search space, including various convolutional operators, and construct a weight-sharing super-network for efficiently evaluating the candidate architectures. To better train the super-network, we present a Feature Alignment Distillation module that utilizes a well-trained flow estimator to guide the training of the super-network. Finally, a resource-constrained evolutionary algorithm is exploited to determine an optimal architecture (i.e., sub-network). Experimental results show that FlowNAS can be easily incorporated into existing flow estimators and achieves state-of-the-art performance with the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, the encoder architecture discovered by FlowNAS with the weights inherited from the super-network achieves 4.67% F1-all error on KITTI, an 8.4% reduction of RAFT baseline, surpassing state-of-the-art handcrafted GMA and AGFlow models, while reducing the model complexity and latency. The source code and trained models will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/FlowNAS.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Embodied visual navigation; Symmetry; Generalization; Equivariance;
   Invariance
AB The existing methods for addressing visual navigation employ deep reinforcement learning as the standard tool for the task. However, they tend to be vulnerable to statistical shifts between the training and test data, resulting in poor generalization over novel environments that are out-of-distribution from the training data. In this study, we attempt to improve the generalization ability by utilizing the inductive biases available for the task. Employing the active neural SLAM that learns policies with the advantage actor-critic method as the base framework, we first point out that the mappings represented by the actor and the critic should satisfy specific symmetries. We then propose a network design for the actor and the critic to inherently attain these symmetries. Specifically, we use G-convolution instead of the standard convolution and insert the semi-global polar pooling layer, which we newly design in this study, in the last section of the critic network. Our method can be integrated into existing methods that utilize intermediate goals and 2D occupancy maps. Experimental results show that our method improves generalization ability by a good margin over visual exploration and object goal navigation, which are two main embodied visual navigation tasks.

AB Hand gesture recognition plays an important role in developing effective human-machine interfaces (HMIs) that enable direct communication between humans and machines. But in real-time scenarios, it is difficult to identify the correct hand gesture to control an application while moving the hands. To address this issue, in this work, a low-cost hand gesture recognition system based human-computer interface (HCI) is presented in real-time scenarios. The system consists of six stages: (1) hand detection, (2) gesture segmentation, (3) feature extraction and gesture classification using five pre-trained convolutional neural network models (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT), (4) building an interactive human-machine interface (HMI), (5) development of a gesture-controlled virtual mouse, (6) smoothing of virtual mouse pointer using of Kalman filter. In our work, five pre-trained CNN models (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, ResNet101, and Inception-V1) and ViT have been employed to classify hand gesture images. Two multi-class datasets (one public and one custom) have been used to validate the models. Considering the model's performances, it is observed that Inception-V1 has significantly shown a better classification performance compared to the other four CNN models and ViT in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values. We have also expanded this system to control some multimedia applications (such as VLC player, audio player, playing 2D Super-Mario-Bros game, etc.) with different customized gesture commands in real-time scenarios. The average speed of this system has reached 25 fps (frames per second), which meets the requirements for the real-time scenario. Performance of the proposed gesture control system obtained the average response time in milisecond for each control which makes it suitable for real-time. This model (prototype) will benefit physically disabled people interacting with desktops.

AB Data and its valuation have gained vital significance in academia and enterprises, coinciding with diverse data valuation approaches encompassing various layers, dimensions, and characteristics. This paper assesses data value determination through a business capability lens based on the TOGAF standard. The paper encompasses (a) constructing a Data Valuation Business Capability (DVBC) taxonomy and (b) validating the taxonomy using two existing data valuation concepts from academia. The methodology involves information systems taxonomy development techniques backed by a previously conducted systematic literature review of 64 articles. The resultant taxonomy comprises four business capability layers, nine dimensions, and 36 characteristics. These layers and dimensions offer business, technology, and organizational perspectives, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of data valuation alongside an enterprise architecture. Characteristics within these layers and dimensions are either exclusive or non-exclusive based on their contents. The compiled findings meet both objective and subjective quality criteria. The implications of the DVBC are multifaceted, influencing scholars and professionals alike. Scholars gain a cohesive tool enhancing transparency in the extensively debated data value domain, fostering linkages among information systems, enterprise architecture management, and data management. This empowers the progress in developing comprehensive data valuation concepts. Additionally, professionals may employ the DVBC taxonomy as a lighthouse and guiding tool, fostering internal dialog on data valuation. This entails elevating data valuation to a pivotal business capability, necessitating collaborative, regular assessment, and enhancement involving business and technological stakeholders. By adopting this taxonomy, the challenge of consistently determining data value can be effectively addressed in both academia and enterprises.

ID GENERATION; SYSTEM; TASK
AB This paper proposes an approach to automate chemistry experiments using robots by translating natural language instructions into robot-executable plans, using large language models together with task and motion planning. Adding natural language interfaces to autonomous chemistry experiment systems lowers the barrier to using complicated robotics systems and increases utility for non-expert users, but translating natural language experiment descriptions from users into low-level robotics languages is nontrivial. Furthermore, while recent advances have used large language models to generate task plans, reliably executing those plans in the real world by an embodied agent remains challenging. To enable autonomous chemistry experiments and alleviate the workload of chemists, robots must interpret natural language commands, perceive the workspace, autonomously plan multi-step actions and motions, consider safety precautions, and interact with various laboratory equipment. Our approach, CLAIRify, combines automatic iterative prompting with program verification to ensure syntactically valid programs in a data-scarce domain-specific language that incorporates environmental constraints. The generated plan is executed through solving a constrained task and motion planning problem using PDDLStream solvers to prevent spillages of liquids as well as collisions in chemistry labs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning chemistry experiments, with plans successfully executed on a real robot using a repertoire of robot skills and lab tools. Specifically, we showcase the utility of our framework in pouring skills for various materials and two fundamental chemical experiments for materials synthesis: solubility and recrystallization. Further details about CLAIRify can be found at https://ac-rad.github.io/clairify/.

AB This paper presents federated Learning (FL), which is based on wearable devices, and applies the actual leg agility data that has been collected from people living with Parkinson's disease (PD) to the model. Studies have shown that the implementation of FL can effectively protect the data privacy of PD patients. The classification accuracy of leg agility data is reduced by 2.72% when compared to the conventional method of summarizing all the data. However, it is higher than the model accuracy of each data owner, having increased by 22.68%. Secondly, during the communication process, the upload or download of the model parameters of each terminal node is interrupted for N times at the same time, and it is found that interrupting the upload of parameters reduces the accuracy of the central model. The impact of interrupting the download parameters on the central model is negligible. Then, the communication process of the terminal nodes with different data amounts was interrupted respectively, and it was found that the accuracy of the central model was basically not affected. Finally, noise is introduced to the various parameters in the communication process. The accuracy of the central model begins to gradually deteriorate as soon as the noise intensity reaches 0.012 or higher.

AB The goal of vehicle re-identification is to identify the same vehicle from multiple cameras, which is a challenging task. There are many solutions to this problem, among which the self-attention mechanism is very popular. It can capture the long-range dependence in an image, thereby suppressing the irrelevant features. Most of the existing designs are based on isolated pairwise query-key interactions to refine a node. They implicitly mine attention patterns without explicitly modeling node weights. In this paper, we propose a global relational attention mechanism, which makes full use of the global dependence of a node to learn and infer its weight value. Global dependence can measure the importance of nodes more robustly and efficiently. To capture more discriminative features, we propose a maximum suppression constraint to adaptively adjust weight values to expand the range of attention. In addition, we design a pair of effective attention modules based on the proposed attention mechanism, that focus on mining the discriminative features related to vehicle identities from the spatial and channel dimensions. We conduct a large number of experiments on the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Similar case analysis (SCA) is an essential topic in legal artificial intelligence, serving as a reference for legal professionals. Most existing works treat SCA as a traditional text classification task and ignore some important legal elements that affect the verdict and case similarity, like legal events, and thus are easily misled by semantic structure. To address this issue, we propose a Legal Event-Context Model named LECM to improve the accuracy and interpretability of SCA based on Chinese legal corpus. The event-context integration mechanism, which is an essential component of the LECM, is proposed to integrate the legal event and context information based on the attention mechanism, enabling legal events to be associated with their corresponding relevant contexts. We introduce an event detection module to obtain the legal event information, which is pre-trained on a legal event detection dataset to avoid labeling events manually. We conduct extensive experiments on two SCA tasks, i.e., similar case matching (SCM) and similar case retrieval (SCR). Compared with baseline models, LECM is validated by about 13% and 11% average improvement in terms of mean average precision and accuracy respectively, for SCR and SCM tasks. These results indicate that LECM effectively utilizes event-context knowledge to enhance SCA performance and its potential application in various legal document analysis tasks.

AB Springback is one of the major shape defects in roll forming. It is difficult to predict springback accurately and efficiently because the process involves complicated deformation. In this paper, a high accuracy Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm based on the Simulated Annealing Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (SAPSO) is proposed to predict springback. Firstly, simulations of the forming process of V-channel profile are carried out to investigate the springback at different fillet radii, yield strengths, uphill volumes and roll span spaces. Then with the data obtained, the accuracy of SAPSO-SVR, SVR, and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) prediction models was tested. The experimental results show that SAPSO-SVR has the highest prediction accuracy, and its average absolute error is about 0.11 circle\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>\circ $$\end{document}, which is 38.7% less than BPNN, and 61.8% less than SVR. Furthermore, in order to explore the applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in investigating forming mechanisms, the relationship between forming parameters and springback was elucidated based on the prediction model. It is found that the roll span space had a small impact on springback, but a larger roll span space would reduce the impact of the uphill volume on springback. And applying an uphill volume of -\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$-\,$$\end{document}10 mm will minimize the variation of longitudinal strain in the cross section, thereby reducing the trend of flange inward shrinkage and leading to an increase in springback. The above conclusions are mutually verified with traditional theoretical research. This paper establishes a high accuracy prediction model and explores the springback mechanism, which can provide important theoretical references for future research on intelligent roll forming.

AB Given the increasing severity of ecological issues, sustainable development and green manufacturing have emerged as crucial areas of research and practice. The continuous growth of the globalizing economy has led to the prevalence of distributed manufacturing systems. Distributed flow-shop scheduling problem (DFSP) is a complex NP-hard problem that involves two highly coupled sub-problems: job allocating for factories and job sequencing within factories. This paper proposes an efficient Q-learning-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (QL-MoPSO) to address the DFSP, with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has been enhanced by dividing particles into three subgroups, enabling faster convergence to three distinct areas of the Pareto Front (PF). Q-learning guides variable neighborhood search (VNS) as a local search strategy, balancing exploration and exploitation capabilities. To make the algorithm more reasonable and efficient for solving DFSP, multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MoPSO) uses the exchange sequence to update the job sequence vector, crossover and mutation to update the factory assignment vector. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm accelerates convergence and ensures good distribution performance and diversity, outperforming traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

AB With a goal of timely and adaptively exploiting the inconsistency inherited in the monitored samples of current interest, a novel dynamic process monitoring method based on just-in-time latent autoregressive residual generation (JITLAR2G) model is proposed. Different from the mainstream dynamic modeling and monitoring methods which usually train a signature generating mechanism and then repeatedly apply it for online monitored samples, the proposed JITLAR2G-based approach provides a JITLAR2G model for the online monitored samples after data augmentation, so that the corresponding inconsistency within the given consecutive samples could be timely and adaptively uncovered. Instead of expressing the time-serial relationship that generally accepted by the normal samples in the given dataset, solving the objective function designed for JITLAR2G in a just-in-time manner can adaptively and correspondingly seek but only one projecting vector as well as coefficient vector to generate residual, which points to the potential inconsistency inherited in the monitored samples, for the sole purpose of fault detection. As demonstrated through comparisons, the proposed JITLAR2G model can consistently guarantee its effectiveness, in terms of reducing both false alarm rate and missed alarm rate, for dynamic process monitoring, the salient performance achieved by the proposed JITLAR2G-based method in contrast to the counterparts can be always confirmed.

AB The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known optimisation problem that has been widely studied over the last century. As a result, a variety of exact and approximate algorithms have been proposed in the literature. When it comes to solving large instances in real-time, greedy algorithms guided by priority rules represent the most common approach, being the nearest neighbour (NN) heuristic one of the most popular rules. NN is quite general but it is too simple and so it may not be the best choice in some cases. Alternatively, we may design more sophisticated heuristics considering the particular features of families of instances. To do that, we have to consider problem attributes other than the proximity of the next city to build priority rules. However, this process may not be easy for humans and so it is often addressed by some learning procedure. In this regard, hyper-heuristics as Genetic Programming (GP) stands as one of the most popular approaches. Furthermore, a single heuristic, even being good in average, may not be good for a number of instances of a given set. For this reason, the use of ensembles of heuristics is often a good alternative, which raises the problem of building ensembles from a given set of heuristic rules. In this paper, we study the application of two kinds of ensembles to the TSP. Given a set of TSP instances having similar characteristics, we firstly exploit a GP to build a set of heuristics involving a number of problem attributes, and then we build ensembles combining these heuristics by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The experimental study provided valuable insights into the construction and utilisation of single rules and ensembles. It clearly demonstrated that the performance of ensembles justifies the time invested when compared to using individual heuristics.

AB Improving the quality of education through effective teaching evaluation is crucial. A scientific and rational assessment system for physical education is important. The assessment of teaching is a complex and dynamic process, but utilizing the cutting-edge technology of fuzzy neural networks can help navigate this complexity. This study aimed to improve the assessment of physical education classes. The first step towards creating a multi-index evaluation system for college physical education instructors' performance is to use the analytical hierarchy technique. This technique evaluates the instructor's teaching content, method, attitude, and influence. In this study, a system was developed for physical education using a fuzzy neural network model to evaluate faculty members in college-level physical education workshops. The input for the fuzzy neural network model is the assessment evaluation, and its output is a vector that indicates the quality of the college physical education received by the student, classified as great, good, average, or bad. Compared to other approaches for evaluating the quality of physical education courses in higher education, the fuzzy neural network model has shown higher accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score. After implementing the proposed methods for imparting physical education, there was a significant improvement in accuracy (95%), specificity (94%), sensitivity (92%), and F1 score (93%). The proposed method is more efficient than the traditional approaches.

AB Uncertain and fuzzy linguistic variables are oftenly used to express evaluation information of experts in group decision making approaches. To recognize the limits of human cognition and subjectivity of human evaluations, several fuzzy numbers based approaches have been studied to select remanufacturing alternatives in decision making processes, however these methods have certain deficiencies such as lacking manipulation tools of diverse information, additional adjustments and suppositions, ignoring randomness in experts' judgements and lack of mechanism tools to evaluate interrelationship among remanufacturing criteria. The accurate analysis of engineering characteristics in remanufacturing phase is vital for worn and aged products as it can effectively determine the orientation of subsequent remanufacturing practice strategies. In this research paper, a novel remanufacturing machine tool assessment approach is proposed by integrating dual interval rough integrated cloud model with complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method. The dual interval rough integrated cloud COPRAS method is constructed using hybrid weighting scheme by computing subjective and objective weights with an effective new variance formula for interval clouds. The alternatives are ranked based on maximizing and minimizing indices, and relative significant coefficients. Finally, the proposed hybrid COPRAS method is illustrated with an example of remanufacturing of machine tool models for gear hobbing machines, machining centers and lathe. An improved modified version of dual interval rough integrated TOPSIS method is also proposed and compared with hybrid COPRAS method. The cost factor of remanufacturing criteria is added in the normalization method to get more appropriate and reliable results. The ranking results are analyzed for both considering and ignoring the cost criteria. The efficacy out-performance of proposed methods is compared with existing approaches based on fuzzy numbers, rough numbers and their hybrid models.

AB The proliferation of legal documents in various formats and their dispersion across multiple courts present a significant challenge for users seeking precise matches to their information requirements. Despite notable advancements in legal information retrieval systems, research into legal recommender systems remains limited. A plausible factor contributing to this scarcity could be the absence of extensive publicly accessible datasets or benchmarks. While a few studies have emerged in this field, a comprehensive analysis of the distinct attributes of legal data that influence the design of effective legal recommenders is notably absent in the current literature. This paper addresses this gap by initially amassing a comprehensive session-based dataset from Jusbrasil, one of Brazil's largest online legal platforms. Subsequently, we scrutinize and discourse key facets of legal session-based recommendation data, including session duration, types of recommendable legal artifacts, coverage, and popularity. Furthermore, we introduce the first session-based recommendation benchmark tailored to the legal domain, shedding light on the performance and constraints of several renowned session-based recommendation approaches. These evaluations are based on real-world data sourced from Jusbrasil.

AB Emotional recognition in conversations (ERC) is increasingly being applied in various IoT devices. Deep learning-based multimodal ERC has achieved great success by leveraging diverse and complementary modalities. Although most existing methods try to adopt attention mechanisms to fuse different information, these methods ignore the complementarity between modalities. To this end, the joint cross-attention model is introduced to alleviate this issue. However, multi-scale feature information on different modalities is not utilized. Moreover, the context relationship plays an important role in feature extraction in the expression recognition task. In this paper, we propose a novel joint hierarchical graph convolution network (JHGCN) which exploits different layer features and context relationships for facial expression recognition based on audio-visual (A-V) information. Specifically, we adopt different deep networks to extract features from different modalities individually. For V modality, we construct V graph data based on patch embeddings which are extracted from the transformer encoder. Moreover, we embed the graph convolution which can leverage the intra-modality relationships with the transformer encoder. Then, the deep feature from different layers is fed to the hierarchical fusion module to enhance feature representation. At last, we use the joint cross-attention mechanism to exploit the complementary inter-modality relationships. To validate the proposed model, we have conducted various experiments on the AffWild2 and CMU-MOSI datasets. All results confirm that our proposed model achieves highly promising performance compared to the joint cross-attention model and other methods.

AB There are certain challenges in person re-identification tasks owing to changes in illumination, color, scale, viewpoint, and occlusion. Data augmentation and multi-branch network have been proven to be effective methods for improving the performance of person re-identification. However, current methods focus on general data augmentation and feature extraction and neglect valuable feature representation and scene characteristics. In addition, the measurements do not pertain to scenes with changing viewpoints that lack spatial information. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a person re-identification method with Mahalanobis TRM Triplet in multi-branch network to solve the above problems. First, by constructing a multi-branch network, local features and global features can be extracted and learned and more efficient fine-grained features can be extracted. Second, in order to improve the robustness of the model under a wide range of conditions, we also construct an embedded joint data augmentation module to refresh the input dataset that can handle diverse situations in which a novel random mosaic erasing method is proposed. Finally, a Mahalanobis-based Triplet loss with a Transformation Relation Matrix is proposed to encode the changing factors into the learning process and enhance the model robustness. We evaluate our methods with current mainstream benchmarks Market1501, DukeMTMCreID, and MSMT17 and achieve significant performance in terms of mAP and CMC.

AB The accurate segmentation of breast tumours is important for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. When using the classic U-Net, Attention-UNet, and UNet++ to segment the tumour, there are problems of oversegmentation, incorrect segmentation, and poor edge continuity. In this paper, an effective tumour segmentation method, EfficientUNet, is proposed. EfficientUNet adopts a step-by-step enhancement method, combining ResNet18, a channel attention mechanism and deep supervision. ResNet18, as the encoder of the whole network, solves the problem of gradient disappearanceand improves the feature extraction ability of the model. The channel attention module makes the model more accurate in tumour edge processing. The deep supervision technology accelerates the model training and provides the convergence direction for the model. In addition, it is found that when adjusting the size of the image, the method of image filling before clipping (or zooming) is more conducive to model learning than the direct interpolation method. And a comparative experiment wasperformed on dataset B. Compared to U-Net, Attention-UNet and UNet++, EfficientUNet has the highest performance. Finally, the ablation experiment also indicated the effectiveness of each module in EfficientUNet.

AB The relationship between the tourism economy and the ecological environment has always been a hot issue in tourism research today. Because increasing tourism in rural regions frequently endangers the environment and rural culture, this study uses the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the best policy balance between environmental preservation and tourism infrastructure. First, this research describes the methods used to incorporate a decision-making framework based on MDP into rural ecotourism, with a particular emphasis on the Zibo region of China. To navigate this complex game interplay, we proposed a Markov Decision Process MDP model bearing three pivotal states for this problem. These states are the Economic State, Ecological State, and Environment State. In this model, we also identified three distinct actions. Each action carries its significance. These actions include Promoting Tourism, Environment Protection, and Infrastructural Investment. We relied on data spanning a decade in Zibo of China to calculate the likelihood and real-world dynamic probability. The optimum policy is driven after the MDP simulation. Second, to validate the optimum policy, the policies were also iterated. In the last phase, the Sequential Markov Decision Process is simulated. This simulation not only shows the current state and policy for the area but also predicts the future strategies and policies for Tourism Economy and Rural Environment protection. The experimental results show that the model achieved the best policy and strategy. The experimental results show that the model successfully achieved the best policy and strategy. After 10,000 iterations, the score of gamma = 0.9 is achieved, and the iteration of policies provides a better insight into the chosen strategy. The results are optimistic, with our method achieving an accuracy of 85%, recall of 88%, precision of 82%, F1-Score of 85%, sensitivity of 88%, and consistency of 90%. Our approach outshines the competition when assessing performance in specific geographic areas, achieving the highest accuracy in Area A (92%) and Area C (94%). These findings demonstrate the adaptability and the effectiveness of our approach in handling various ecological contexts.

AB This paper addresses the problem of locating vehicle-identification sensors along the arcs of the transportation network. The aim is to estimate the traffic volumes for a given set of routes under the assumption that the available sensors are insufficient to uniquely identify all route flows. We present a novel mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to determine the sensor locations so that in the system of linear equations solved in the path reconstruction phase, those routes whose volume cannot be uniquely determined, are linked to each other by equations involving a small number of unknowns. By this approach, experts' opinions or historical information can be used to give a more precise estimation for those routes whose volumes are not uniquely observable. Since the direct resolution of the model via MILP solvers is time-consuming over moderate- and large-sized instances, by utilizing the problem structure, a genetic algorithm is adopted to find high-quality solutions to the model. Computational experiments over different instances, taken from the literature, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.

An adaptive inertia weight and two genetic operators were employed in the Taguchi-based whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to improve the search diversity and avoid local optima. NDT was used to model the environment of differential-drive mobile robots and WOA was applied to optimize the scan matching for the robotic SLAM problem. The NDT-WOA determines the SLAM pose estimation using sensed data from the physical world. A nonholonomic mobile robot was steered to achieve the NDT-WOA SLAM task with the derived robot kinematics and actuator dynamics. The proposed method was implemented in a TurtleBot3 Burger robotic development kit, which includes a single-board computer and an OpenCR control board. The Robot Operating System (ROS) was utilized to implement the evolutionary NDT-WOA SLAM system due to its flexibility, open source, and client library. Simulation and comparisons were conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed NDT-WOA SLAM method compared to other SLAM paradigms. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary NDT-WOA SLAM for autonomous mobile robots. The results could have theoretical and practical significance for robotics research.

AB In the process of group decision-making, different decision-makers have different risk attitudes. There are quantum entanglements among the opinions of decision-makers, influencing each other rather than being independent of each other. To address this issue, a multi-attribute quantum group decision-making method considering decision-maker's risk attitude is developed. First, considering the uncertain environment of decision-making, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy number is used to represent the decision information, and a new scoring function is proposed to transform the interval intuitionistic fuzzy matrix into a scoring function matrix. Second, the interference entanglement behavior of the decision-maker in the decision-making process is deduced by quantum probability, and the quantum probability is transformed into the weight of the attributes. Then, the prospect value function is determined according to the expectation reference point of different decision-makers, and the irrational risk attitude of decision-makers is reflected by comprehensive prospect value, which is used to rank the alternatives. Finally, a case of global telecommunication system security assessment is provided to verify the feasibility, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed method.

AB With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology and analytics compute engines, machine learning (ML) models have become increasingly complex. Unfortunately, many of these models are commonly treated as black boxes, lacking user interpretability. As a result, understanding and trusting the predictions made by such complex ML models have become more challenging. However, researchers have developed various frameworks that employ explainable AI methods to enhance the interpretability and explainability of ML models, thereby increasing the trustworthiness of their predictions. In this study, we propose a methodology called Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Shap Explanations (LIMASE). This ML explanation technique leverages Shapley values within the LIME paradigm to achieve several objectives: (a) It explains the prediction of any model by utilizing a locally faithful and interpretable decision tree model. The Tree Explainer is employed to calculate the Shapley values, enabling visually interpretable explanations, (b) It provides visually interpretable global explanations by plotting local explanations for multiple data points, (c) It offers a solution for the submodular optimization problem, (d) It provides insights into regional interpretation, and (e) It enables faster computation compared to the use of kernel explainer. By proposing the LIMASE methodology, this work contributes to the field of ML model interpretability and provides a practical solution to address the challenges posed by complex and opaque ML models. The proposed approach empowers users to gain a deeper understanding of model predictions through visually interpretable explanations at both local and global levels. Overall, this study aims to bridge the gap between the complexity of ML models and the need for interpretability, ultimately enhancing trust and usability in AI-driven applications.

AB The high complexity of graph neural networks (GNNs) on large-scale networks hinders their industrial application. Graph condensation (GCond) was recently proposed to condense the original largescale graph into a small-scale one to address the problem. The goal is to make GNNs trained on the condensed graph perform similarly to those trained on the original graph. GCond achieves satisfactory performance on some datasets. However, GCond uses a single fully connected graph to model the condensed graph, which limits the diversity of embeddings obtained, especially when there are few synthetic nodes. We propose Multiple Sparse Graphs Condensation (MSGC), which condenses the original large-scale graph into multiple small-scale sparse graphs. MSGC takes standard neighborhood patterns as the essential substructures and can construct various connection schemes. Correspondingly, GNNs can obtain numerous sets of embeddings, which significantly enriches the diversity of embeddings. Experiments show that, compared with GCond and other baselines, MSGC has significant advantages at the same condensed graph scale. MSGC can retain nearly 100% performance on Flickr and Citeseer datasets while reducing their graph scale by over 99.0%.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS

DE Counterfactual explanations; Vulnerability detection; Explainable AI
AB Counterfactual explanations highlight actionable knowledge which helps to understand how a machine learning model outcome could be altered to a more favourable outcome. Understanding actionable corrections in source code analysis can be critical to proactively mitigate security attacks that are caused by known vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present the DisCERN explainer for discovering counterfactuals for code vulnerability correction. Given a vulnerable code segment, DisCERN finds counterfactual (i.e. non-vulnerable) code segments and recommends actionable corrections. DisCERN uses feature attribution knowledge to identify potentially vulnerable code statements. Subsequently, it applies a substitution-focused correction, suggesting suitable fixes by analysing the nearest-unlike neighbour. Overall, DisCERN aims to identify vulnerabilities and correct them while preserving both the code syntax and the original functionality of the code. A user study evaluated the utility of counterfactuals for vulnerability detection and correction compared to more commonly used feature attribution explainers. The study revealed that counterfactuals foster positive shifts in mental models, effectively guiding users towards making vulnerability corrections. Furthermore, counterfactuals significantly reduced the cognitive load when detecting and correcting vulnerabilities in complex code segments. Despite these benefits, the user study showed that feature attribution explanations are still more widely accepted than counterfactuals, possibly due to the greater familiarity with the former and the novelty of the latter. These findings encourage further research and development into counterfactual explanations, as they demonstrate the potential for acceptability over time among developers as a reliable resource for both coding and training.

TI Long-term sequence dependency capture for spatiotemporal graph modeling

DE Long-term dependency; Smart city; Spatial temporal forecasting
AB Long term dependency capture is essentially important for time series prediction and spatial-temporal forecasting. In recent years, many deep learning-based forecasting methods have been proposed, leading to rapid development in this area. We systematically reviewed long-term dependency capture methods, including temporal dependency in sequence (named intra-sequence temporal dependency), temporal dependency out of sequence (named inter-sequence temporal dependency, in this scenario the long-term dependencies are split by many subsequences). Because the batch technique is widely adopted in machine learning and deep learning, the range of temporal capturing ability for many proposed methods is intra-sequence temporal dependency, which limits the capacity of long-term dependency capture. Aiming at the above problems, we designed three type memory mechanisms (i.e., a temporal encoding memory mechanism, a cross-sequence memory mechanism and a query -key based memory mechanism) to solve those long term dependency problems. Moreover, based on the cross-sequence memory mechanism and query-key architecture, an Attention-based Long -Term Dependency Capture model (ALTDC) is proposed for long-term dependency modeling and further solves the temporal dependency coherence problem. ALTDC includes temporal Transformer and spatial Transformer. The temporal Transformer adopts multi-head attention mechanism in temporal dimension and takes into consideration the relative position encoding. The spatial Transformer leverages attention mechanism in spatial dimension, and utilizes learnable position encoding and graph convolution to capture spatial relationships. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art baselines on real world time-series datasets and spatial-temporal datasets.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates the anti-synchronization (AS) problem for quaternion-valued inertial neural networks (QVINNs) with unbounded time delays. Using two different types of control strategies (feedback and adaptive controllers) and Lyapunov theory, various conditions are established to guarantee the AS of QVINNs. Most of the results available for QVINNs are based on the variable substitution approach, which reduces the order of the original second-order system into the first -order system. The quaternion-valued networks can be separated into four equivalent real-valued neural networks (RVNNs), which have made the process more complicated. However, in the present study, the authors deal with the non-reduction order method and non-separation approach for QVINNs, making the analysis approach more concise and easier to deal with inertial neural networks (INNs). Here, the QVINNs have unbounded time-varying delays since neurons' actions are related to their previous states. Hence the approach adopted here is more realistic and easy to deal with the QVINNs with unbounded time delays, which has not yet been considered by any researcher. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. In the first example, the present theoretical results have been validated, whereas the second example contains the application of quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) related to associative memory to demonstrate their capacity to restore true color image patterns accurately.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although interpretable methods for deep learning models have become popular in sentiment analysis domains in recent years, existing methods still face the challenge of providing predictions with both high accuracy and user-friendly explanations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Contrasting Logical Knowledge Learning (CLK) that utilizes contrastive learning, label knowledge, and logical rule learning. Logical rule learning is used to provide human-understandable explanations while label knowledge and contrastive learning are used to achieve high performance on both pretrained models and ordinary DNNs. To ensure model interpretability, we design a novel knowledge reasoning strategy based on learned logical rules and trained models. Empirical results from binary sentiment analysis tasks and fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks show that CLK can effectively balance accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, we conduct two case studies to demonstrate the process of explanation generation and knowledge reasoning, which shows that our method's explanations are causally consistent with the implicit model decision logic. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research proposes the use of metaheuristics for solving the Target Set Selection (TSS) problem. This problem emerges in the context of influence maximization problems, in which the objective is to maximize the number of active users when spreading information throughout a social network. Among all the influence maximization variants, TSS introduces the concept of reward of each user, which is the benefit associated to its activation. Therefore, the problem tries to maximize the reward obtained among all active users by selecting an initial set of users. Each user has also associated an activation cost, and the total sum of activation costs of the initial set of selected users cannot exceed a certain budget. In particular, two Path Relinking approaches are proposed, comparing them with the best method found in the state of the art. Additionally, a more challenging set of instances are derived from real-life social networks, where the best previous method is not able to find a feasible solution. The experimental results show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposal, supported by non-parametric statistical tests. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Stable distance of persistent homology for dynamic graph comparison

   Topological data analysis
AB Persistent homology theory provides approaches for analyzing topological features, which is now widely applied in graph comparison on social networks, biological networks, and co-location networks. These approaches utilize filtration techniques to extract the topological properties of a graph and construct vectorizations that represent these properties for further computation. However, most existing methods are designed for static scenarios and are unsuitable for the time-varying structure in realistic dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose the Stable Distance of Persistent Homology (SDPH) to compare and quantify the differences in the topological properties of dynamic graphs. In detail, we design Dynamic Dowker Filtration (DDF) to map dynamic graph to a persistent complex based on the e-interleaved theory, which enables us to trace the structure holes formed by the accumulation of temporal edge via computing the persistent homology. DDF exhibits stability and duality, inducing a time-structure triangle inequality. Based on this inequality, we finally construct Time-interlevel Kernel (TIK) for vectorizing the extracted topological features with an inner product. We conduct the graph clustering and classification experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed SDPH outperforms the baseline methods in these tasks and validate that the proposed SDPH can effectively measure the topological difference of dynamic graphs. Through SDPH, we would provide insight and inspiration on how to apply persistent homology theory to dynamic graph analysis. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI LSG-GAN: Latent space guided generative adversarial network for person

ID ERROR
AB Person pose transfer is a popular subject in computer vision tasks and is widely used in image editing, virtual try-on, and game designing. Most of the state-of-the-art models are based on flow fields and parsing maps, focusing on improving the deforming of shapes and textures. However, variances in poses always cause spatial misalignments between the source and target images; therefore, complex textures cannot be generated, especially in invisible regions. To solve this issue, we build a latent space of features to model the implicit correlations between sources and targets, and propose a latent space guided generative adversarial network (LSG-GAN) for pose transfer. The proposed model maps source features to the latent space using a feature-mapping block (FMB), and the results of the FMB are introduced into the backbone using a content-based attention mechanism. The experimental results on the DeepFashion dataset and Market1501 dataset show that the proposed model is more advanced than the existing methods, and the qualitative comparisons indicate that invisible textures can also be recovered in high quality. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) performs remarkably in visual tracking since it enables the extraction of general representations from unlabeled data and alleviates the need for expensive human annotations. SSL models usually achieve frame-to-frame communications during training by predicting each object location of intermediate frames, however, the possible prediction errors may accumulate and mislead the forward-backward tracking procedure. A novel query-communication transformer (QCT) architecture is proposed in this work to enable more reliable frame-to-frame communications via propagating query information, avoiding the above-mentioned tracking errors on intermediate frames tactfully. Specifically, we introduce the transformer into self-supervised tracking to handle the object template and search frames, i.e., the encoder encodes spatio-temporal context of template and search frames, while the decoder takes the query embedding of previous frame to retrieve the template object information from the encoder output. To further enhance the query embedding, a query interaction module is devised to promote information passing between frames. Moreover, we employ inter-frame correspondence and intra-frame correspondence to construct different views and transformations for better learning the representation from palindromic sequences. We validate our method on the seven challenging benchmarks. The results demonstrate considerable improvements over recent self-supervised algorithms and even some fully-supervised deep trackers. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, studies in many fields have widely explored diffusion in social networks, which refers to the collective behavior of a set of autonomous social actors who interact with something (such as opinions, viruses, or innovations) in social networks. Many researchers have utilized a multiagent method to explore the effects of social actor characteristics and behavioral complexity on information diffusion. This method performs well in modeling the complex characteristics and decision-making of social actors. Although this subject has been intensively studied, analyses have typically been limited to concerns about the effects of entire social network structures, such as the small-world and scale-free aspects. Few empirical information diffusion studies have systematically investigated causal effects and decision-making mechanisms under the constraints of the interaction structures of agents. In practice, we observed that the decision-making of each agent in information diffusion was significantly influenced and constrained by its contextual network structures. To solve this problem, this study utilizes the cause-effect graph method to model the interaction structures of agents in social networks and presents agent decision-making models under the constraints of local network structures in information diffusion. The proposed models and methods can be used to effectively analyze the mechanism of the influence of structured interaction relations of agents on the process of decision-making and diffusion results. Moreover, the presented decision-making model can comprehensively consider the factors of social positions of heterogeneous agents, interaction strengths, and diffusion strategies, and thus, can better match the features of real-world influence diffusion in social networks.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Subspace clustering (SC) methods have attracted widespread attention from interested researchers, and a variety of SC methods have been proposed recently. In general, SC methods obtain an affinity matrix, on which spectral clustering is used. Obviously, affinity matrices obtained by different algorithms are not the same, and their clustering effects are also different. A question then arises of whether the affinity matrices obtained by different algorithms can be merged to improve the clustering performance. The answer may be yes I n this paper, we design a new SC method, i.e., robust subspace clustering via multi-affinity matrices fusion (RSC/MAMF). Specifically, several classical SC algorithms, i.e., sparse subspace clustering (SSC), low-rank representation (LRR) and least squares regression (LSR), are first chosen to derive their own affinity matrices. To make full use of the information of different affinity matrices, and to mine the subspace structure thoroughly, we further fuse the derived affinity matrices, i.e., splice them into a 3-order tensor, and impose a weighted tensor nuclear norm (WTNN) to it, which not only mines and fuses the information of the different affinity matrices but also removes their noise. Additionally, to further explore the consistency of the different affinity matrices, spectral embedding is also unified into the final objective function. We propose an optimization algorithm to address the optimization problem of RSC/MAMF, which utilizes the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method. Experiments show that the multi-affinity matrices fusion idea is feasible, and RSC/MAMF outperforms the state-of-the-art SC methods.

ID ENTITY
AB The inter-sentence relation in a document is characterized by complex contextual information, large span of correlation and many kinds of relations, leading to the poor effect of sentence-level relation extraction models when addressing inter-sentence relations. Graph networks have been widely used in the research of document-level relation extraction due to their advantages in modeling local structural features and long-distance context dependencies. However, most previous studies modeled document in a coarse-grained manner, which ignores the richness and otherness of hierarchical features in a document. Consequently, contextual information modeling is not sufficient and fails to participate in deep reasoning efficiently. In this paper, we propose a document-level relation extraction model based on the Hierarchical Dependency Tree and Bridge Path (HDT-BP). The model uses sentence as a unit to independently extract the fine-grained features of each hierarchy and reconstructs the chain-structured document based on multiple dependent relationships into a hierarchical dependency tree. Moreover, the relational bridge entity is introduced during relation extraction to improve the model performance by modeling the bridge path feature. Experimental results demonstrate that our model exhibits superior performance on the DocRED dataset and achieves a significant improvement in extracting relational facts that never appeared in the training set. Extensive additional experiments further verify the effectiveness of our model.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Telecom fraud detection is a challenging task since the fact that fraudulent behaviors are hidden in the vast amount of telecom records. More concerning, the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) accelerated the use of mobile internet, providing more criminal opportunities for fraudsters. However, current telecom fraud detection mostly focuses on individual sequences representation, rarely noticing the collaboration of fraudsters, making it exhibit unsatisfactory performance in the face of gang crimes. To address this problem, we propose to extract collaborative networks from user call logs with an emphasis on unveiling collaborative fraud. We employ eight months of telecom datasets in China with 6,106 users and 5.0 million call logs between 1.25 million telephone recipients. Through our study, we find that the social structure of fraudsters evolute rapidly while the normal users remain stable relatively. In addition, we find that mining collaborative fraud strategies help to detect fraudsters with less distinct fraud characteristics. To this end, we propose a novel model named COllaborative-REsistant Dynamic Graph Neural Network (CORE-DGNN), to enhance the dynamic GNN aggregation process. Specifically, we first use co-recipients to obtain the collaborative network under each time slice. Then, we design a multi-frequency graph neural network to adaptively aggregate the features of node neighbors at different frequencies to address the problem of heterophily in collaborative networks. Finally, a self-attentive temporal convolutional network is designed to aggregate node embedding features across multiple time spans. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world telecom fraud datasets show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Intelligent fault diagnosis has attracted intensive efforts in machine predictive maintenance. However, the structural information from multi-sensor signals has not been fully investigated. In this study, a novel temporal-spatial graph neural network with an attention-aware module (A-TSGNN) is proposed to accomplish multi-source information fusion. First, the graph structure naturally organizes the diverse sensors. The graph convolution model realizes the feature representation in the spatial dimension. Then, time-dependent learning is applied in the temporal dimension, and a temporal-spatial learning framework is built. An additional attention module is designed to learn the flexible weights and model the importance of individual sensors and their correlations. Experiments on a wind turbine dataset achieves an accuracy of 0.9669 and an F1-score of 0.9649. For the gearbox dataset, the values are 0.9927 and 0.9920, respectively. The overall macro-average area under the curve metrics reach a perfect score of 1.00 for both datasets, indicating exceptional performance. The adaptive attention mechanism is also discussed to verify the superiority of the A-TSGNN. Furthermore, comparisons with the single-sensor scheme and other fusion models demonstrate the stable performance of the proposed method. The A-TSGNN provides a potential model for comprehensively utilizing multi-sensor data, showing a promising prospect.

ID RECOGNITION; FUSION
AB Multimodal entity-based sentiment analysis (MEBSA) is an emerging task in sentiment analysis that aims to identify three key elements (entity, entity category, and sentiment polarity) from a pair of sentence and image. However, most existing studies have primarily focused on one or two MEBSA subtasks, ignoring the fact that these subtasks are closely related with one another. Moreover, previous studies focused on the detection of coarse-grained entity categories, which failed to provide sufficient information to disambiguate entities. To address these two issues, we introduced a new task called multimodal entity-category-sentiment triple extraction (MECSTE) to extract entities, their corresponding fine-grained entity categories, and sentiment polarities simultaneously. We constructed two datasets for this task based on two existing Twitter corpora. Moreover, we developed a generative multimodal approach based on a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model that formulates the MECSTE task as a paraphrase generation problem by linearising all the entity-category-sentiment triples into a natural language sentence. Extensive experiments on the annotated Twitter datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   SIMILARITY
AB Label distribution learning is a widely studied supervised learning diagram that can handle the problem of label ambiguity. The increasing size of datasets is accompanied by the disaster of dimensionality, which implies that the arrival of redundant and noisy features undermines the effect of label distribution learning. As a crucial data-preprocessing technique, feature selection is capable of choosing discriminative features. However, due to the complex issue of label ambiguity, traditional feature selection approaches for datasets with logical labels cannot be applied to label distribution data. In this paper, a novel granular ball computing-based fuzzy rough set (GBFRS) is proposed for label distribution feature selection. Specifically, the proposed method is first introduced at the finest granularity, i.e., calculating similarity relations between single data points. Considering that the label ambiguity issue is exacerbated by the label imbalance phenomenon, the relative similarity in label distribution space among samples is computed for better generalization of the model. Then, a robust approximation strategy is devised for the target sample by using its true different and partially different class samples. Finally, with the concept of granular balls, the method explores the similarity relations between balls and samples, and the granular ball computing-based fuzzy rough set method is developed , which is endowed with the ability to simulate the characteristics of large-scale priorities in human thinking and considers local consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on twenty-two datasets show that GBFRS can effectively select more significant features than seven state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID IMMUNE-SYSTEM
AB The negative selection algorithm (NSA) is an essential algorithm in the artificial immune system used to achieve anomaly detection by generating detectors. The traditional NSA algorithm generates candidate detectors randomly, which leads to a partially dense and redundant distribution of detectors in the nonself areas, resulting in the presence of holes that are not covered by detectors. A detector generation algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (DGA-PSO) is proposed to overcome these defects. DGA-PSO converts the self-tolerance process into an adaptation function to guide particles to move in a specific direction by artificial settings and variants, generates efficient detectors covering the nonself space, reduces the redundancy among detectors and fills holes not covered. Thus, we successfully reduce the number of detectors while improving the detection rate of the algorithm. Through experimental validation analysis, DGA-PSO ranks first in detector training time and the detection rate on four UCI datasets compared to the classical algorithms RNSA and V-Detector and the improved algorithms BIORV-NSA, ADC-NSA and IFB-NSA.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Lightweight network; Multi-scale feature
AB Current methods for few-shot segmentation focus on extracting information from support and query targets, however, most of these methods not only suffer from high model complexity but also fail to capture long-range interactions between query features and support features. To efficiently reduce the information loss due to the appearance inconsistency in spatial between support and query objects and make full use of the limited features extracted from support and query samples, we present a lightweight multi-scale feature enrichment network named Lite-FENet that enhances multi-scale feature interactions and ensures the discrimination with the final features under low computational cost. Specifically, we design a lightweight and efficient spatial interaction module for the Lite-FENet to achieve the contextual information transfer between different spatial scales over long distances. The repeated interactions generate a descriptive feature, and show superior robustness for pixel-level prediction, especially when there is a gap between different instances. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 63.5% and 64.7% MIoU on the PASCAL-5i dataset, and 39.5% and 43.1% MIoU on the COCO-20i datasets under 1-shot and 5-shot settings with only 6.7M learnable parameters, respectively, which significantly exceeds the results of current methods, while ensuring a far smaller model size.

   neural network
AB Deep learning models have emerged as a promising way for traffic prediction. However, the require-ment for large amounts of training data remains a significant issue for achieving well-performing models. Data scarcity in real-world scenarios, caused by costly collection or privacy policies, can severely impede the performance of existing deep learning models. Transfer learning aims to leverage knowledge learned from data-sufficient cities to improve prediction performance in data-scarce cities. Unfortunately, most existing methods solely focus on transferring knowledge at the city level, neglecting fine-grained node-level correlations and distribution discrepancies between cities. In this paper, we propose DAGN, a domain adversarial graph neural network that mines inter-city spatial- temporal correlations and alleviates domain distribution discrepancies to address the data scarcity problem in traffic prediction. Specifically, DAGN comprises three key modules: (1) A cross-city graph structure learning module is developed to capture node-pair adjacent relationships across cities, enabling the dynamic aggregation of inter-city spatial-temporal information. Additionally, a graph reconstruction loss is proposed to enforce structural consistency between the learned and priori graphs. (2) A domain adversarial strategy is integrated with a spatial-temporal module, which jointly extracts domain-invariant spatial and temporal features to reduce the distribution discrepancies between cities. (3) To adaptively extract transferable knowledge from a global perspective, a global spatial-temporal attention module is designed. Extensive experiments on six traffic flow and traffic speed prediction benchmarks demonstrate that DAGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Adversarial distillation; Lightweight models; Self-supervised learning
ID KNOWLEDGE
AB With the development of modern sensors, numerous images are collected in edge application scenarios; however, their utilization is quite expensive because a massive effort is required to label them for further usage. Self-supervised learning, with no need for labeled data, shows great potential in this context; however, notable performance degradations can be observed when training lightweight networks which are essential in edge implementation. We propose an effective distillation method called Adversarial Distilled Contrastive Learning (ADCL) to mitigate this issue. Specifically, we introduced knowledge distillation into self-supervised learning to transfer underlying feature clustering relations from teacher models to shallow models. We adopted an online-updated rather than a pretrained teacher model to realize convenient implementation to specific data domains. An adversarial loss item was introduced to alleviate unstable optimization caused by an online trained teacher by forcing the teacher model to find feature relations beyond the recognition of the student model. Compared with other self-supervised knowledge distillation methods that maintain data queues consisting of positive and negative examples, the asymmetric contrastive learning method was employed to further relieve the memory bottleneck during training. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of our method. When ResNet-50 is used as a teacher to teach ResNet-18 on ImageNet, ADCL achieves top-1 accuracies of 60.3% , which surpasses other knowledge distillation methods with online teachers and is comparable to approaches using pretrained teachers and data queues. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Time expression normalization; Neural semantic parsing; Update semantics

AB Existing approaches to normalize time expressions highly rely on expert-engineered rules or grammars, which are labor-intensive and difficult to scale to different scenarios. In this article, we formulate a novel idea to model the semantics of time expression as update operations. We use the update semantics-based representation to model the normalization task as predicting an operation sequence from a given natural language sequence, which is compatible with the popular Seq2Seq scheme in deep learning. We propose a distantly supervised neural parsing approach DNPTime for parsing the time expressions. DNPTime parses recognized expressions into executable operations to obtain normalized values. Specifically, DNPTime uses the intermediate results from the automatic rule generation approach ARTime to construct distant supervision samples for fine-tuning T5 models. Experimental results show that DNPTime gives the best average performances on different benchmarks with fewer human interventions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID NETWORK
AB Incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) into recommender systems (RS) has recently attracted increasing attention. For large-scale KGs, due to limited labour supervision, noises are inevitably introduced during automatic construction. However, the effects of such noises as untrustworthy information in KGs on RS are unclear, and how to retain RS performing well while encountering such untrustworthy information has yet to be solved. Motivated by them, we study the effects of the trustworthiness of the KG on RS and propose a novel method trustworthiness-aware knowledge graph representation (KGR) for recommendation (TrustRec). TrustRec introduces a trustworthiness estimator into noise tolerant KGR methods for collaborative filtering. Specifically, to assign trustworthiness, we leverage internal structures of KGs from microscopic to macroscopic levels: motifs, communities and global information, to reflect the true degree of triple expression. Building on this estimator, we then propose trustworthiness integration to learn noise-tolerant KGR and item representations for RS. We conduct extensive experiments to show the superior performance of TrustRec over state-of-the-art recommendation methods. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The combination of networks and knowledge graphs (KGs) improves the accuracy and interpretability of networks in image classification. Previous methods fuse the entire KG with each sample. However, there is limited knowledge related to specific samples for the entire KG. The fusion process of the previous method includes some useless redundant knowledge, resulting in suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we propose a selective interactive network based on a knowledge graph, which builds a bidirectional communication bridge for knowledge and data. Specifically, we design an attention based knowledge selection module that utilizes data to select effective knowledge from the KG, filtering out some useless knowledge involved in the subsequent fusion process. Meanwhile, we introduce knowledge selection loss that measures the consistency between knowledge and image features to achieve the effective selection of knowledge through data. Then, we employ a bilinear fusion method to combine the selected knowledge and image features to improve the recognition performance of the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the IDRiD and CUB-200-2011 datasets demonstrate the stateof-the-art performance of the proposed method, especially on the small dataset IDRiD, where the proposed method outperforms the baseline by 6.79% in accuracy. The knowledge selection mechanism establishes the association between predicted classes and the KG, and thus provides attribute descriptions for predicted classes, which has stronger interpretability. The visualization results demonstrate that our model captures more stable image features. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We consider preference disaggregation in the context of multiple criteria sorting. The value function parameters and thresholds separating the classes are inferred from the Decision Maker's (DM's) assignment examples. Given the multiplicity of sorting models compatible with indirect preferences, selecting a single, representative one can be conducted differently. We review several procedures for this purpose, aiming to identify the most discriminant, average, central, parsimonious, or robust models. Also, we present three novel procedures that implement the robust assignment rule in practice. They exploit stochastic acceptabilities and maximize the support given to the resulting assignments by all feasible sorting models. The performance of fourteen procedures is verified on problem instances with different complexities. The results of an experimental study indicate the most efficient procedures in terms of classification accuracy, reproducing the DM's model, and delivering the most robust assignments. These include approaches identifying differently interpreted centers of the feasible polyhedron and robust methods introduced in this paper. Moreover, we discuss how the performance of all procedures is affected by different numbers of classes, criteria, characteristic points, and reference assignments.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

DE Malware variants detection; Heterogeneous graph; Interaction-enhanced
   model; Structural embedding; Temporal graph embedding
AB Advanced malware variants attacks have been posing catastrophes to the cyber ecosystem. However, existing malware variants detection methods are feeble for detecting the advanced malware variants due to the twofold flaws. First, most detection methods focus on analyzing the isolated features instead of investigating the meaningful contextual interactions between fine-grained malware entities, resulting in poor performance. Second, the existing graph-based detection approaches are incapable of leveraging the temporal dependence information between execution behaviors to capture the malicious evolutionary patterns and incur expensive time costs when traversing vast invalid paths. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes TI-MVD, a temporal interaction-enhanced malware variants detection framework. TI-MVD models the fine-grained malware objects with a temporal heterogeneous graph, which can simultaneously leverage the temporal and structural embedding features to detect malware variants. Concretely, a novel end-to-end interaction-enhanced embedding approach is proposed to learn the structural embedding, which is capable of incorporating explicit and implicit interactive information between node pairs to boost detection effectiveness. Meanwhile, a strong-correlated clique method exploiting two coupled GRUs is presented to handle the temporal interactions in a parallel manner, which can drastically reduce the time cost of temporal embedding. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed TI-MVD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

ID EXPLANATIONS; EXPLICATION; USABILITY
AB This paper presents a new method for objectively measuring the explainability of textual information, such as the outputs of Explainable AI (XAI). We introduce a metric called Degree of Explainability (DoX), drawing inspiration from Ordinary Language Philosophy and Achinstein's theory of explanations. It assumes that the degree of explainability is directly proportional to the number of relevant questions that a piece of information can correctly answer. We have operationalized this concept by formalizing the DoX metric through a mathematical formula, which we have integrated into a software tool named DoXpy. DoXpy relies on pre-trained deep language models for knowledge extraction and answer retrieval in order to estimate the DoX, transforming our theoretical insights into a practical tool for real-world applications. To confirm the effectiveness and consistency of our approach, we conducted comprehensive experiments and user studies with over 190 participants. These studies evaluated the quality of explanations by healthcare and finance XAI-based software systems. Our results demonstrate a correlation between increases in objective explanation usability and increments in the DoX score. These findings suggest that the DoX metric is congruent with other mainstream explainability measures. It provides a more objective and cost-effective alternative to non-deterministic user studies. Thus, we discuss the potential of DoX as a tool to evaluate the legal compliance of XAI systems. By bridging the gap between theory and practice in Explainable AI, our work fosters transparency, understandability, and legal compliance. DoXpy and related materials have been made available online to ensure reproducibility. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Language prior; Visual question answering; Visual shortcut; Robust VQA
AB Existing Visual Question Answering models suffer from the language prior, where the answers provided by the models overly rely on the correlations between questions and answers, ignoring the exact visual information, resulting in a significant drop in the out-of-distribution datasets. To eliminate such language bias, prevalent approaches mainly focus on weakening the language prior with one auxiliary question-only branch while focusing on the statistical question type-answer pairs' distribution prior rather than that of question-answer pairs. Besides, most models provide the answer with improper visual groundings. This paper proposes a model-agnostic framework to address the above drawbacks by question-conditioned debiasing with focal visual context fusion. To begin with, instead of the question type-conditioned correlations, we overcome the language distribution shortcut from the aspect of question-conditioned correlations by removing the shortcut between questions and the most occurring answer. Additionally, we utilize the deviation of the predicted answer distribution and ground truth as the pseudo target to avoid the model falling into other frequent answers' distribution bias. Further, we stress the imbalance of the number of images and questions that post higher requirements of a proper visual context. We improve the correct visual utilization ability based on contrastive sampling and design a focal visual context fusion module that incorporates the critical object word extracted from the question after the Part-Of-Speech tagging into the visual features to augment the salient visual information without human annotations. Extensive experiments on the three public benchmark datasets, i.e., VQA v2, VQA-CP v2, and VQA-CP v1, demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID MODEL
AB Accurate user modeling is crucial for point-of-interest (POI) recommendation as it can significantly improve user satisfaction with recommended POIs and enrich user experience. However, existing methods typically rely on simple time-series models for user check-in sequences, which ignore similar information of global users and fail to capture the user-preference knowledge hidden in complex social networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel knowledge-driven and user-aware POI recommendation method called KDRank. First, we construct a knowledge graph containing users' personal attributes for POI recommendation, which can reflect users' historical check-in preferences. Second, we derive users' knowledge representations using a cross-embedding method, which facilitates feature interaction by sharing information between segments of knowledge representations to achieve a more precise representation of low-dimensional embedding. Third, we propose a knowledge aggregation module to combine users' knowledge and historical check-in features to achieve knowledge enhancement of check-in data. Furthermore, to enhance global user awareness of our model, we introduce an attention mechanism that focuses on the most similar and significant users in the global context. It allows KDRank to capture more personalized user preferences and increases the precision of POI recommendations. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated on two real datasets, and the results indicated its ability to increase the POI recommendation accuracy.

AB Video anomaly detection (VAD) involves identifying events or behaviours in video sequences that deviate from expected patterns. Most VAD models to date focus on seeking continuous improvement by directly learning identifiable visual cues from information-rich appearance data, regardless of the critical issue of privacy and data security in public places. This paper explores the possibility of addressing privacy-preserving VAD by privacy-independent data, such as human body skeleton and optical flow. However, due to the imbalanced nature of normality and anomaly, direct learning of the consistency of heterogeneous data may result in normality bias. To address the issues, we propose a novel motion exemplar-guided approach (a.k.a. Prime) that explicitly incorporates the support set of human skeleton poses into the VAD framework for breaking through the usefulness-versus-privacy dilemma. The support set containing diverse motion exemplars from the large-scale human skeletonbased action database enables our model to disentangle the coarsely defined anomalies. To learn the abnormal consistency between poses and optical flow, we introduce a Non-Minimum Suppression (NMS) strategy that adaptively highlights the correlation of anomalous pairs. The proposed architecture allows us to train our model with both fully and weakly-supervised paradigms in an end-to-end manner. We conducted performance evaluations of our method on three well-established datasets for VAD tasks: UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech. These evaluations were carried out in both privacy and non-privacy settings to assess the effectiveness of our approach. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, both in fully-supervised and weakly-supervised paradigms.

However, most of the research has overlooked the disturbance factors in the processing environment, such as the arrival of new jobs. To address this issue, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) with Q-learning has been developed. First, an iterated greedy algorithm (IG) is proposed to generate an initial solution for the first stage. Then, the NSGA-II algorithm is designed to optimize dual-objective problems in the second stage, and the Q-learning algorithm is used to adjust the algorithm parameters. Next, two local search strategies based on key factories are adopted, including critical factory-based insert and swap operations. Finally, a comprehensive experiment of the proposed algorithm against other advanced multiobjective algorithms is conducted. The results confirm that the proposed algorithm can solve the distributed permutation flowshop rescheduling problem with high efficiency.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Image-driven social sensing (ISS) is emerging as a pervasive sensing paradigm that collects the status of the physical world by leveraging image data from human sensors. This paper studies a dynamic hyperparameter optimization problem in ISS applications and our objective is to dynamically determine the optimal hyperparameter configuration of an AI-based ISS solution that provides the accurate label for each image in the data stream of ISS applications. Our work is motivated by the observation that current ISS solutions leverage a static hyperparameter configuration that is often configured manually by AI experts, which fails to capture the potential large dynamics of ISS applications. To address this limitation, we develop DC-HPO, a dynamic crowd-assisted hyperparameter optimization system that utilizes crowdsourced human intelligence to dynamically steer the search of the optimal hyperparameter configuration for each image in the data stream of ISS applications. The experimental results on two ISS applications from real world (i.e., intelligent urban infrastructure monitoring and city environment cleanliness assessment) demonstrate that DC-HPO outperforms existing deep convolutional neural networks, crowd-AI models, and hyperparameter optimization methods in achieving the best ISS performance while keeping the lowest computational cost.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) is an essential task in many applications such as health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports training. Sensor-based HAR has received increasing attention due to the widespread availability of sensors in daily life. In this paper, we propose two novel architectures, the convolution with self-attention network (CSNet) and the temporal-channel convolution with selfattention network (TCCSNet), for classifying sequences of human activity data from different sensors. CSNet leverages both convolution and self-attention to capture both local and global dependencies in the input data, while TCCSNet exploits both temporal and inter-channel dependencies through two branches of convolutions and self-attentions for extracting time-wise and channel-wise information. The proposed methods are evaluated on seven different sensor-based HAR datasets, namely: MHEALTH, PAMAP2, UTD1, UTD2, WHARF, USC-HAD, and WISDM, using the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation protocol. Our experiments show that the proposed models outperform other modern approaches, such as Transformers and long short-term memory (LSTM) based models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Complex question answering (CQA) over knowledge bases(KB) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Semantic parsing-based methods face challenges such as poor adaptability for incomplete KB, large search spaces, and high costs to label logic forms. The gap between knowledge graph representations and question token embeddings leads to poor generalizability and uninterpretable reasoning of information retrieval-based methods. We propose an interpretable and scalable system called Predict, Pretrained, Select and Answer (PPSA) to solve CQA tasks over KB. Our system first trains a language model to predict the reasoning paths required to answer questions. We select only the entities that the predicted reasoning paths pass through in the knowledge graph as candidate entities to reduce the amount of distracting information. The paths that connect the topic entity and the selected candidate entity along with the question are then fed into another language model for answer prediction. The answer prediction module loads the parameters of the trained path prediction module before training to improve accuracy. The system reduces the search space by predicting the path and does not need expensive logic forms annotation. The textual path is the input to the language model, which bridges the gap between the graph representations and token embeddings. We analyse the system reasoning ability over knowledge graphs with different degrees of sparseness, and evaluate the system generalizability. The results of experiments performed with the Complex WebQuestions and WebQuestionsSP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for CQA task.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Building a multimodal humor-aided dialogue generation system in a multilingual setting is a very challenging task and it could even be more challenging in the Hindi language because of its morpho-logical richness and free word order. Existing works only solved the problem of unimodal humorous dialogue generation, not humor-aided, in a monolingual setting. However, due to the tremendous growth in multimodal and multilingual content, there is a great demand to build multimodal humor-aided systems that support multilingual information access. To this end, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based multimodal sentiment and emotion-aware humor-aided multiparty dialogue gen-eration in multilingual (Hindi and English) setting. We evaluate our proposed approach (MHaDiG) on the recently released Sentiment, Humor, and Emotion-aware Multilingual Multimodal Multiparty Dataset (SHEMuD). Experimental results show the efficacy of MHaDiG and show the effect of multilingualism over monolingualism in the multimodal conversational setting.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Graph representation learning; Motif Coarsening; MotifRe-Weighting
ID NETWORKS
AB Motifs, as fundamental units of the graph, play a significant role in modeling complex systems in a variety of domains, including social networks, as well as biology and neuroscience. Motif preservation is a widely studied problem that provides new avenues for structure preservation. This paper is dedicated to exploring the significance of motifs with various patterns and effectively incorporating different motif patterns into node-level graph representation learning. We propose a novel node Representation learning framework via Motif Coarsening (RMC), which effectively incorporates different granularity structural information into node representation learning. RMC consists of two parallel components, the node representation learning aggregator and the motif-based node representation learning aggregator. In the node representation learning process, RMC directly encodes lower-order structures into node representation by a one-layer graph convolution network. For the motif-based node representation learning process, we propose a Motif Coarsening strategy for incorporating motif structure into the graph representation learning process. Furthermore, the MotifRe-Weighting strategy is proposed to bi-ased convert motif representation into motif-based node representation. We verify the effectiveness of RMC by several node-related tasks on a series of widely used real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework delivers superior promising representation performance to existing benchmarks. Ablation experiments proved that RMC has potential as an auxiliary framework, which indicates the excellent quality of Motif Coarsening and MotifRe-Weighting strategies over existing benchmarks from several evaluation metrics, involving mean classification accuracy, Micro-F1, and Macro-F1. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Collaborative filtering; Variational autoencoder; Rank; Actor-critic;
   Adaptive loss
ID ALGORITHM
AB Research on variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering is gradually focusing on implicit feedback. However, most existing studies have two limitations: (1) they overlook the impact of user- item interaction data in implicit feedback on the representations of both users and items, which can affect the latent representations; (2) their attention is mainly focused on the immediate feedback of recommended items, ignoring interactions between feedback and ground-truth values, and neglecting the difference on loss functions between different training processes. To address these limitations, we first propose a condition for variational autoencoders to control user and item representations to learn more useful information from the latent representations. Then, we train an adaptive loss critic ranking to directly provide ranking scores in collaborative filtering recommendations, which aims to minimize loss and improve interactions during different critic training processes. Extensive experiments on three big real-world social media datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms the existing twelve models under NDCG and Recall metric estimation settings and significantly improves the performance of a variety of prediction models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over the past years, knowledge graph embedding approaches have proven effective for knowledge graph completion tasks. However, most existing models are either built on a certain embedding space or black-box neural networks, making it hard to access explanations for prediction results and resulting in limited explainability. In this paper, we propose to leverage information entropy to quantify the importance of explanation candidates, then build a framework KE-X, for explaining results from knowledge graph embedding approaches by generating explainable subgraphs. Specifically, by performing a modified message passing mechanism on a partially masked knowledge subgraph and maximizing knowledge information gain, KE-X can extract the most valuable subgraph explanation for a link prediction query. To evaluate KE-X, we conduct experiments on three real-world knowledge graphs with two representative KGE models, TransE and DistMult. Both quantitative and case study results show that our framework can extract high-quality explanations. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Partially labeled and skewed datasets are common in many applications including healthcare, due to the high costs and time constraints of data collection and annotation. However, training machine learning classifiers on such data can undermine their prediction performances. In this paper, we propose a novel classifier to address this problem by focusing on the Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is widely recognized as a more robust performance metric for skewed datasets than other metrics such as accuracy and error rate. We introduce a new classifier called PSVM-AUC Maximizer (PSVM-AUCMax) which is based on Proximal Support Vector Machines (PSVM) and directly maximizes a new AUC-based metric in its learning objective. PSVM-AUCMax has several merits. First, by directly integrating the maximization of the proposed AUC-based metric, PSVM-AUCMax can be proved to have the enhanced generalization capability on the partially labeled and skewed dataset. Second, it simplifies the model selection process with fewer tuning hyperparameters. Third, PSVM-AUCMax's analytical solution remains the same form as traditional PSVM, preserving its advantages such as fast incremental updating in incremental learning scenarios. The efficacy of PSVM-AUCMax has been demonstrated through extensive experiments on several public datasets and a healthcare case study using data collected at the US Mayo Clinic. In the healthcare case study, we utilized PSVM-AUCMax to develop a clinical prediction model for forecasting composite outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients which yielded promising results.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Multi-label learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that study the classification problem of data associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Ensemble-based method is one of the representa-tive methods in multi-label learning. In the existing ensemble-based multi-label classification methods, the essence of its base learner is still a binary or multi-class classifier. At present, there is no ensemble-based multi-label method that uses a multi-label classifier based on algorithm adaptation as a base learner. Multi-label algorithms suffer from expensive time costs, and ensemble-based methods further exacerbate the time cost. To address these issues, we propose an efficient multi-label classification method based on kernel extreme learning machine and ensemble learning. Firstly, to solve the problem of high time complexity of multi-label classifiers, we use a Gaussian kernel function to generate a kernel extreme learning machine based multi-label classifier (KELM_ML). Then, based on random sampling, we construct the base classifier, i.e., KELM_ML, in ensemble learning. Finally, to build an ensemble model of multi-label classifiers, an elimination optimization ensemble strategy is proposed by defining an encoding vector of the base classifiers and updating it. Although our method is an ensemble model, it inherits the advantages of good time complexity of ELM, i.e., fast learning time. The experimental and statistical results show that compared with baseline methods and other ensemble-based multi-label methods, our proposed method has better classification performance and stable results.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Data uncertainty; Top -k query; Data relation uncertainty; Unified model
AB Data uncertainty (DU), one of the most interesting topics in information science, inevitably leads to data relation uncertainty (DRU). Moreover, DU greatly affects the results of information processing problems such as sorting and top-k queries with uncertain data. However, studies have not clarified the mechanism, mode, and degree of impact of DU on DRU. Hence, we established a unified mathematical model to reveal the precise relation between DU and DRU. The experimental results showed this model's high accuracy under various conditions and its relative error and absolute error of less than 0.2%. This model can be used to quantitatively estimate DRU according to a given DU and vice versa. Unexpectedly, the experiments showed that under given conditions, high DU will not necessarily lead to high DRU. This characteristic is highly significant to the design of data sorting and query algorithms with uncertain data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Time series; Adversarial attack; Smooth perturbations; InceptionTime;
   BIM
AB Adversarial attacks represent a threat to every deep neural network. They are particularly effective if they can perturb a given model while remaining undetectable. They have been initially introduced for image classifiers, and are well studied for this task. For time series, few attacks have yet been proposed. Most that have are adaptations of attacks previously proposed for image classifiers. Although these attacks are effective, they generate perturbations containing clearly discernible patterns such as sawtooth and spikes. Adversarial patterns are not perceptible on images, but the attacks proposed to date are readily perceptible in the case of time series. In order to generate stealthier adversarial attacks for time series, we propose a new attack that produces smoother perturbations. We introduced a function to measure the smoothness for time series. Using it, we find that smooth perturbations are harder to detect both visually, by the naked eye and by deep learning models. We also show two ways of protection against adversarial attacks: the first one by detecting the attacks using a deep model; the second one by using adversarial training to improve the robustness of a model against a specific attack, thus making it less vulnerable.

ID COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIAGENT; GAME
AB Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant results, most notably by leveraging the representation-learning abilities of deep neural networks. However, large centralized approaches quickly become infeasible as the number of agents scale, and fully decentralized approaches can miss important opportunities for information sharing and coordination. Furthermore, not all agents are equal-in some cases, individual agents may not even have the ability to send communication to other agents or explicitly model other agents. This paper considers the case where there is a single, powerful, central agent that can observe the entire observation space, and there are multiple, low-powered local agents that can only receive local observations and are not able to communicate with each other. The central agent's job is to learn what message needs to be sent to different local agents based on the global observations, not by centrally solving the entire problem and sending action commands, but by determining what additional information an individual agent should receive so that it can make a better decision. In this work, we present our MARL algorithm HAMMER, describe where it would be most applicable, and implement it in the cooperative navigation and multi-agent walker domains. Empirical results show that (1) learned communication does indeed improve system performance, (2) results generalize to heterogeneous local agents, and (3) results generalize to different reward structures.

DE Distribution system state estimation; Transformer; Bi-directional LSTM;
   Huber-loss function; Missing data; Smart meters
ID ALGORITHM
AB The solution of the distribution system state estimation (DSSE) relies on the presence of physical measurements in real time. Sometimes, these measurements may not reach the control center due to the defects in meter functionality, the large communication time delays, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on communication channels. Addressing this issue, a novel deep learning (DL) approach is proposed by using a transformer model with the integration of bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) layer. The proposed model can be leveraged to forecast the unavailable measurement data, which maintains the observability of the system to obtain an accurate solution from DSSE. The superiority of the proposed model is probed by comparing it with other forecasting-based DL models at various percentages of missing measurement data. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated for forecasting the power injections of residential, commercial, and industrial loads as well as renewable energy sources. Finally, the solution of the DSSE is tested with forecasted data and compared with the results of the DSSE for the original measurement data. The simulations are performed on modified IEEE 13-node and IEEE 37-node test systems, and their corresponding results highlighted the superiority of the proposed model in the forecasting of the incomplete data.

AB Interactions between light and matter during short-pulse water-jet guided laser materials processing are highly nonlinear, and acutely sensitive to laser machining parameters. Traditionally, the physical simulation calculation methods based on laser, water and composite materials are complicated. This work combines neural networks and physical simulation models in the understanding of laser drilling of composite materials. Neural networks are used to predict SiC/SiC composites laser drilling results by using processing parameters (average power, scanning speed, and filling spacing) as input parameters, optimal combinations of processing parameters based on the neural network are identified, and the effectiveness of the learned knowledge is validated using a physical simulation model. The results show that the neural network can identify the nonlinear effect of processing parameters on machining quality with the MAE of 0.054 and the RMSE of 0.067. The physical simulation model could explain why this nonlinear effect exists. This method can be applied to a wide range of fields. In the face of unknown material and physical processing processes, the approach of combining neural networks and physical simulation models has the potential to significantly reduce the optimization time and deepen the understanding of laser processing.

AB Accurately and intelligently detecting faults is critical to implement smart manufacturing regarding cost reduction and manufacturing system reliability. Recent boosting deep learning technology has been widely used for fault diagnosis (FD) and obtained great success. However, most of them require collecting sufficient data to train the model while it is difficult and even not available sometimes due to the system faults' variability and randomness. To overcome this issue, this article presents a novel and effective deep model named dual-level multi-scale convolution neural network (DL-MSCNN) for FD with limited training samples. Primarily, it utilizes dual-level multi-scale schemes to extract rich hidden features from raw signals for accurate FD. Firstly, the raw signals are preprocessed by differ-scale average window functions to obtain its grain-level scale representation. Secondly, each grain-level scale feature is fed into a multi-scale cascade CNN (implemented with different kernels) to mine its deeper and detail-level scale representation. Various detail-level scale representations are fused as the fusion features of each grain-level scale CNN (GL-SCNN) representation. Besides, one multi-task supervised scheme (MTSS) is developed to supervise each detail-level scale CNN (DL-SCNN) to learn thoroughly. Finally, the comprehensive features are integrated from all detail-level representations for FD. The authors designed, trained, and tested the proposed method on three real data sets. The comparative analysis confirmed the proposed method's effectiveness with scarce training samples. In addition, we also proved that the MTSS has a good generality for FD on other multi-scale structures.

AB The world is characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). In such an environment, the viability in terms of digitalization, resilience, and sustainability capabilities has gained worldwide attention in supply chain management. Therefore, it is crucial to give special consideration to these paradigms when selecting suppliers. Moreover, the availability of data in digital supply chain systems can aid in supplier selection by using Artificial Intelligence techniques to identify viable suppliers. This approach can streamline the supplier selection process and lead to more efficient and effective manufacturing operations. Thus, it is necessary to have a big data analytics infrastructure in today's data-driven world. In this context, this paper aims to design a multi-agent system that belongs to the theory of Distributed Artificial Intelligence based on big data analytics to give a strong tool for finding the best viable suppliers based on a thorough and data-driven evaluation. To do so, designing a multi-agent-based big data analytics system model necessitates identifying the multiple criteria needed for selecting viable suppliers in real-time decision-making. To this end, through a literature review, this paper analyzes more than 140 publications and identifies the main criteria needed for viable suppliers' selection in the VUCA world. Therefore, the proposed system can be used as an intelligent viable supplier selection that improves the quality of the process and controls it while considering different capabilities. It presents a comprehensive model for viable supplier selection, consisting of four main layers: decision-making system, data resources, supplier selection, and big data analytics. The model incorporates six types of agents: Suppliers agent, Resource Agent, Knowledge Management Agent, Pilot Agent, Analyst Agent, and Decision-Making Agent. The integration of these layers and agents enables real-time data-driven decision-making, contributing to the selection of viable suppliers in a volatile and uncertain environment. The proposed model enhances supply chain performance in the digital era, offering a robust tool for both academics and practitioners to improve the quality of supplier selection.

AB Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized advanced digital picture processing, enabling significant advancements in computer vision (CV). However, it is important to note that older CV techniques, developed prior to the emergence of DL, still hold value and relevance. Particularly in the realm of more complex, three-dimensional (3D) data such as video and 3D models, CV and multimedia retrieval remain at the forefront of technological advancements. We provide critical insights into the progress made in developing higher-dimensional qualities through the application of DL, and also discuss the advantages and strategies employed in DL. With the widespread use of 3D sensor data and 3D modeling, the analysis and representation of the world in three dimensions have become commonplace. This progress has been facilitated by the development of additional sensors, driven by advancements in areas such as 3D gaming and self-driving vehicles. These advancements have enabled researchers to create feature description models that surpass traditional two-dimensional approaches. This study reveals the current state of advanced digital picture processing, highlighting the role of DL in pushing the boundaries of CV and multimedia retrieval in handling complex, 3D data.

AB Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a disease that manifests itself with a deteriora-tion in all mental activities, daily activities, and behaviors, especially memory, due to the constantly increasing damage to some parts of the brain as people age. Detecting AD at an early stage is a significant challenge. Various diagnostic devices are used to diagnose AD. Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) devices are widely used to analyze and classify the stages of AD. However, the time-consuming process of recording the affected areas of the brain in the images obtained from these devices is another challenge. Therefore, conventional techniques cannot detect the early stage of AD.Methods. In this study, we proposed a deep learning model supported by a fusion loss model that includes fully connected layers and residual blocks to solve the above -mentioned challenges. The proposed model has been trained and tested on the publicly available T1-weighted MRI-based KAGGLE dataset. Data augmentation techniques were used after various preliminary operations were applied to the data set.Results. The proposed model effectively classified four AD classes in the KAGGLE dataset. The proposed model reached the test accuracy of 0.973 in binary classification and 0.982 in multi-class classification thanks to experimental studies and provided a superior classification performance than other studies in the literature. The proposed method can be used online to detect AD and has the feature of a system that will help doctors in the decision-making process.

AB The correction of grammatical errors in natural language processing is a crucial task as it aims to enhance the accuracy and intelligibility of written language. However, developing a grammatical error correction (GEC) framework for low-resource languages presents significant challenges due to the lack of available training data. This article proposes a novel GEC framework for low-resource languages, using Arabic as a case study. To generate more training data, we propose a semi-supervised confusion method called the equal distribution of synthetic errors (EDSE), which generates a wide range of parallel training data. Additionally, this article addresses two limitations of the classical seq2seq GEC model, which are unbalanced outputs due to the unidirectional decoder and exposure bias during inference. To overcome these limitations, we apply a knowledge distillation technique from neural machine translation. This method utilizes two decoders, a forward decoder right-to-left and a backward decoder left-to-right, and measures their agreement using Kullback-Leibler divergence as a regularization term. The experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the Transformer baseline and two widely used bidirectional decoding techniques, namely asynchronous and synchronous bidirectional decoding. Furthermore, the proposed framework reported the highest F1 score, and generating synthetic data using the equal distribution technique for syntactic errors resulted in a significant improvement in performance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for improving grammatical error correction for low-resource languages, particularly for the Arabic language.

AB Social media has become an essential source of news for everyday users. However, the rise of fake news on social media has made it more difficult for users to trust the information on these platforms. Most research studies focus on fake news detection in the English language, and only a limited number of studies deal with fake news in resource-poor languages such as Urdu. This article proposes a globally weighted term selection approach named normalized effect size (NES) to select highly discriminative features for Urdu fake news classification. The proposed model is based on the traditional inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting measure. TF-IDF transforms the textual data into a weighted term-document matrix and is usually prone to the curse of dimensionality. Our novel statistical model filters the most discriminative terms to reduce the data's dimensionality and improve classification accuracy. We compare the proposed approach with the seven well-known feature selection and ranking techniques, namely normalized difference measure (NDM), binormal separation (BNS), odds ratio (OR), GINI, distinguished feature selector (DFS), information gain (IG), and Chi square (Chi). Our ensemble-based approach achieves high performance on two benchmark datasets, BET and UFN, achieving an accuracy of 88% and 90%, respectively.

AB Most reinforcement learning methods describe sequential decision-making as a Markov decision process where the effect of action is only decided by the current state. But this is reasonable only if the state is correctly defined and the state information is sufficiently observed. Thus the learning efficiency of reinforcement learning methods based on Markov decision process is limited when the state information is insufficient. Partially observable Markov decision process and history-based decision process are respectively proposed to describe sequential decision-making with insufficient state information. However, these two processes are easy to ignore the important information from the current observed state. Therefore, the learning efficiency of reinforcement learning methods based on these two processes is also limited when the state information is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a multi-view reinforcement learning method to solve this problem. The motivation is that the interaction information between the agent and its environment should be considered from the views of history, present, and future to overcome the insufficiency of state information. Based on these views, we construct a multi-view decision process to describe sequential decision-making with insufficient state information. A multi-view reinforcement learning method is proposed by combining the multi-view decision process and the actor-critic framework. In the proposed method, multi-view clustering is performed to ensure that each type of sample can be sufficiently exploited. Experiments illustrate that the proposed method is more effective than the compared state-of-the-arts. The source code can be downloaded from https://github.com/jamieliuestc/MVRL.

AB Feature selection is an important strategy for knowledge reduction in rough set. Interval-valued data, as an extension of single values, can better express uncertain information from the perspective of uncertainty measure. However, for applications in the real world, feature values in interval-valued data vary with time evolving. For dynamic interval-valued data, it is time-consuming to employ existing approaches to choose the feature subset because they need to recalculate the interval-valued data from scratch when feature values vary. Motived by this, we research the incremental methods of feature selection in dynamic interval-valued data environment, which can select new feature subset according to previous results. At first, the incremental updatings of theta-conditional entropy are proposed, which measures the significance of candidate features along with the change of feature values of a single object and multiple objects, respetively. On this basis, aiming at dynamic interval-valued data, the homologous incremental feature selection algorithms are put forward. Finally, by comparing the results of feature subset selection between incremental algorithm and non-incremental algorithm on public data sets, it can be concluded that the proposed two incremental algorithms are more efficient and effective, especially, as multiple objects change feature values, two incremental algorithms proposed in this paper have achieved satisfactory results in computing time.

AB The synchronization of multi-weighted delayed coupled Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (CCGNNs) is considered in this paper. On the one hand, by designing a general controller and an aperiodically intermittent controller, respectively, several adequate conditions for reaching finite-time synchronization of the considered network are obtained, and the settling time is given. On the other hand, the pinning synchronization of the delayed CCGNNs with multiple weights is considered, and some corresponding criteria of pinning synchronization are derived by a general adaptive control scheme and an adaptive aperiodically intermittent control scheme, respectively. Finally, two illustrative examples including numerical simulations are presented to show the correctness of our results.

ID GROUP-HOUSED PIGS; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; MIXTURE
AB Computer vision methods for non-contact detection of herd pigs could help detect early disease and reduce mortality rates by analyzing pig behavior. Due to the limitation of breeding space and cost, the unit breeding area is relatively dense, making it difficult to detect all pigs for a long time without interruption. In order to improve the detection performance, this paper proposes an end-to-end efficient and accurate herd pig detection framework based on YOLOv7 target detection model, which is named Ghost-YOLOv7-SIoU. In this framework, the feature extraction backbone network consists of a series of directly connected efficient layer aggregation networks (ELAN) and downsampling modules. The neck network contains a feature pyramid network and path aggregation network. Ghost convolution is adopted to replace the 3 x 3 standard convolution of the ELAN module in backbone network and the scaled-up ELAN module in neck network to obtain rich features while reducing the parameter number and computational effort. Furthermore, to speed up the model convergence and improve the model robustness and accuracy, SIoU loss is used for bounding box regression in the training stage. On the VOC2012 dataset, the number of parameters and floating-point operations decreased by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to YOLOv7, with comparable detection accuracy. Additionally, the number of parameters and floating-point operations decreased by 13.7% and 16.1% on our pig dataset. Ghost-YOLOv7-SIoU is superior to YOLOV4-CSP and YOLOR-CSP in accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the efficiency of model detection while ensuring detection accuracy.

AB To ensure the steady navigation for robot stable controls are one of the basic requirements. Control values selection is highly environment dependent. To ensure reusability of control parameter, system needs to generalize over the environment. Adding adaptability in robots to perform effectively in the environments with no prior knowledge reinforcement leaning is a promising approach. However, tuning hyper parameters and attaining correlation between state space and reward function to train a stable reinforcement learning agent is a challenge. This paper is focused, to design a continuous reward function to minimize the sparsity and stabilizes the policy convergence, to attain control generalization for differential drive robot. To achieve that, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient is implemented on PyBullet Racecar model in Open-AIGym environment. System was trained to achieve smart primitive control policy, moving forward in the direction of goal by maintaining an appropriate distance from walls to avoid collision. Resulting policy was tested on unseen environments including dynamic goal environment, boundary free environment and continuous path environment on which it outperformed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient.

ID REGRESSION
AB The present bottleneck in biosimilar bioprocess development has become evaluation of analytical results, due to recent advances in analytics, such as automated sample preparation and development of high-throughput methods. Currently automated chromatogram integration and annotation is only efficient for simple chromatograms. In an ever more competitive field of biosimilars, this represents a serious drawback because chromatographic analytical methods that provide some of the most valuable physicochemical quality attributes of the product also require careful chromatogram integration and annotation. This work focuses on the glycan mapping analytical method as utilized in development of monoclonal antibody biosimilars, evaluating more than 2000 chromatograms spanning the life cycle of multiple biosimilar development projects. It proposes a modified workflow by implementing automatic machine learning algorithms to determine the proportion of specific relevant glycan species in a sample directly from the chromatogram. Data preparation and analysis is performed using a pipeline approach. Pipeline is a modular design of data processing where signal "travels" through various active modules in a series. Each module performs a specific function or transformation on the signal and propagates the transformed signal to the next module. The pipeline is designed in a way that modules can be independently improved and exchanged. Module functions currently implemented are chromatogram resampling by spline interpolation, baseline removal by asymmetric least squares, peak alignment using parametric time warping, and quantification of the relative proportion of a glycan species using partial least squares regression. Hyper-parameters of the pipeline are then optimized using the Nelder-Mead method. The approach stands out for its ability to accommodate a broad landscape of samples, covering multiple different proteins in different stages of biosimilar development, analyzed using different adaptations of the glycan map analytical method. The pipeline presents an intuitive, flexible, and creatively simple method design capable of providing reliable results for a wide range of glycan species essential for biosimilar development. It enables transparent, faster, and less subjective evaluation of analytic raw data (from sample to result). Furthermore, our automated approach maintained an accuracy comparable with manual integration thus demonstrating its readiness for implementation in the conservative and highly regulated environment. The presented methodology reduces the cost and time of biosimilar development and should be applicable for any chromatogram-based analytical method.
   The current analytical workflow for biosimilar development is modified by implementing automatic machine learning algorithms that can determine the proportion of specific relevant glycan species in a sample directly from the chromatogram.

AB Manufacturing requires various machining processes. Nowadays, machining implies advanced technologies in order to meet more exacting process performance criteria. This paper addresses the optimization of four conventional and nonconventional machining processes: drilling, grinding, water jet machining (WJM), and wire electrical discharge machining (EDM). The input process parameters are: cutting speed, feed rate, cutting environment, depth of cut, grit size, water jet pressure, diameter of water jet nozzle, traverse rate of the nozzle, stand-off-distance, ignition pulse current, pulse-off time, pulse duration, servo reference mean voltage, servo speed variation, wire speed, wire tension, and injection pressure. The multi-objective EDM optimization problem is converted to a single-objective problem using the weighted-sum method. Two nature-inspired algorithms of artificial intelligence (AI) are implemented for solving these problems, namely the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the flower pollination algorithm (FPA). Penalty functions are introduced to handle the constraints and to enhance the algorithms for better results. The machining outputs, required number of function evaluations, CPU time, and standard deviations are the performance metrics. The results obtained are compared and show better performance than that already documented in the literature.

AB As a nature-inspired metaheuristic method, the firefly algorithm (FA) arises more attentions in academic and engineering fields. However, too much attraction in FA's global attraction model leads to low computational efficiency, and the stochastic model with fixed randomization parameter is hard to balance the exploitation and exploration of the algorithm. Thus, FA still needs improvement to deal with complex engineering problems. An integrated firefly algorithm (IFA) that combines two novel attractive models with a new stochastic model is proposed to improve the standard FA. Firstly, the attractive model and stochastic model of standard FA are investigated through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. And the factors that affect the computational efficiency and accuracy of FA are revealed. Based on the analysis results, two new fitness-based update formulas for attractiveness parameter are constructed to avoid the invalidation. The proposed virtual attractive model and global best attractive model can reduce the computation complexity and enhance the exploitation ability. Moreover, an adaptive strategy is presented for the stochastic model to achieve a better balance between exploitation and exploration. The nonlinearly decreased model for the update of parameter alpha can adjust the population diversity through the iteration and ensure the convergence. Additionally, an adaptive penalty function method is developed to handle the constraints effectively. Then, the initial parameters are tested, and the best initial parameters corresponding to the optimal performance of IFA are obtained. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by CEC2015 hybrid composition and a set of classical functions. The numerical experimental results show that the proposed techniques can enhance the solution accuracy and accelerate the convergence speed. Finally, IFA and other metaheuristic algorithms are applied to solve five engineering design optimization problems with mixed variables and multiple constraint conditions. The results indicate that IFA with adaptive penalty function needs fewer fitness evaluations and costs less computational time to obtain the optimal solutions. Furthermore, it exhibits better accuracy and robustness than other algorithms.

AB This paper discusses the importance of feature extraction and structure similarity measurement in the analysis of complex networks. Social networks, biological systems, and transportation networks are just a few examples of the many phenomena that have been modeled using complex networks. However, analyzing these networks can be challenging due to their large size and complexity. Feature extraction techniques can help to simplify the network by identifying key nodes or substructures. Structure similarity measurement techniques can be used to compare different networks and identify similarities and differences between them. Previous research has suggested that real-world complex networks are influenced by multiplex features and either local or global features. However, the interaction between these characteristics is not well understood. The proposed approach outperforms other graph similarity methods on publicly available datasets, with accurate estimations of overall complex network structures. Specifically, the approach based on cosine similarity outperforms as compared to existing methods. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering various graph features-local and global features and their interactions in the analysis of complex networks.

However, it is pretty challenging to predict PV power in short-term under precious future meteorological information absence conditions. To address this problem, this study proposes the hybrid Contrastive Learning and Temporal Convolutional Network (CL-TCN), and this forecasting approach consists of two parts, including model training and adaptive processes of forecasting models. In the model training stage, this forecasting method firstly trains 18 TCN models for 18 time points from 9:00 a.m. to 17:30 p.m. These TCN models are trained by only using historical PV power data samples, and each model is used to predict the next half-hour power output. The adaptive process of models means that, in a practical forecasting stage, PV power samples from historical data are firstly evaluated and scored by a CL based data scoring mechanism to search for the most similar data samples to current measured samples. Then these similar samples are further applied to training a single above-mentioned well-trained TCN model to improve its performance in forecasting the next half-hour PV power. The experimental results tested at the time resolution of 30 min demonstrate that the proposed approach has superior performance in forecasting accuracy not only in smooth PV power samples but also in fluctuating PV power samples. Moreover, the proposed CL based data scoring mechanism can filter useless data samples effectively accelerating the forecasting process.

TI HQ-I2IT: Redesign the optimization scheme to improve image quality in

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article; Early Access
DE computer animation; computer vision; image processing
AB The image-to-image translation (I2IT) task aims to transform images from the source domain into the specified target domain. State-of-the-art CycleGAN-based translation algorithms typically use cycle consistency loss and latent regression loss to constrain translation. In this work, it is demonstrated that the model parameters constrained by the cycle consistency loss and the latent regression loss are equivalent to optimizing the medians of the data distribution and the generative distribution. In addition, there is a style bias in the translation. This bias interacts between the generator and the style encoder and visually exhibits translation errors, e.g. the style of the generated image is not equal to the style of the reference image. To address these issues, a new I2IT model termed high-quality-I2IT (HQ-I2IT) is proposed. The optimization scheme is redesigned to prevent the model from optimizing the median of the data distribution. In addition, by separating the optimization of the generator and the latent code estimator, the redesigned model avoids error interactions and gradually corrects errors during training, thereby avoiding learning the median of the generated distribution. The experimental results demonstrate that the visual quality of the images produced by HQ-I2IT is significantly improved without changing the generator structure, especially when guided by the reference images. Specifically, the Frechet inception distance on the AFHQ and CelebA-HQ datasets are reduced from 19.8 to 10.2 and from 23.8 to 17.0, respectively.
   In this work, it is demonstrated that the cycle consistency loss and latent regression loss in CycleGAN-based image translation models can be detrimental to image quality. The optimization scheme of CycleGAN-based image translation systems is redesigned and a new translation model named HQ-I2IT is proposed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve image quality and translation accuracy.image

AB With the aging of society, there has been an increasing amount of research on elderly-assisted companion robots. However, many existing methods used in research insufficiently consider the physiological characteristics of the elderly or rely on a single mode of interaction, leading to inaccurate understanding of elderly individuals' intents. In this paper, we design a multimodal intent understanding and interaction system for elderly-assisted companionship. The system presents the following main innovations: (1) Proposing a semantic-based multimodal fusion algorithm (MSFA) to integrate the semantic layers of gesture and speech, addressing the heterogeneity and asynchrony issues between the two modalities. (2) Assisting elderly individuals in completing daily tasks through the human-computer cooperative interaction control algorithm (HCC). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal fusion algorithm achieves effective intent recognition and combines natural human-machine interaction with intent understanding. This not only accurately captures users' interaction intents and assists in completing interactive tasks but also reduces users' mental and cognitive load, achieving a more desirable interaction effect. Additionally, the subjective evaluation analysis by users further verifies the effectiveness of the system.

AB With the continuous development of the market economy, the professional degree of the logistics industry is constantly improving, while the logistics distribution industry is also developing rapidly. The logistics distribution of the cold chain supply chain involves multiple distribution points, and the distance and time relationship between the distribution points are often not fully considered in the route planning, resulting in low distribution efficiency. The hierarchical algorithm model based on machine vision can solve the above problems to a certain extent. This paper takes two cold chain supply chain enterprises as the main research body, analyzes how to choose two kinds of COD and CCD sensors using machine vision, and the number of distribution vehicle scheduling. The simulation experiment was performed and at the end of the article it is summarized and discussed. According to the data sample, the two enterprises have the largest number of people satisfied with the supply chain logistics and distribution vehicle scheduling, but the number of people dissatisfied with enterprise A is 6 and 12% of the total. The number of people dissatisfied with enterprise B is 16 and 32% of the total number, It can be seen that although the number of people satisfied with the two enterprises is large, the number of people dissatisfied with enterprise B far exceeds that of enterprise A. At the same time, with the continuous research of supply chain logistics distribution vehicle scheduling, the research on machine vision is also facing new opportunities and challenges.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) based on deep learning provides a positive performance for generative dialogue system, and the transformer model is a new boost in NLP after the advent of word vectors. In this paper, a Chinese generative dialogue system based on transformer is designed, which only uses a multi-layer transformer decoder to build the system and uses the design of an incomplete mask to realize one-way language generation. That is, questions can perceive context information in both directions, while reply sentences can only output one-way autoregressive. The above system improvements make the one-way generation of dialogue tasks more logical and reasonable, and the performance is better than the traditional dialogue system scheme. In consideration of the long-distance information weakness of absolute position coding, we put forward the improvement of relative position coding in theory, and verify it in subsequent experiments. In the transformer module, the calculation formula of self-attention is modified, and the relative position information is added to replace the absolute position coding of the position embedding layer. The performance of the modified model in BLEU, embedding average, grammatical and semantic coherence is ideal, to enhance long-distance attention.

AB State-of-the-art Large Language Models have recently exhibited extraordinary linguistic abilities which have surprisingly extended to reasoning. However, responses that are unreliable, false, or invented are still a frequent issue. It has been argued that scaling up strategies, as in increasing model size or hardware power, might not be enough to resolve the issue. Recent research has implemented Type 2 strategies (such as Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought), as strategies that mimic Type 2 reasoning, from Dual Process Theory, to interact with Large Language Models for improved results. The current paper reviews these strategies in light of the Predicting and Reflecting Framework for understanding Dual Process Theory and suggests what Psychology, drawing from research in executive functions, thinking disposition and creativity, can further contribute to possible implementations that address hallucination and reliability issues.

AB Existing deep learning techniques for image fusion either learn image mapping (LIM) directly, which renders them ineffective at preserving details due to the equal consideration to each pixel, or learn detail mapping (LDM), which only attains a limited level of performance because only details are used for reasoning. The recent lossless invertible network (INN) has demonstrated its detail-preserving ability. However, the direct applicability of INN to the image fusion task is limited by the volume-preserving constraint. Additionally, there is the lack of a consistent detail-preserving image fusion framework to produce satisfactory outcomes. To this aim, we propose a general paradigm for image fusion based on a novel conditional INN (named DCINN). The DCINN paradigm has three core components: a decomposing module that converts image mapping to detail mapping; an auxiliary network (ANet) that extracts auxiliary features directly from source images; and a conditional INN (CINN) that learns the detail mapping based on auxiliary features. The novel design benefits from the advantages of INN, LIM, and LDM approaches while avoiding their disadvantages. Particularly, using INN to LDM can easily meet the volume-preserving constraint while still preserving details. Moreover, since auxiliary features serve as conditional features, the ANet allows for the use of more than just details for reasoning without compromising detail mapping. Extensive experiments on three benchmark fusion problems, i.e., pansharpening, hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion, and infrared and visible image fusion, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with recent state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhappylife/DCINN.

AB Robust monocular depth estimation (MDE) aims at learning a unified model that works across diverse real-world scenes, which is an important and active topic in computer vision. In this paper, we present Megatron_RVC, our winning solution for the monocular depth challenge in the Robust Vision Challenge (RVC) 2022, where we tackle the challenging problem from three perspectives: network architecture, training strategy and dataset. In particular, we made three contributions towards robust MDE: (1) we built a neural network with high capacity to enable flexible and accurate monocular depth predictions, which contains dedicated components to provide content-aware embeddings and to improve the richness of the details; (2) we proposed a novel mixing training strategy to handle real-world images with different aspect ratios, resolutions and apply tailored loss functions based on the properties of their depth maps; (3) to train a unified network model that covers diverse real-world scenes, we used over 1 million images from different datasets. As of 3rd October 2022, our unified model ranked consistently first across three benchmarks (KITTI, MPI Sintel, and VIPER) among all participants.

AB Telematics will be one of the critical technologies in the future intelligent transportation system and establish communication between vehicles and vehicles, vehicles and networks, and vehicles and people. Thus, vehicles can sense mobile environments and make rational driving decisions. Therefore, the safety and efficiency of traffic flow would be enhanced. However, due to the unknown nature and higher complexity of the connected network environments of vehicles, the utilization of conventional optimization theory fails to generate satisfying results. To address the problem, this article proposes a methodology for collaborative transmission for communication regarding the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the help of advanced computational algorithms. The article employs a multi-intelligence advanced computational algorithm to construct a collaborative communication transmission mechanism in the telematics communication system model. The proposed algorithm fully considers the vehicle mobility and quality-of-service (QoS) of telematics services within the network slice. It adjusts the slice's radio resource allocation and parameter settings on an expanded time scale to improve the QoS of telematics services and increase the system's long-term revenue. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has a more significant performance improvement than conventional algorithms using telematics information transmission. For example, when the same load conditions are under consideration, the total capacity of the vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) link optimized by the proposed algorithm is still higher than that of the other three baseline strategies.

AB Currently, the calibration of electric energy meters often involves manual meter reading, dismantling inspection, or regular sampling inspection conducted by professionals. To improve work efficiency and verification accuracy, this research integrates machine learning into the scheme of online verification and management of gateway meter flow in the power system. The approach begins by applying the Faster Region Convolutional Neural Network (Faster-RCNN) model and the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) model to the recognition system for dial readings. Then, the collected measurement data is pre-processed, excluding data collected under light load conditions. Next, an estimation error model and a solution equation for the electricity meter are established based on the pre-processed data. The operation error of the electricity meter is estimated, and the estimation accuracy is verified using the limited memory recursive least squares algorithm (LMRLSA). Furthermore, business assistant decision-making is carried out by combining the remote verification results with the estimation outcomes. The proposed dial reading recognition system is tested using 528 images of meter readings, achieving an accuracy of 98.49%. In addition, the influence of various parameters on the error results of the electricity meter is also explored. The results demonstrate that a memory length ranging from 600 to 1,200 and a line loss error of less than 5% yield the most suitable accuracy for estimating the electricity meter error. Meanwhile, it is advisable to remove measurement data collected under light load to avoid unnecessary checks. The experiments manifest that the proposed algorithm can properly eliminate the influence of old measurement data on the error parameter estimation, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the estimation. The adjustment of the memory length ensures real-time performance in estimating meter errors and enables online monitoring. This research has certain reference significance for achieving the online verification and management of gateway meter flow in the power system.

It is observed that the set I-delta(L) of all delta-ideals of a p-algebra L is a bounded lattice, and the class I-P(delta)(L) of all principal delta-ideals forms a bounded sublattice of I-delta(L) and a Boolean algebra on its own. A characterization of a delta-ideal in terms of principal delta-ideals, in p-algebras, is given. Also, the concept of comaximality of delta-ideals is discussed in p-algebras. After that, a number of properties of the homomorphic image of delta-ideals are considered.

AB Ground reaction force and moment (GRF&M) measurements are vital for biomechanical analysis and significantly impact the clinical domain for early abnormality detection for different neurodegenerative diseases. Force platforms have become the de facto standard for measuring GRF&M signals in recent years. Although the signal quality achieved from these devices is unparalleled, they are expensive and require laboratory setup, making them unsuitable for many clinical applications. For these reasons, predicting GRF&M from cheaper and more feasible alternatives has become a topic of interest. Several works have been done on predicting GRF&M from kinematic data captured from the subject's body with the help of motion capture cameras. The problem with these solutions is that they rely on markers placed on the whole body to capture the movements, which can be very infeasible in many practical scenarios. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to predict 3D GRF&M from only 5 markers placed on the shoe. The proposed network "Attention Guided MultiResUNet" can predict the force and moment signals accurately and reliably compared to the techniques relying on full-body markers. The proposed deep learning model is tested on two publicly available datasets containing data from 66 healthy subjects to validate the approach. The framework has achieved an average correlation coefficient of 0.96 for 3D ground reaction force prediction and 0.86 for 3D ground reaction momentum prediction in cross-dataset validation. The framework can provide a cheaper and more feasible alternative for predicting GRF&M in many practical applications.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Online streaming feature selection; Pareto dominance; High-dimensional
   data; Multi-objective optimization
AB Online streaming feature selection (OSFS) methods are used to dynamically update the feature space as well as remove irrelevant and redundant features from the data. Since most Big Data in real-world applications are generated in the form of data streams, effective methods should be developed in this area. Further, methods with low computational complexity are required to make online decisions. In this paper, the OSFS process is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the concept of Pareto dominance has been applied to find the optimal subset of features in OSFS. When a new feature arrives, it is evaluated in the multi-objective space. The non-dominated features are the optimal subset for each timestamp. We proposed an efficient and effective method which enhances the classification accuracy in OSFS by minimizing the number of features within a short time. In addition, the proposed method is insensitive to the feature streams. Experiments are conducted using two classifiers and seven OSFS methods, including OSFSMI, K-OFSD, OFS-A3M, OFS-Density, Alpha-Investing, SAOLA, and OFSS-FI.

AB Human resource management is the process of making a company's human resources decisions. In general, these decisions include hiring, firing, training, and developing people according to their positions and the needs of the organization. It includes a variety of policies and strategies designed to recognize the contribution that people make to an organization. The core goal of this article is to depict a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methodology for selecting employees. The purpose behind selecting employees is to identify and hire individuals who possess the required skills, qualifications, and attributes that align with the organization's goals and job requirements. To reflect an inadequate assessment, ambiguity, and anxiety in making choices, the intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft expert set is an extension of the intuitionistic fuzzy soft expert and hypersoft sets. It is a novel approach to decisions and intelligent computing in the face of uncertainty. The intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft expert set has a better ability to handle ambiguous and unclear data. In the research that follows, the ideas and characteristics of the correlation coefficient and the weighted correlation coefficient of the intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft expert sets are proposed. Under the aegis of intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft expert sets, a TOPSIS based on correlation coefficients and weighted correlation coefficients is introduced. Aside from that, we also covered aggregation operators, including intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft weighted geometric operators. The decision-making process is suggested in an intuitionistic fuzzy hypersoft expert environment to resolve uncertain and ambiguous information, relying on the well-established TOPSIS approach and aggregation operators. An illustration of decision-making challenges shows how the suggested algorithm can be used. The efficacy of this strategy is lastly demonstrated by comparing its benefits, effectiveness, flexibility, and numerous current studies.

AB To effectively estimate traffic patterns, spatial-temporal information must consider the complex spatial connections on road networks and time-dependent traffic information. Although deep learning models can comprehend the complex Spatio-temporal correlations in traffic data, much research has been done recently on creating these models for traffic prediction. Aside from graph neural networks (GNNs), most contemporary approaches have created spatial-only and temporal-only units to learn the spatial and temporal characteristics separately. The physical network topology is used to explain the traffic graph convolution. Therefore, this paper proposed an Integrated Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network for traffic prediction (ISTGCN), which learns the accumulation of temporal and spatial properties by transmitting data from various timestamps junctions. The aim is to propose a solution without using separate Spatio-temporal modules. Experiments show that the proposed ISTGCN model effectively captures spatial-temporal information and improves traffic prediction accuracy with the state-of-the-art model. The proposed model compared on four windows, prediction after 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes. ISTGCN improved the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE by 20%, 6.11% and 18%, respectively of USTGCN, while predicting after 60 minutes. The results also show that the training time is substantially reduced due to the smaller number of training parameters.

DE Ensemble method; Deep learning; Deep forest model; Classification tasks
AB The deep forest model, a random forest (RF) ensemble approach and an alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN), has performance highly competitive to DNN in many classification tasks. However, deep forest model may encounter overfitting and characteristic dispersion issues as processing small-scale, class-imbalance or high-dimension data. Therefore, this paper proposes a Weighted Cascade Deep Forest framework, called WCDForest. In WCDForest, an equal multi-grained scanning module is used to scan each feature equally. Meanwhile, this framework adopts a class vector weighting module to emphasis the performance of each forest and each sliding window by weight. Furthermore, this study proposes a feature enhancement module to reduce the information loss in the first few cascade layers to improve the classification accuracy. Subsequently, systematic comparison experiments on 18 widely used public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art model. In particular, WCDForest improves the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score by an average of 5.47%,7.04%,8.23% and 8.94%,respectively.

AB This research was aimed to analyse the application value of magnetic resonance imaging based on Fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm in neonatal hypoglycemia brain injury (HBI), and explore the risk factors related to the occurrence of brain injury in children, to pro-vide guidance for clinical diagnosis and treatment. 114 children with hypoglycemia were divided into brain injury group (58 cases) and no brain injury group (56 cases) according to whether they had brain injury or not. The MRI image signal performance, general data, average minimum blood glucose value, duration of hypoglycemia, first feeding time, age of onset of hypoglycemia, and algorithm segmentation performance of the two groups of patients were observed and compared. Furthermore, the Logistic factor analysis was carried out to summarize the MRI characteristics and related risk factors of neonatal hypoglycemic brain injury. The results showed that the average minimum blood glucose (1.09 +/- 0.53 mmoL/L) in the brain injury group was lower than that in the non-brain injury group (1.75 +/- 0.49 mmoL/L), and the duration of hypoglycemia (43.1 +/- 21.07 h) was higher than that in the non-brain injury group (13.79 +/- 6.81 h), p < 0.05. The first feeding time and age of hypoglycemia in the brain injury group were higher than those in the non-brain injury group, showing a difference with p < 0.05. In the brain injury group, all 58 cases showed high DWI (diffusion weighted imaging) signal at the damaged site at the early stage of MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and 23 cases (39.66%) were involved in parieto-occipital lobe. Image segmentation coefficient of Vpc increased significantly under FCM clustering algorithm (p < 0.05). Late first feeding time, low blood sugar level, and long duration were high risk factors for hypo-glycemic brain injury. In conclusion, MRI images based on FCM clustering algorithm had higher image quality. Late first feeding time, low blood sugar level, and long duration of hypoglycemia were high risk factors for hypoglycemic brain injury.

AB In this study, we address the challenge of accurately solving physical problems involving complex partial differential equations using deep learning methods. Traditional approaches typically employ uniformly sampled points from the entire domain as training data. In practical PDE problems, achieving uniform precision across the entire domain is often unnecessary. Instead, it is more advantageous to employ random sampling during neural network training, provided that areas demanding precision can be identified and appropriately refined, akin to the concept of mesh refinement in classical numerical methods. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method based on the partition of unity approach. Our method introduces an approximation of the integral in the loss function, enabling localized calculation of the loss function within each subdomain. This innovative approach allows us to focus on areas of the domain that require higher precision while maintaining a fully automated process for selecting random samples. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive testing on various physical problems, including Poisson, heat, and wave equations representing elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic problems, respectively. Additionally, we consider Burgers' equation as a nonlinear example. Through benchmarking against the standard Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and Deep Galerkin Method (DGM), we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms these existing approaches, producing superior results. This approach offers researchers and practitioners the opportunity to significantly improve the accuracy of deep learning models when tackling complex physical problems.

DE computer vision; image resolution; remote sensing
AB As satellite imagery technology advances, remote sensing plays an increasingly prominent role in modern society. Nevertheless, the limitations of existing imaging sensors and complex atmospheric conditions constrain the quality of raw remote sensing data, posing challenges for interpretation and noise reduction. Super-resolution technology focuses on enhancing low-quality, low-resolution remote sensing images. In this study, we introduce a method that utilizes a high-order degradation model to generate low-resolution remote sensing images. We employ a Generative Adversarial Network with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM-GAN) to enhance these images, reducing noise interference and improving texture and feature display. Our approach outperforms other methods on the UCMerced-LandUse, WHU-RS19, and AID datasets. Specifically, it raises SSIM index scores to 0.9443, 0.8928, and 0.8633, respectively, exceeding baselines by 1.31%, 0.19%, and 1.30%. The MOS index also improves to 3.98, 3.96, and 3.83, respectively, representing a 2.31%, 8.20%, and 2.96% gain over the baseline. Our reconstruction produces superior results, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.
   In this paper, a method is proposed that adopts a high-order degradation model to generate low-resolution remote sensing images. Then a generative adversarial network on convolutional block attention module is built based on a convolutional block attention module to achieve super-resolution of remote sensing images while reducing the influence of noise factors and enhancing the texture and feature display degree of remote sensing images.image

AB In this study, we developed a simple technique for effective parameter estimation and prediction of the quantitative structure activity relationship studies using a two-step procedure. The first step is to choose the important molecular descriptors using the random forest regression, and the second step is to optimally predict the biological activity of the selected chemical compounds using the following estimators: ridge regression, jackknife ridge, Liu regression, jackknife Liu, Kibria-Lukman, and jackknife Kibria-Lukman. We conducted a simulation study and a real-life analysis with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) data with 2540 descriptors after preprocessing. The optimal prediction is determined using the cross-validation error. The estimator with minimum cross-validation error is considered best. It is obvious that performing jackknife estimation after random forest selection is preferred.

TI Neural scaling of deep chemical models
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
AB Massive scale, in terms of both data availability and computation, enables important breakthroughs in key application areas of deep learning such as natural language processing and computer vision. There is emerging evidence that scale may be a key ingredient in scientific deep learning, but the importance of physical priors in scientific domains makes the strategies and benefits of scaling uncertain. Here we investigate neural-scaling behaviour in large chemical models by varying model and dataset sizes over many orders of magnitude, studying models with over one billion parameters, pre-trained on datasets of up to ten million datapoints. We consider large language models for generative chemistry and graph neural networks for machine-learned interatomic potentials. We investigate the interplay between physical priors and scale and discover empirical neural-scaling relations for language models in chemistry with a scaling exponent of 0.17 for the largest dataset size considered, and a scaling exponent of 0.26 for equivariant graph neural network interatomic potentials.

AB Accurate iris centre localization is crucial in many computer vision and facial biometric applications such as gaze estimation, human-computer interaction, iris recognition, and liveness detection. However, it is challenging in an uncontrolled environment due to variations like pose, scale, rotation, specular reflection, and image quality. Therefore, a cascaded deep learning framework for iris centre localization in facial images is proposed that is robust to the abovementioned variations. The proposed approach consists of (i) YOLOv3 for eye detection, (ii) UNet for iris segmentation, and (iii) statistical modelling for iris centre localization. The eyes are first detected using the YOLOv3, and subsequently, iris segmentation is performed within the detected eyes using the UNet. Following iris segmentation, statistical modelling is employed to enhance the localization accuracy of the iris centre. Experiments were performed on benchmark databases, resulting in a standardized error measure SED of 3.405 pixels for BioID and 3.259 pixels for GI4E databases. In addition, the robustness of the proposed eye detection model was further evaluated on the Yale B for illumination variations and the CAS-PEAL for pose variations.

AB Classifying and quantifying small molecules on-site with a rapid and cost-effective operation are essential for pharmaceutical manufacturing, healthcare, hazardous risk control, and other applications. However, traditional molecular detection and identification methods like chromatography often involve expensive and bulky equipment and are required to be operated by trained professionals, which severely hinders the further development of small molecule-based applications. Herein, a novel molecular detection platform is introduced by imaging a spatial gradient metasurface consisting of millions of different unique atoms and following with deep learning modeling to classify and quantify small molecules from mixed solutions accurately. The metasurface has a circular gradient geometry, which changes its transmittance intensity pattern based on the surrounding molecules under narrow-band illumination. A convolutional neural network trained on the monochromatic images of the metasurface is employed. The results demonstrate a recognition rate of 96.88% for classification and a mean absolute error of 16.23% for quantification. This novel platform enables label-free, sensitive, and rapid molecular classification and quantification, which opens a new avenue for small molecule classification and quantification and enables possibilities for real-time, on-site, and label-free applications, including environmental monitoring, drug screening, and early diagnosis.

However, it remains challenging to grasp objects reliably while fully submerging under a highly pressurized aquatic environment with little visible light, mainly due to the fluidic interference on the tactile mechanics between the finger and object surfaces. This study investigates the transferability of grasping knowledge from on-land to underwater via a vision-based soft robotic finger that learns 6D forces and torques (FT) using a supervised variational autoencoder (SVAE). A high-framerate camera captures the whole-body deformations while a soft robotic finger interacts with physical objects on-land and underwater. Results show that the trained SVAE model learns a series of latent representations of the soft mechanics transferable from land to water, presenting a superior adaptation to the changing environments against commercial FT sensors. Soft, delicate, and reactive grasping enabled by tactile intelligence enhances the gripper's underwater interaction with improved reliability and robustness at a much-reduced cost, paving the path for learning-based intelligent grasping to support fundamental scientific discoveries in environmental and ocean research.
   A soft robotic finger with in-finger vision capable of transferring grasping knowledge from on-land to underwater by learning 6D forces and torques using a supervised variational autoencoder is presented, resulting in a learning-based approach to introduce tactile intelligence for soft, delicate, and reactive grasping underwater, making it a promising solution that supports scientific discoveries in interdisciplinary research.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Monkeypox virus is one of the major causes of both smallpox and cowpox infection in our society. It is typically located next to tropical rain forests in remote villages in Central and West Africa. The disease is brought on by the monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus and the Poxviridae family. For analysis and the dynamical behaviour of the monkeypox virus infection, we developed a fractional order model with the Mittag-Leffler kernel. The uniqueness, positivity, and boundedness of the model are treated with fixed point theory results. A Lyapunov function is used to construct both local and global asymptotic stability of the system for both endemic and disease-free equilibrium points. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out using the effective numerical scheme with an extended Mittag-Leffler function to demonstrate the accuracy of the suggested approaches.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) become popular choices for processing spatiotemporal input data and enabling low-power event-driven spike computation on neuromorphic processors. However, direct SNN training algorithms are not well compatible with error back-propagation process, while indirect conversion algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are usually accuracy-lossy due to various approximation errors. Both of them suffer from lower accuracies compared with their reference ANNs and need lots of time steps to achieve stable performance in deep architectures. In this article, a novel conversion framework is presented for deep SNNs with negative-spike dynamics, which takes a quantization constraint and spike compensation technique into consideration during ANN-to-SNN conversion, and a truly lossless accuracy performance with their ANN counterparts is obtained. The converted SNNs can retain full advantages of simple leaky-integrate-and-fire spiking neurons and are very suited for hardware implementation. In the experimental results, it is shown that converted spiking LeNet on MNIST/FashionMNIST and VGG-Net on CIFAR-10 dataset yield the state-of-the-art classification accuracies with quite shortened computing time steps and much fewer synaptic operations.
   A novel artificial neural network to spiking neural network (ANN-to-SNN) conversion framework is presented for high-accuracy and low-latency SNNs with negative-spike dynamics. The conversion algorithm takes a median quantization constraint and spike compensation technique into consideration and achieves a truly lossless accuracy performance. In addition, the spiking models need quite shortened computing time steps among other works and consume much fewer synaptic operations than their ANN counterparts.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Aiming at the problem that users' check-in interest preferences in social networks have complex time dependences, which leads to inaccurate point-of-interest (POI) recommendations, a location-based POI recommendation model using deep learning for social network big data is proposed. First, the original data are fed into an embedding layer of the model for dense vector representation and to obtain the user's check-in sequence (UCS) and space-time interval information. Then, the UCS and spatiotemporal interval information are sent into a bidirectional long-term memory model for detailed analysis, where the UCS and location sequence representation are updated using a self-attention mechanism. Finally, candidate POIs are compared with the user's preferences, and a POI sequence with three consecutive recommended locations is generated. The experimental analysis shows that the model performs best when the Huber loss function is used and the number of training iterations is set to 200. In the Foursquare dataset, Recall@20 and NDCG@20 reach 0.418 and 0.143, and in the Gowalla dataset, the corresponding values are 0.387 and 0.148.

AB This paper deals with a major challenge in cyber-security: the need to respond to ever renewed techniques used by attackers in order to avoid detection based on analysing static features of malware. These constantly renewed techniques consist of various changes in file geometry, entropy a.s.o. As a consequence, static malware features sets describe less and less accurately the malicious files; hence, the performance of machine learning models in detecting new variants of the same malware family may be severely impaired. The paper focuses on a promising approach to this detection challenge: defining file features based on OS (operating system) API (Application Program Interface) calls sequences. We explore in detail the detection potential of such features, since, in order to act maliciously, these features are highly unlikely to be hidden. We studied several tens of thousands of such features, a modest-sized subset of which were subsequently fed to several machine learning models. The database used for training and testing consists of 1.5 million files, including malicious files from the polymorphic families Emotet and Trickbot. Using this database, nearly 4,000 pairings (classifier, feature selection algorithm) were trained / tested. Our experimental results show that the API (Application Program Interface) calls-oriented feature mining process is well suited for detecting polymorphic malware. A comparative discussion of the detection results of the various models is presented; depending on the target optimisation criterion (detection rate / false positive rate / saving resources), three of the 4,000 classification models turn out to be best suited for real-world applications: Random Forrest, Legacy Neural Networks and Decision Tree.

AB The evolution of the cumulative number of infections, and the duration of Covid-19 outbreaks, are modeled and predicted, through a novel curve fitting approach overcoming the limitations of existing models, which on one hand focus on short-term forecasts, and on the other hand fail in estimating the duration of epidemic waves. The ingenuity of the CovidCurve model lies in the precise parameter estimation from the cumulative growth of infected individuals in the logarithmic scale. This approach enables the prediction of the size and duration of Covid-19 outbreaks in their beginning with minimal, macroscopic, public information, thus outperforming existing models in predictive power, speed, reliability, and simplicity. CovidCurve generates forecasts through forward extrapolation, and therefore it is able to predict the cumulative growth of confirmed Covid-19 cases throughout an epidemic wave, thus surpassing compartmental (SI, SIR, SEIR) epidemic models, timeseries analysis, and Machine Learning methods, which produce only short-term and mostly inaccurate predictions. The CovidCurve model is precise even during the exponential increase of Covid-19 cases, well before the peak of the infection rate, where existing exponential models fail, due to the inaccurate estimation of their exponent, and their failure to predict the duration of Covid-19 outbreaks. The validity and forecasting precision of the CovidCurve model are demonstrated for twelve countries, namely Greece, India, Argentina, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Israel, Romania, and Saudi Arabia

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
DE Deep learning; Seismic images; Salt body segmentation; Sparse labels
AB The salt body is one of the important structures in reservoirs, but there are still challenges in fully interpreting salt bodies from three-dimensional seismic data. In actual exploration and production operations, the characteristics of salt bodies in most three-dimensional seismic slices are not obvious, making it difficult to obtain labeled samples for salt bodies. The complex structural features of salt bodies, which are similar to background features, severely interfere with the accuracy of salt body interpretation, leading to prominent issues of multi-solution prediction. To address these problems, we treat salt body interpretation as a semantic segmentation problem of three-dimensional seismic images and propose 3D Salt-Net. We have designed a self-training paradigm based on optical flow estimation and multi-level constraints to overcome the difficulty of obtaining labeled samples for salt bodies and provide high-quality pseudo-labels. Based on this, we establish a mapping relationship between three-dimensional seismic data and three-dimensional salt body masks to ensure the spatial continuity and smoothness of salt body predictions. In addition, we have designed two plug-and-play salt body attention modules to collectively address the issues of blurred edge features of salt bodies and interference from background similarity in the prediction results. We conducted experiments on the SEAM and F3 seismic datasets, using only 3% of the labels for training, while the rest were used for validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the 3D Salt-Net method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of salt body segmentation and achieves satisfactory results.

AB Novice pilots find it difficult to operate and land unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to the complex UAV dynamics, challenges in depth perception, lack of expertise with the control interface and additional disturbances from the ground effect. Therefore we propose a shared autonomy approach to assist pilots in safely landing a UAV under conditions where depth perception is difficult and safe landing zones are limited. Our approach is comprised of two modules: a perception module that encodes information onto a compressed latent representation using two RGB-D cameras and a policy module that is trained with the reinforcement learning algorithm TD3 to discern the pilot's intent and to provide control inputs that augment the user's input to safely land the UAV. The policy module is trained in simulation using a population of simulated users. Simulated users are sampled from a parametric model with four parameters, which model a pilot's tendency to conform to the assistant, proficiency, aggressiveness and speed. We conduct a user study (n = 28) where human participants were tasked with landing a physical UAV on one of several platforms under challenging viewing conditions. The assistant, trained with only simulated user data, improved task success rate from 51.4 to 98.2% despite being unaware of the human participants' goal or the structure of the environment a priori. With the proposed assistant, regardless of prior piloting experience, participants performed with a proficiency greater than the most experienced unassisted participants.

AB Ethnic music portrays a particular group's identity, customs, history, and traditions. Its preservation and dissemination are of core importance and are crucial for upholding society's values and maintaining cultural diversity and heritage. The fame of ethnic music is diminishing daily, and to preserve its features like patterns, sequences, melody, lyrics, and tones, Deep Learning (DL) could be utilized. These techniques comprised Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), etc. This study uses RNN techniques to extract features of ethnic music and preserve it using a data table for future generations and reference. The RNN is used, because it is best fitted for evaluating and extracting features of sequential data like music. The research study commences with the importance of ethnic music and the tools used to preserve its patterns and features. Second, it demonstrates an RNN model for extracting features of ethnic music. These features are extracted by collecting data from different sources and then defining a training dataset for validation and testing. Third, this study incorporates ethnic music education and the availability of instructions to students in schools and colleges. It collects data from students studying ethnic music and divides it into six different groups for evaluation. Finally, the proposed model is compared with its predecessor techniques and evaluated using a confusion matrix. The study found that the accuracy of the proposed method has increased by 18.67% compared to its predecessors. Similarly, the impact values' comparison shows that ethnic music and class ecosystem significantly improve students' behavior and performance.

AB The fast progress of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has significantly impacted the field of interpretation. Nonetheless, interpretation education at many Chinese schools and universities is poor quality. It strongly emphasizes theory while providing basic content, resulting in minimal pupil growth. Furthermore, existing interpretation assessment procedures must be revaluated to improve comprehensive instructional growth. Aiming at this problem, this paper systematically constructs the Automatic Interpretation Assessment System by integrating key components. Firstly, this paper explains the significance of interpretation as a cognitive bridge between AI and human cognition by emphasizing the critical relevance of interpretability in AI systems. Second, the research explores the intricacies of the internal workings of backpropagation (BP) neural networks. It explains their structural composition, signal propagation processes, and weight adjustment procedures, all of which are strategically employed to enable optimal learning within the context of the model. Third, it integrates genetic algorithms (GA) with BP neural networks in a unique way, combining the optimization capabilities of GA. This collaborative strategy employs selection, crossover, and mutation strategies to improve system performance and create a strong issue-detection feedback mechanism. Finally, utilizing interpretable AI theory, the study methodically creates the Automatic Interpretation Assessment System. This approach has a three-tier paradigm, with careful evaluation criteria including interpreter ability and skill. The requirements include bilingual competence, extra-lingual knowledge, interpreting abilities, professional excellence, and psychological quality. We comprehensively evaluated using essential parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and execution time. These results demonstrate that our proposed system excels with an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 94%, a recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 0.95, showcasing its superiority over the other systems. These findings highlight our proposed system effectiveness in reliably assessing interpretation quality and efficient processing capabilities.

ID IDENTIFICATION MODEL; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; INDICATORS; SEISMICITY
AB Earthquakes are complex phenomena that generate various forms of clusters that are highly correlated in the space and time domains. To study the dynamic properties of seismicity and estimate risk, the earthquake catalog needs to be separated into clustered and background events. Here, seismicity de-clustering is formulated as a binary many-objective optimization problem. A swarm-based many-objective chimp optimization algorithm (MaOChOA) is proposed to segregate the earthquake catalog into aftershocks and background events. The reference point-based leader selection strategy is adopted to update the solution. The proposed MaOChOA is evaluated on many objective benchmark test functions. The results are compared with existing many-objective techniques using performance metrics such as generational distance, inverse generational distance, spacing metric, hyper-volume distance, and runtime. Further, de-clustering the earthquake catalog is performed using a binary version of many-objective Chimp optimization algorithms (BMaChOA), where the sigmoid function is used in the position update mechanism. The BMaChOA is applied to 32-year historical earthquake catalogs of the Japan, California, Indonesia, and Himalayan regions. The potential of the proposed algorithm is reported by comparing it to five benchmark de-clustering techniques. The results are validated using the epicenter plot, inter-event time Vs. inter-event distance plot, cumulative plot, lambda-plot, and statistical parameters such as the m-Morisita index, coefficient of variance, average nearest neighbor, and nearest neighbor distance.

AB Ultra-reliable low-latency communications, URLLC, are designed for applications such as self-driving cars and telesurgery requiring a response in milliseconds and are very sensitive to transmission errors. To match the computational complexity of LDPC decoding algorithms to URLLC applications on IoT devices having very limited computational resources, this paper presents a new parallel and low-latency software implementation of the LDPC decoder. First, a decoding algorithm optimization and a compact data structure are proposed. Next, a parallel software implementation is performed on ARM multicore platforms in order to evaluate the latency of the proposed optimization. The synthesis results highlight a reduction in the memory size requirement by 50% and a three-time speedup in terms of processing time when compared to previous software decoder implementations. The reached decoding latency on the parallel processing platform is 150 mu s for 288 bits with a bit error ratio of 3.410-9.

DE Knowledge graph completion; Graph convolutional network; Tensor
   factorization
AB Constructed by millions of triples, knowledge graph is a commonly used structured representation of information encoding both the entities of the real-world facts and their corresponding relations. Although knowledge graph contains rich information, it is often far from complete. Knowledge graph completion algorithms are able to fill in the missing information efficiently by inferring missing or correcting wrong facts based on existing ones. However, as a kind of graph structure data, the knowledge graph includes not only the attributes of entities and relationships but also the entire graph structure information. Graph convolutional networks can learn better embedding of entities and relationships by using the connectivity structure of graphs, which is conducive to the knowledge graph complement. Although the existing methods based on graph convolutional networks can simultaneously capture the graph structure information and the attributes of entities and relationships from the knowledge graph, there is still a lack of better information decoupling and representation methods. In this article, we propose a novel Graph-Aware Tensor Factorization Convolutional Network (GATFCN) for knowledge graph completion. GATFCN combines a graph convolutional network and a tucker decomposition as the encoder and decoder. It leverages the advantages of graph convolutional network and tensor decomposition in an end-to-end manner to enrich the representation of facts. For the encoder, the GCN model is used to utilize the local information of the graph structure and graph nodes. For the decoder, tensor factorization can decode the information encoded by GCN while enriching the data representation. According to the comprehensive numerical experiments performed, GATFCN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across a number of different benchmark datasets, illustrating its effectiveness in knowledge graph completion.

DE K-means; Neural network; Interpretable; Robust; Cluster center
AB K-means is a clustering method with an interpretable mechanism. However, its clustering results are significantly affected by the location of the initial cluster centers. More importantly, for it and its improved versions, it is extremely hard to adaptively determine the number of cluster centers. In contrast, ordinary neural networks have powerful information representation ability but lack interpretability. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the use of interpretable neural networks to determine the number of cluster centers of K-means is absent. This paper proposes K-meaNet that combines the interpretable mechanism of K-means and the powerful information representation ability of neural networks. For the neural network in K-meaNet, its inputs, weights, and mathematical expressions of each layer have clear meanings. During training, if one cluster center is critical, the value of one of the weights in the neural network, the gate, corresponding to this cluster center will increase. At the same time, the position of this cluster center will be close to the ideal cluster center. Besides, the location of the cluster center(s) and the value(s) of the corresponding gate(s) will not change significantly. This endows K-meaNet with the ability to adaptively determine the location and number of cluster centers compared with K-means and its improved versions. Moreover, this adaptive ability is robust to the location of the initial cluster centers, the number of the initial cluster centers, and the number of features. On six synthetic datasets and three real datasets, numerical experiments verify that K-meaNet can adaptively determine the number of cluster centers and is robust to the location of the initial cluster centers, the number of the initial cluster centers, and the number of features.

AB Knowledge structure is a valid characteristic for assessing individuals' knowledge and guiding their future learning. Based on formal context, there are methods to construct a knowledge structure delineated by skill function and find learning paths. However, the skill functions considered in these methods are well-formed and the skills are independent. To overcome these limitations, this paper transforms a general skill function into a formal context to extend the methods of constructing knowledge structures and recommending learning paths. The construction method of knowledge structures is discussed based on the quasi-order relation among skills, which is suitable for the situation that skills are not independent. The recommendation method of learning paths is investigated based on the subsequent states and learning complexity of skills, which can realize personalized learning. Moreover, simulation experiments are performed on five data sets and show that it is necessary to consider the quasi-order relation among skills and that the methods proposed for finding and recommending learning paths are feasible.

   training
AB Facial semantic guidance (including facial landmarks, facial heatmaps, and facial parsing maps) and facial generative adversarial networks (GAN) prior have been widely used in blind face restoration (BFR) in recent years. Although existing BFR methods have achieved good performance in ordinary cases, these solutions have limited resilience when applied to face images with serious degradation and pose-varied (e.g., looking right, looking left, laughing, etc.) in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a well-designed blind face restoration network with generative facial prior. The proposed network is mainly comprised of an asymmetric codec and a StyleGAN2 prior network. In the asymmetric codec, we adopt a mixed multi-path residual block (MMRB) to gradually extract weak texture features of input images, which can better preserve the original facial features and avoid excessive fantasy. The MMRB can also be plug-and-play in other networks. Furthermore, thanks to the affluent and diverse facial priors of the StyleGAN2 model, we adopt it as the primary generator network in our proposed method and specially design a novel self-supervised training strategy to fit the distribution closer to the target and flexibly restore natural and realistic facial details. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model performs superior to the prior art for face restoration and face super-resolution tasks.

AB Subsea cables are widely used for power and information transmission in offshore infrastructure such as global communication networks and offshore wind farms. The precise positioning of subsea cables is an important prerequisite for maintenance and repair. However, the small diameter and burial depth of 3-5 m below the seabed make locating and detecting the subsea cable technically challenging. This paper investigates the localization and intelligent tracking detection of subsea cables based on autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. First, an autonomous electromagnetic localization and tracking topology of subsea cable is designed based on AUV architecture and PSO algorithm. The basic principle of locating the horizontal position and depth of a subsea cable based on horizontal survey line measurement is illustrated. Second, the PSO algorithm is retrofitted with electromagnetic localization. Specifically, the subsea cable localization flow diagram, region of interest (ROI) and fitness function are constructed, respectively. Third, an online swath path planning method for subsea cable detection is designed based on the PSO localization results. Finally, the effectiveness of the PSO submarine cable location algorithm and the online planning method for detection paths is verified through multiple controlled simulation tests.

ID SMALL TARGET DETECTION
AB Multi-target detection based on corner pooling provides a distinctive framework without anchor boxes, which has achieved wide application in the area of intelligent transportation system. To effectively detect small vehicles in the distant view, we propose an improved detection network termed corner pooling with attention mechanism (CPAM). A newly devised network called Hourglass with Coordinate Attention(Hourglass-CA) is proposed as an alternative to the Hourglass-104 backbone network. This one incorporates a multi-level attention mechanism to optimize the efficiency of feature extraction. Additionally, a novel multi-level attention loss(MLA loss) is presented, which dynamically adjusts the offsets during the feature extraction process. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CPAM achieves lightweight detection, reducing the parameters from 201M to 117M with an FPS from 4.2 to 16.1. Moreover, the AP can reach 51.6%, surpassing several existing detectors.

ID MANEUVER DECISION; UAV; SYSTEM
AB Autonomous decision-making in unmanned aerial vehicle (UVA) confrontations presents challenges in making optimal strategy. Therefore, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been adopted to address these issues. However, existing DRL decision-making models suffer from poor situational awareness and inability to distinguish between different intentions. Therefore, a multi-intent autonomous decision-making is proposed in this paper. First, three typical intentions are designed comprising head-on attacking, pursuing and fleeing to derive decision models representing different intentions. Reinforcement learning based air combat game model is constructed with different intentions, which contains designing reward functions for intentions to deal with the problem of sparse rewards. Then, we propose the Temporal Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO) algorithm, which optimizes the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm by integrating the long short-term memory network and feedforward neural network. This algorithm extracts the historical temporal information to enhance situational awareness. In addition, a basic-confrontation progressive training method is proposed to provide intention guidance and increase training diversity, which can improve learning efficiency and intelligent decision-making capability. Finally, experiments in our constructed UAV confrontation environment demonstrate that the proposed intentional decision models exhibit good performance in stability and learning efficiency, achieving high rewards, win rates, and low steps. Specifically, our autonomous decision-making increases win rate by 26% when head-on attacking and learning efficiency by 50% when pursuing. It is further proof of the potential and value of our multi-intent autonomous decision-making applications.

ID PREDICTION; CHURN; MODEL
AB Game Provenance has been proposed and employed for Game Analytics tasks as they capture game session data in detail and allow exploratory analysis and visualizations. Games are highly heterogeneous models with several interacting agents and game-world environment elements. Game Provenance Graphs can accommodate the heterogeneous nature of such applications with different types of nodes and edges that tend to share information across themselves, enhancing cause-effect features rarely addressed by any other approach. On the other hand, existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) solutions disregard node feature information, overlooking shared features across distinct node types, and rely on naive approaches, such as projecting each type of node to the same n-dimensional space. We conjecture that leveraging heterogeneous feature information is essential for tackling Game Analytics tasks, especially through Machine Learning based models. To achieve that, we propose a novel approach that allows HGNNs to leverage Game Provenance Graphs' heterogeneous node feature information. Hence, we introduce in this paper three strategies for Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning that encodes feature set information into the HGNN architecture and projects feature values leveraging similarities across such feature sets. We conduct experiments on two Game Provenance Graphs datasets, the Smoke Squadron and the Game Provenance Profile datasets, which gather game session data from different games. Our results show that encoding feature set information in the representation learning process improves the outcomes of GNN models in non-disjoint feature datasets.

ID TIME; SUPPORT
AB One of the main challenges in the industry is having trained and efficient operators in manufacturing lines. Smart adaptive guidance systems are developed that offer assistance to the operator during assembly. Depending on the operator's level of execution, the system should be able to serve a different guidance response. This paper investigates the assessment and classification of the operator's functional state using observed task execution times. Five different classifiers are studied for operator functional state classification on task execution time series. The experiments are based on an industry case and the ground truth is provided by an expert rule-based system. Three classification scenarios are defined that segment the problem on the level of the task, the individual, or the team. Furthermore, the investigation includes the evaluation of four distinct window-size configurations. The examination of how these scenarios and window-sizes influence the studied dataset across diverse classifiers reveals that achieving enhanced accuracy necessitates a larger input dimension. In this context, Convolutional Neural Networks predominantly exhibit superior performance compared to alternative classifiers. Careful attention needs to be paid to performance over classes and skills, but results confirm the validity of the approach for data-driven operator functional state classification.

DE Multi-target multi-camera tracking; Vehicle tracking; Online tracking
AB Multi-target multi-camera tracking (MTMCT) for vehicles, which aims to track multiple vehicles across multi-camera environments, is crucial in surveillance or intelligent transportation systems due to its broad applicability in real situations. However, the high inter-class similarity of vehicles and also their high intra-class variability due to the varying perspective, lighting, and video quality of each camera make it significantly challenging. Various offline approaches have been proposed and dominated the field with further advantages over the online strategy, but they are hardly adopted in real-world applications that usually require an online operation. In this paper, we propose a novel fast online MTMCT algorithm for vehicles considering better applicability in real applications. During the MTMCT, we actively reflect online MTSCT results, which is more reliable than clustering results in the multi-camera domain, on top of the object detection and feature extraction. To do so, we can effectively reduce the ID switches of the tracks and computational costs by decreasing the number of feature comparisons. As a result, we achieve 77.3 IDF1 on the S02 scenario of the CityFlow dataset with 0.012 seconds of tracking speed with four camera inputs.

AB This paper takes a two-level green supply chain composed of a manufacturer and a retailer as the research object, and investigates the influence of loss aversion preference and corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the optimal pricing, green decision-making and performance of supply chain members. Firstly, the basic game models under three different decision-making situations are constructed, and the optimal decision of the above models is obtained. Secondly, the results of different decision-making models are compared, and the influence of corporate social responsibility level and loss aversion preference on supply chain decision-making and performance is analyzed. Finally, in order to improve the performance of supply chain, a combined contract of revenue sharing and responsibility sharing is designed to coordinate the green supply chain under different preferences of the manufacturer. The results show that the retailer undertaking CSR is conducive to the green development of the supply chain, but the loss aversion preference of the manufacturer will have a negative impact on the supply chain members. In addition, when the manufacturer has rational preference, with the improvement of the retailer's CSR level, the effective coordination interval length of coordination factors under combined contracts increases, and the coordination flexibility of supply chain increases. When the manufacturer loss aversion preference, the upper and lower limits of the coordination factor of the combined contract will increase with the increase of loss aversion preference, and the length of the coordination interval will decrease, which will lead to the difficulty of cooperation among supply chain members.

AB The aesthetic dimension has been proposed as a potential expansion of sonification design, creating listening pieces that reach the goal of effective data communication. However, current views of aesthetics still aim at optimising mapping criteria to convey the 'right meaning', maintaining a mostly functional view on what is considered a successful sonification. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary approach to the aesthetics of sonification experience, grounded on theoretical foundations from phenomenology of interaction, post-phenomenology, cross-cultural studies, acoustic ecology and deep listening. From this journey, we present the following design insights: (1) the design of sonifications becomes a design for experience, (2) co-designed during the interaction with each participant; (3) the sonification artefact gains a mediating role that guides the participant's intentions in the sonification space; (4) the aesthetics of a sonification experience generates a multistable phenomenon, offering new opportunities to experience multiple perspectives over data; (5) the interaction between human participants and the sonic emanations compose a dialogic space. A call for action to reframe the sonification field into novel design spaces is now open, with aesthetics gaining a transformational role in sonification design and interaction.

TI Trustworthy residual vehicle value prediction for auto finance
SO AI MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB The residual value (RV) of a vehicle refers to its estimated worth at some point in the future. It is a core component in every auto finance product, used to determine the credit lines and the leasing rates. As such, an accurate prediction of RV is critical for the auto finance industry, since it can pose a risk of revenue loss by over-prediction or make the financial product incompetent through under-prediction. Although there are a number of prior studies on training machine learning models on a large amount of used car sales data, we had to cope with real-world operational requirements such as compliance with regulations (i.e., monotonicity of output with respect to a subset of features) and generalization to unseen input (i.e., new and rare car models). In this paper, we describe how we addressed these practical challenges and created value for our business at Hyundai Capital Services, the top auto financial service provider in Korea.

AB Scientific communities are still motivated to create novel approaches and methodologies for early estimation of software project development efforts and testing efforts in soft computing environments due to scheduling and budgetary concerns. Therefore, the software engineering prediction problems (SEPPs) are formulated as machine learning (ML) models with the aim of addressing these issues. In such methodologies that may exhibit significant limitations and drawbacks, efficient metaheuristic approaches are essential to improving prediction performance. Accordingly, this study aims to address software test effort prediction (STP) and software development effort prediction (SEP) with the aim of maximizing prediction accuracy, which in turn minimizes overall project costs and optimizes resource allocation. To achieve this goal, we developed several ML models composed of a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The proposed models contain the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), which is utilized to replace the traditional network training method and tackle its limitations. The models also contain the great deluge (GD) local search algorithm, which is hybridized with the SSA algorithm to enhance optimization capabilities by finding more balance between exploration and exploitation. During the validation stage of this study, fourteen benchmark datasets were utilized to evaluate the developed models for each of the respective problems. The obtained results were quantified using eight performance metrics and compared across two sections. In the first section, a comparison was made between the results of the hybrid-developed model (HSSA) and those of the standard SSA algorithm and BPNN. In the second comparison, the performance of the HSSA model was compared with several contemporary techniques that are considered state-of-the-art. The evaluation shows that the HSSA performs better than related approaches in most cases for both problems. Finally, additional analysis was performed on the collected results, including examinations of statistical significance, distribution through box plots, and model convergence behavior.

AB During pineapple cultivation, detecting and counting the number of pineapple flowers in real time and estimating the yield are essential. Deep learning methods are more efficient in real-time performance than traditional manual detection. However, existing deep learning models are characterized by low detection speeds and cannot be applied in real time on mobile devices. This paper presents a lightweight model in which filter pruning compresses the YOLOv5 network. An adaptive batch normalization layer evaluation mechanism is introduced to the pruning process to evaluate the performance of the subnetwork. With this approach, the network with the best performance can be found quickly after pruning. Then, an efficient channel attention mechanism is added for the pruned network to constitute a new YOLOv5_E network. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed YOLOv5_E network attains an accuracy of 71.7% with a mere 1.7 M parameters, a model size of 3.8 MB, and an impressive running speed of 178 frames per second. Compared to the original YOLOv5, YOLOv5_E shows a 0.9% marginal decrease in accuracy; while, the number of parameters and the model size are reduced by 75.8% and 73.8%, respectively. Moreover, the running speed of YOLOv5_E is nearly twice that of the original. Among the ten networks evaluated, YOLOv5_E boasts the fastest detection speed and ranks second in detection accuracy. Furthermore, YOLOv5_E can be integrated with StrongSORT for real-time detection and counting on mobile devices. We validated this on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX development board, where it achieved an average detection speed of 24 frames per second. The proposed YOLOv5_E network can be effectively used on agricultural equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles, providing technical support for the detection and counting of crops on mobile devices.

AB Morphing attacks (MAs) pose a substantial security threat to the Automatic Border Control (ABC) system. While a few morphing attack detection (MAD) methods have been proposed, the face morphing accomplice's facial restoration has not received sufficient attention. Due to the inability to foresee the morphing factor used for a particular morphed image, selecting the appropriate de-morphing factor becomes a challenging problem in the restoration of the accomplice's facial image. If the morphing factor cannot be chosen reasonably, achieving the desired restoration effect is difficult. Therefore, this paper presents an adaptive de-morphing factor framework (ADFF) architecture for restoring the accomplice's facial image. By exploiting the morphed images stored in the electronic passport system and the real-time captured criminal's images, ADFF can effectively restore the accomplice's facial image. Experimental results and analysis show that ADFF can significantly reduce the security threats of MAs on ABC.
   Here, an adaptive de-morphing factor framework (ADFF) is proposed to restore the accomplice's facial image. A pioneering de-morphing factor prediction network is proposed, which can better handle the variations in the degree of morphing across different images, to improve the quality of restored accomplice's facial images.image

AB This paper proposes a unified framework to achieve the finite/fixed-time synchronization of memristor-based fuzzy delayed neural networks considering both Markov jumping phenomenon and external disturbance. Under the designed common controller, by regulating its main control parameters, the goals of finite-time and fixed-time synchronization for the network can be achieved separately. Besides, by integrating algebraic inequality technologies, the fuzzy set theory and Lyapunov theory, a new finite/fixed-time theorem can be obtained for the drive-response system. Taking into account more complex Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional involving mode-dependent terms and double integral terms, is more closer to practical applications than those in the existing results. Finally, an example is presented to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB The increasing number of devices and frequent interactions of agents from networked multiagent systems (MASs) exacerbate the risks of potential cyber attacks, especially the different point attacks and multiple pattern attacks. This article considers the output formation-containment problem for MASs under multipoint multipattern false data injection (FDI) attacks. The multipoint describes the attacks simultaneously occurring on the sensors, actuators, and communication channels; the multipattern captures that sensor and actuator attack signals are both continuous deterministic variables, and the communication channel attack signals are intermittent random variables, obeying the Bernoulli distribution. For such compromised MASs, a novel hybrid protocol is proposed, which integrates a state observer, an attack estimator, an impulsive interactor and a compensation controller. Thereinto, the state observer and the attack estimator are constructed to recover the unmeasured system states and the unknown FDI attack signals, respectively; the impulsive interactor is designed to guarantee that the neighbor's signals are transmitted only at impulsive instants, and meanwhile the channel attacks are randomly launched; using the recovered signals, the compensation controller is devised to alleviate the effect of attacks. A sufficient condition is identified, under which the output formation containment is achieved with cooperative uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB). Finally, simulation results are carried out to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.

AB Artificial intelligence-based question-answering (QA) systems can expedite the performance of various tasks. These systems either read passages and answer questions given in natural languages or if a question is given, they extract the most accurate answer from documents retrieved from the internet. Arabic is spoken by Arabs and Muslims and is located in the middle of the Arab world, which encompasses the Middle East and North Africa. It is difficult to use natural language processing techniques to process modern Arabic owing to the language's complex morphology, orthographic ambiguity, regional variations in spoken Arabic, and limited linguistic and technological resources. Only a few Arabic QA experiments and systems have been designed on small datasets, some of which are yet to be made available. Although several reviews of Arabic QA studies have been conducted, the number of studies covered has been limited and recent trends have not been included. To the best of our knowledge, only two systematic reviews focused on Arabic QA have been published to date. One covered only 26 primary studies without considering recent techniques, while the other covered only nine studies conducted for Holy Qur'an QA systems. Here, the included studies were analyzed in terms of the datasets used, domains covered, types of Arabic questions asked, information retrieved, the mechanism used to extract answers, and the techniques used. Based on the results of the analysis, several limitations, concerns, and recommendations for future research were identified. Additionally, a novel taxonomy was developed to categorize the techniques used based on the domains and approaches of the QA system.

TI Ultrasound image segmentation based on Transformer and U-Net with joint

   Joint loss
AB Background: Ultrasound image segmentation is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and poor quality of ultrasound images. With deep learning advancements, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for ultrasound image segmentation. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolutional operations and the varying shapes of segmentation objects, segmentation methods based on CNNs still face challenges with accuracy and generalization. In addition, Transformer is a network architecture with self-attention mechanisms that performs well in the field of computer vision. Based on the characteristics of Transformer and CNNs, we propose a hybrid architecture based on Transformer and U-Net with joint loss for ultrasound image segmentation, referred to as TU-Net.Methods: TU-Net is based on the encoder-decoder architecture and includes encoder, parallel attention mechanism and decoder modules. The encoder module is responsible for reducing dimensions and capturing different levels of feature information from ultrasound images; the parallel attention mechanism is responsible for capturing global and multiscale local feature information; and the decoder module is responsible for gradually recovering dimensions and delineating the boundaries of the segmentation target. Additionally, we adopt joint loss to optimize learning and improve segmentation accuracy. We use experiments on datasets of two types of ultrasound images to verify the proposed architecture. We use the Dice scores, precision, recall, Hausdorff distance (HD) and average symmetric surface distance (ASD) as evaluation metrics for segmentation performance.Results: For the brachia plexus and fetal head ultrasound image datasets, TU-Net achieves mean Dice scores of 79.59% and 97.94%; precisions of 81.25% and 98.18%; recalls of 80.19% and 97.72%; HDs (mm) of 12.44 and 6.93; and ASDs (mm) of 4.29 and 2.97, respectively. Compared with those of the other six segmentation algorithms, the mean values of TU-Net increased by approximately 3.41%, 2.62%, 3.74%, 36.40% and 31.96% for the Dice score, precision, recall, HD and ASD, respectively.

TI Emotion Recognition From Multimodal Physiological Signals via

AB Modeling correlations between multimodal physiological signals e.g., canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for emotion recognition has attracted much attention. However, existing studies rarely consider the neural nature of emotional responses within physiological signals. Furthermore, during fusion space construction, the CCA method maximizes only the correlations between different modalities and neglects the discriminative information of different emotional states. Most importantly, temporal mismatches between different neural activities are often ignored; therefore, the theoretical assumptions that multimodal data should be aligned in time and space before fusion are not fulfilled. To address these issues, we propose a discriminative correlation fusion method coupled with a temporal alignment mechanism for multimodal physiological signals. We first use neural signal analysis techniques to construct neural representations of the central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS). respectively. Then, emotion class labels are introduced in CCA to obtain more discriminative fusion representations from multimodal neural responses, and the temporal alignment between the CNS and ANS is jointly optimized with a fusion procedure that applies the Bayesian algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the emotion recognition performance. Additionally, we show that this fusion method can model the underlying mechanisms in human nervous systems during emotional responses, and our results are consistent with prior findings. This study may guide a new approach for exploring human cognitive function based on physiological signals at different time scales and promote the development of computational intelligence and harmonious human-computer interactions.

TI Enhancing framelet GCNs with generalized p-Laplacian regularization

DT Article; Early Access
DE Graph neural networks; Graph framelets; p-Laplacian regularization
ID GRAPH
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable results for various graph learning tasks. However, one of the recent challenges for GNNs is to adapt to different types of graph inputs, such as heterophilic graph datasets in which linked nodes are more likely to contain a different class of labels and features. Accordingly, an ideal GNN model should adaptively accommodate all types of graph datasets with different labeling distributions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing a regularization framework on graph framelet with the regularizer induced from graph p-Laplacian. By adjusting the value of p, the p-Laplacian based regularizer restricts the solution space of graph framelet into the desirable region based on the graph homophilic features. We propose an algorithm to effectively solve a more generalized regularization problem and prove that the algorithm imposes a (p-Laplacian based) spectral convolution and diagonal scaling operation to the framelet filtered node features. Furthermore, we analyze the denoising power of the proposed model and compare it with the predefined framelet denoising regularizer. Finally, we conduct empirical studies to show the prediction power of the proposed model in both homophily undirect and heterophily direct graphs with and without noises. Our proposed model shows significant improvements compared to multiple baselines, and this suggests the effectiveness of combining graph framelet and p-Laplacian.

AB There is demand for scalable algorithms capable of clustering and analyzing large time series data. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised artificial neural network for clustering, visualizing, and reducing the dimensionality of complex data. Like all clustering methods, it requires a measure of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer that accommodates distortions when aligning time series. Despite its popularity in clustering, DTW is limited in practice because the runtime complexity is quadratic with the length of the time series. To address this, we present a new a self-organizing map for clustering TIME Series, called SOMTimeS, which uses DTW as the distance measure. The method has similar accuracy compared with other DTW-based clustering algorithms, yet scales better and runs faster. The computational performance stems from the pruning of unnecessary DTW computations during the SOM's training phase. For comparison, we implement a similar pruning strategy for K-means, and call the latter K-TimeS. SOMTimeS and K-TimeS pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations, respectively. Pruning effectiveness, accuracy, execution time and scalability are evaluated using 112 benchmark time series datasets from the UC Riverside classification archive, and show that for similar accuracy, a 1.8x speed-up on average for SOMTimeS and K-TimeS, respectively with that rates vary between 1 x and 18x depending on the dataset. We also apply SOMTimeS to a healthcare study of patient-clinician serious illness conversations to demonstrate the algorithm's utility with complex, temporally sequenced natural language.

AB Whenever a new supervised machine learning (ML) algorithm or solution is developed, it is imperative to evaluate the predictive performance it attains for diverse datasets. This is done in order to stress test the strengths and weaknesses of the novel algorithms and provide evidence for situations in which they are most useful. A common practice is to gather some datasets from public benchmark repositories for such an evaluation. But little or no specific criteria are used in the selection of these datasets, which is often ad-hoc. In this paper, the importance of gathering a diverse benchmark of datasets in order to properly evaluate ML models and really understand their capabilities is investigated. Leveraging from meta-learning studies evaluating the diversity of public repositories of datasets, this paper introduces an optimization method to choose varied classification and regression datasets from a pool of candidate datasets. The method is based on maximum coverage, circular packing, and the meta-heuristic Lichtenberg Algorithm for ensuring that diverse datasets able to challenge the ML algorithms more broadly are chosen. The selections were compared experimentally with a random selection of datasets and with clustering by k-medoids and proved to be more effective regarding the diversity of the chosen benchmarks and the ability to challenge the ML algorithms at different levels.

ID FRAUD DETECTION
AB Association rules mining with the Chinese social insurance fund dataset can effectively discover different kinds of errors, irregularities, and illegal acts by providing auditors with relationships among the items and therefore improve auditing quality and efficiency. However, traditional positive and negative association rules (PNARs) mining algorithms inevitably produce too many meaningless or contradictory rules when these two types of rules are mined simultaneously, which brings a huge challenge to auditors retrieving decision information. Aimed to reduce the quantity of low-reliability PNARs without missing interesting rules, this paper first proposes an improved PNARs mining algorithm with minimum correlation and triple confidence threshold to control the mined rules number by narrowing the range of confidence settings. Then, a novel pruning algorithm based on the inclusion relation of the rule's antecedent and consequent is given to remove those redundant rules. After that, the proposed optimized PNARs mining approach is applied to the Chinese social insurance fund dataset starting with audit features influence factors mining using the Hash table. The experimental results with different datasets show that the proposed framework not only can ensure effective and interesting rules extraction but also has better performance than traditional approaches in both accuracy and efficiency, reducing the number of redundant PNARs by over 70.1% with experimental datasets and average 78.5% with auditing data mining, respectively.

   classification; comment generation
AB As a fundamental component of software documentation, code comments could help developers comprehend and maintain programs. Several datasets of method header comments have been proposed in previous studies for machine learning-based code comment generation. As part of code comments, inline code comments are also crucial for code understanding activities. However, unlike method header comments written in a standard format and describing the whole method code, inline comments are often written in arbitrary formats by developers due to timelines pressures and different aspects of code snippets in the method are described. Currently, there is no large-scale dataset used for inline comments generation considering these. Hence, this naturally inspires us to explore whether we can construct a dataset to foster machine learning research that not only performs fine-grained noise-cleaning but conducts a taxonomy of inline comments. To this end, we first collect inline comments and code snippets from 8000 Java projects on GitHub. Then, we conduct a manual review to obtain heuristic rules, which could be used to clean the data noise in a fine-grained manner. As a result, we construct a large-scale benchmark dataset named ICG with 5,740,770 pairs of inline comments and code snippets. We then build a comprehensive taxonomy and conduct a statistical and manual analysis to explore the performances of different categories of inline comments, such as helpfulness in code understanding. After that, we provide and compare several baseline models to automatically generate inline comments, such as CodeBERT, to enhance the usability of the benchmark for researchers. The availability of our benchmark and baselines can help develop and validate new inline comment generation methods, which would also further facilitate code understanding activities.

AB Time series analysis is the process of exploring and analyzing past trends to predict future events for any given time interval. Powered by recent advances in convolutional, recurrent and self-attention mechanisms, many deep learning methods have facilitated the investigation of time series forecasting. However, despite their effectiveness, it is doubtful that future trends can be accurately predicted due to the intricate temporal irregularities. Plus, time series frequently exhibit features at various time scales, but existing approaches do not adequately take this into account. To address above issues, this paper offers a new Multi-scale Adaptive attention-based Time-Variant neural Networks (MATVN) for multi-step ahead time series forecasting. Specifically, we contribute a novel framework capable of capturing irregular dynamic behaviors observed in temporal data over time with a Time-Variant architecture. Furthermore, a newly proposed Multi-scale Multi-head Adaptive attention module is introduced into the Time-Variant architecture to encode temporal dependencies from various pre-defined scale-aware ranges. Additionally, we endow the proposed module with more flexible individual representation learning and scale-aware attention scopes for each token to better capture multi-scale temporal patterns by designing a new Adaptive Window-aware Mask strategy. Experimental results on the vast majority of application scenarios, including climatology and energy consumption, demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms a lot of recent state-of-the-art methods in multi-step time series forecasting tasks.

AB In traditional secret image sharing schemes, a secret image is shared among shareholders who have the same position. But if the shareholders have two different positions, essential and non-essential, it is necessary to use essential secret image sharing schemes. In this article, a verifiable essential secret image sharing scheme based on HLRs is proposed. Shareholder's share consists of two parts. The first part is produced by the shareholders, which prevents the fraud of dealers. The second part is a shadow image that is produced by using HLRs and the first part of share. The verification of the first part of the shares is done for the first time by using multilinear and bilinear maps. Also, for verifying shadow images, Bloom Filters are used for the first time. The proposed scheme is more efficient than similar schemes, and for the first part of the shares, has formal security.

ID DECISION-MAKING METHOD; FRAMEWORK
AB With consideration for the extensive resources consumption and environmental degradation being on the rise today, implementing green development strategy to pursue both socioeconomic growth and the coordinated of environment sustainability, has become an increasingly important issue in modern enterprise supply chain operations management. Hence, the appropriate green supplier selection (GSS), viewed as a core issue in green supply chain management (GSCM), requires continuous research in this field to obtain a complete perception on GSS practices. It can be regarded as a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem that involves many conflict and unmeasurable evaluation criteria. In view of the superiority of multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic term sets (MGEPLTSs) in modeling such issues on potential ambiguity, complexity and uncertainty in actual GSS practices, we propose a novel integrated MAGDM methodology for GSS problems, by integrating the BWM (best-worst method) with the VIKOR (VIsekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje) technique under the MGEPLTSs environment. First, by introducing the multi-granularity and probabilistic linguistic term sets, the MGEPLTSs are proposed to represent and quantify the decision information of GSCM practitioners. Then, the BWM is introduced to the MGEPLTSs environment to compute the weights of decision-making panels and evaluation attributes in GSS problems, by building the fuzzy mathematical programming model, respectively. Finally, we extend a multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic VIKOR method to calculate the compromise measure of alternatives considering the group utility maximization and the individual regret minimization, thereby achieving the full ranking of alternatives. A GSS case is conducted to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with other similar approaches are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness and advantages.

AB The process of feature mapping is used to represent features on a map with their corresponding properties. The features are displayed visually and their associated information is made available. Various abstraction approaches, including alignment approaches, are introduced to reduce the computational complexity. However, previous works based on standard treatments of feature maps often suffer from the negative effects of noise and background details. To solve this problem, we present a simple and effective implementation approach for Filter Pruning via Attention Consistency (FPAC), which determines a revolutionary filter pruning mechanism. Feature maps that concentrate on a single layer are inconsistent, which can affect the spatial dimension. The feature map with minimum consistency is less significant and is experimentally demonstrated. This study presents a novel layer-wise pruning technique using the Aphid Ant Mutualism (AAM) algorithm, which considers the sensitivity of various convolutional network layers to model inference and sets the optimal pruning ratio. The accuracy of the compressed model is enhanced by eliminating high redundancy through pruning correlated filters. The performance of FPAC is confirmed through the Caltech 256 image dataset. With VGG-16 on the Caltech 256 image dataset, the classification accuracy is enhanced from 93.96 to 94.03%. With ResNet-50 on the Caltech 256 image dataset, 45% FLOPs are achieved with an accuracy loss of only 0.53%.

AB The adaptive predefined settling time performance tracking control for a class of uncertain nonlinear network systems with fast time-varying or even abrupt reference signals is studied. In this paper, an improved performance function with time-varying boundary (following the change of reference signal) is designed to overcome the problem that the traditional prescribed performance control (PPC) can only converge to a constant in steady state. Compared with the existing adaptive finite time prescribed performance congestion control for tracking fixed value reference signals, an adaptive predefined settling time prescribed performance congestion control strategy is proposed by means of some new recursive construction (introducing nonautonomous differential equations (NDE)) and analysis innovation. In addition, the network system considered in this paper is more general. Under the framework of backstepping, NDE is used iteratively to control the approximation error with boundary inequality. It is proved theoretically that all signals of the closed-loop system are predefined settling time bounded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulations.

ID VERSATILE
AB We analyse, for the first time, the popular loop closing module of a well known and widely used open-source visual SLAM (ORB-SLAM) pipeline. Investigating failures in the loop closure module of visual SLAM is challenging since it consists of multiple building blocks. Our meticulous investigations have revealed a few interesting findings. Contrary to reported results, ORB-SLAM frequently misses large fraction of loop closures on public (KITTI, TUM RGB-D) datasets. One common assumption is, in such scenarios, the visual place recognition (vPR) block of the loop closure module is unable to find a suitable match due to extreme conditions (dynamic scene, viewpoint/scale changes). We report that native vPR of ORB-SLAM is not the sole reason for these failures. Although recent deep vPR alternatives achieve impressive matching performance, replacing native vPR with these deep alternatives will only partially improve loop closure performance of visual SLAM. Our findings suggest that the problem lies with the subsequent relative pose estimation module between the matching pair. ORB-SLAM3 has improved the recall of the original loop closing module. However, even in ORB-SLAM3, the loop closing module is the major reason behind loop closing failures. Surprisingly, using off-the-shelf ORB and SIFT based relative pose estimators (non real-time) manages to close most of the loops missed by ORB-SLAM. This significant performance gap between the two available methods suggests that ORB-SLAM's pipeline can be further matured by focusing on the relative pose estimators, to improve loop closure performance, rather than investing more resources on improving vPR. We also evaluate deep alternatives for relative pose estimation in the context of loop closures. Interestingly, the performance of deep relocalization methods (e.g. MapNet) is worse than classic methods even in loop closures scenarios. This finding further supports the fundamental limitation of deep relocalization methods recently diagnosed. Finally, we expose bias in well-known public dataset (KITTI) due to which these commonly occurring failures have eluded the community. We augment the KITTI dataset with detailed loop closing labels. In order to compensate for the bias in the public datasets, we provide a challenging loop closure dataset which contains challenging yet commonly occurring indoor navigation scenarios with loop closures. We hope our findings and the accompanying dataset will help the community in further improving the popular ORB-SLAM's pipeline.

ID EDGE-DETECTION
AB Visual obstacle discovery is a key step towards autonomous navigation of indoor mobile robots. Successful solutions have many applications in multiple scenes. One of the exceptions is the reflective ground. In this case, the reflections on the floor resemble the true world, which confuses the obstacle discovery and leaves navigation unsuccessful. We argue that the key to this problem lies in obtaining discriminative features for reflections and obstacles. Note that obstacle and reflection can be separated by the ground plane in 3D space. With this observation, we firstly introduce a pre-calibration based ground detection scheme that uses robot motion to predict the ground plane. Due to the immunity of robot motion to reflection, this scheme avoids failed ground detection caused by reflection. Given the detected ground, we design a ground-pixel parallax to describe the location of a pixel relative to the ground. Based on this, a unified appearance-geometry feature representation is proposed to describe objects inside rectangular boxes. Eventually, based on segmenting by detection framework, an appearance-geometry fusion regressor is designed to utilize the proposed feature to discover the obstacles. It also prevents our model from concentrating too much on parts of obstacles instead of whole obstacles. For evaluation, we introduce a new dataset for Obstacle on Reflective Ground (ORG), which comprises 15 scenes with various ground reflections, a total of more than 200 image sequences and 3400 RGB images. The pixel-wise annotations of ground and obstacle provide a comparison to our method and other methods. By reducing the misdetection of the reflection, the proposed approach outperforms others. The source code and the dataset will be available at https://github.com/xuefeng-cvr/IndoorObstacleDiscovery-RG

AB Sentiment classification is a prevalent task in text mining in which a text classifies into positive, negative, or neutral classes. Sentiment classification is an essential issue of decision-making for people, companies, etc. Feature selection is the most influential stage in sentiment classification. Due to the NP-hard nature of the problem and a huge of existing texts, the traditional feature selection techniques, such as statistical techniques, generate sub-optimal solutions. Swarm intelligence algorithms are extensively devoted to optimization problems. These algorithms produce features by increasing the classification performance and decreasing the computational complexity and feature set size. In this study, the authors proposed a framework using the modified multi-objective Firefly algorithm, namely FANS (Firefly Algorithm Naive Bayes Sentiment). The two targets are decreasing the naive Bayes error classifier and the k-nearest neighbor. A neural network is used as the final classifier. The three datasets on Movie review and Twitter domains are applied to evaluate the FANS. The FANS outperform its counterparts regarding precision, accuracy, and recall. The FANS yields 96.88% precision, 97.65% accuracy, and 96.54% recall.

AB In this paper, a method of stroke-based rendering is proposed for image representation and reconstruction. The proposed method involves compositing a set of ellipses that greatly vary in location, size, rotation angle, color, and opacity. This study proves that alpha compositing is differentiable if a two-dimensional Gaussian function is used to draw a solid ellipse. The gradient method can then be employed for automatically identifying the parameters of each ellipse such that the difference between the input image and the composited image is minimized. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can represent various types of images including portraits, landscapes, buildings, street scenes, artificial objects, medical images etc. The proposed method can particularly render the most details and significant features of an input image with fewer strokes compared to other stroke-based rendering algorithms. This study also demonstrates that the proposed method can be applied in painting style simulation and sparse-view computed tomography imaging.

AB Neuron localization is a fundamental step in the neuron morphology reconstruction and quantitative analysis of cell counting and spatial distribution. The recent development of labelling and imaging techniques has resulted in growing demand for automatic neuron localization methods of 3D neuronal microscopy images. However, accurately localizing touching neurons remains a challenge. To address this issue, a novel method utilizing a super-resolution segmentation network based on 2D Conv-LSTM and a region growing method are proposed. This network can map and detect individual neurons in higher resolution space, allowing for the separation of closely touching neurons with reduced resource consumption. Subsequently, a region growing method is employed to localize neurons accurately. This method is evaluated using neuronal images generated by TDI-fMOST. This method achieved neuron localization with an F1 score of 0.91. In comparison, other automatic localization methods achieved F1 scores lower than 0.85. It is also demonstrated that our network has fewer computational requirements compared to 3D neural networks. This method is promising for accurately localizing neurons in large-scale neuron images.

ID LEVEL
AB Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique that allows agents to learn optimal decision-making policies through interactions with an environment. However, traditional RL algorithms suffer from several limitations such as the need for large amounts of data and long-term credit assignment, i.e. the problem of determining which actions actually produce a certain reward. Recently, Transformers have shown their capacity to address these constraints in this area of learning in an offline setting. This paper proposes a framework that uses Transformers to enhance the training of online off-policy RL agents and address the challenges described above through self-attention. The proposal introduces a hybrid agent with a mixed policy that combines an online off-policy agent with an offline Transformer agent using the Decision Transformer architecture. By sequentially exchanging the experience replay buffer between the agents, the agent's learning training efficiency is improved in the first iterations and so is the training of Transformer-based RL agents in situations with limited data availability or unknown environments.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

DT Article
AB Named Entity Recognition (NER) has so far evolved from the traditional flat NER to overlapped and discontinuous NER. They have mostly been solved separately, with only several exceptions that concurrently tackle three tasks with a single model. The current best-performing method formalizes the unified NER as word-word relation classification, which barely focuses on mention content learning and fails to detect entity mentions comprising a single word. In this paper, we propose a two-stage span-based framework with templates, namely, T-2-NER, to resolve the unified NER task. The first stage is to extract entity spans, where flat and overlapped entities can be recognized. The second stage is to classify over all entity span pairs, where discontinuous entities can be recognized. Finally, multi-task learning is used to jointly train two stages. To improve the efficiency of span-based model, we design grouped templates and typed templates for two stages to realize batch computations. We also apply an adjacent packing strategy and a latter packing strategy to model discriminative boundary information and learn better span (pair) representation. Moreover, we introduce the syntax information to enhance our span representation. We perform extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets for flat, overlapped, and discontinuous NER, where our model beats all the current competitive baselines, obtaining the best performance of unified NER.

AB The interpeak latency is a crucial characteristic of upper limb somatosensory evoked potentials (USEPs). However, the existing research on the correlation between interpeak latency and consciousness disorders is currently limited. We aimed to investigate how USEPs can contribute to the diagnosis of consciousness disorders. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 10 patients who underwent repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for consciousness disorders. The interpeak latency N13-N20, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), and Chinese Nanjing persistent vegetative state scale (CNPVSS) were evaluated before and after rTMS treatment, and the linear correlation between N13-N20, GCS, and CNPVSS was analysed. The scores of CNPVSS and GCS significantly increased in the first, second, and third months after rTMS. The N13-N20 was shorter in the second and third months after rTMS compared to before treatment. rTMS was found to shorten the N13-N20 latency, and there was a negative correlation between N13-N20 and the score of consciousness disorders. N13-N20 can serve as an objective index for evaluating consciousness disorders. This research provides potential insights for doctors in diagnosing patients with consciousness disorders.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Dual adaptation; feature noise; label noise; noise correction;
   unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) promotes target learning via a single-directional transfer from label-rich source domain to unlabeled target, while its reverse adaption from target to source has not been jointly considered yet. In real teaching practice, a teacher helps students learn and also gets promotion from students, and such a virtuous cycle inspires us to explore dual-directional transfer between domains. In fact, target pseudo-labels predicted by source commonly involve noise due to model bias; moreover, source domain usually contains innate noise, which inevitably aggravates target noise, leading to noise amplification. Transfer from target to source exploits target knowledge to rectify the adaptation, consequently enables better source transfer, and exploits a virtuous transfer circle. To this end, we propose a dual-correction-adaptation network (DualCAN), in which adaptation and correction cycle between domains, such that learning in both domains can be boosted gradually. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first naive attempt of dual-directional adaptation. Empirical results validate DualCAN with remarkable performance gains, particularly for extreme noisy tasks (e.g., approximately +10% on D -> A of Office-31 with 40% label corruption).

AB When humans hear the sound of an object, they recall associated visual information and integrate the sound with recalled visual modality to detect the object. In this article, we present a novel sound-based object detector that mimics this process. We design a visual modality recalling (VMR) memory to recall information of a visual modality based on an audio modal input (i.e., sound). To achieve this goal, we propose a VMR loss and an audio-visual association loss to guide the VMR memory to memorize visual modal information by establishing associations between audio and visual modalities. With the visual modal information recalled through the VMR memory along with the original audio input, we perform audio-visual integration. In this step, we introduce an integrated feature contrastive loss that allows the integrated feature to be embedded as if it were encoded using both audio and visual modal inputs. This guidance enables our sound-based object detector to effectively perform visual object detection even when only sound is provided. We believe that our work is a cornerstone study that offers a new perspective to conventional object detection studies that solely rely on the visual modality. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with the VMR memory.

AB BackgroundDue to the lower reliability of laboratory tests, skin diseases are more suitable for diagnosis with AI models. There are limited AI dermatology diagnostic models combining images and text; few of these are for Asian populations, and few cover the most common types of diseases.MethodsLeveraging a dataset sourced from Asia comprising over 200,000 images and 220,000 medical records, we explored a deep learning-based system for Dual-channel images and extracted text for the diagnosis of skin diseases model DIET-AI to diagnose 31 skin diseases, which covers the majority of common skin diseases. From 1 September to 1 December 2021, we prospectively collected images from 6,043 cases and medical records from 15 hospitals in seven provinces in China. Then the performance of DIET-AI was compared with that of six doctors of different seniorities in the clinical dataset.ResultsThe average performance of DIET-AI in 31 diseases was not less than that of all the doctors of different seniorities. By comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity, we demonstrate that the DIET-AI model is effective in clinical scenarios. In addition, medical records affect the performance of DIET-AI and physicians to varying degrees.ConclusionThis is the largest dermatological dataset for the Chinese demographic. For the first time, we built a Dual-channel image classification model on a non-cancer dermatitis dataset with both images and medical records and achieved comparable diagnostic performance to senior doctors about common skin diseases. It provides references for exploring the feasibility and performance evaluation of DIET-AI in clinical use afterward.

AB Underwater image enhancement has drawn a lot of attention due to its significance in ocean exploration. Since it is extremely hard to obtain a degraded image and its clear version in the same scene, most deep learning-based methods utilize synthetic datasets for training. However, synthetic datasets often fail to describe the natural appearance and show poor capabilities of generalization to real scenes. In this study, we present an in-air to underwater image enhancement (IUIE) framework that overcomes the limitations of underwater synthetic datasets. Specifically, the presented framework consists of a color correction step and a domain adaptation step. In the color correction step, we propose a color correction mechanism by utilizing the white balance algorithm to eliminate color bias and produce a more natural appearance. In the domain adaptation step, the network can reduce the domain gap between the in-air domain and the underwater domain and obtain a better generalization in real scenes. To accommodate spatially varying textures and edges, we propose a residual adaptive module in the domain adaptation network. Experimental results on the test data indicate that our IUIE framework not only obtains more remarkable UIQM and BRISQUE scores than the previous methods do but also achieves superior results in visual perception.

AB Partial Periodic Pattern Mining (3PM) is a key knowledge discovery technique with many applications. It involves discovering all patterns that have exhibited partial periodic behavior in a temporal database. Unfortunately, the widespread adoption of this technique has been hindered by the following two limitations: (i) the rare item problem, which involves either missing the patterns containing rare items or producing too many patterns, most of which may be uninteresting to the user, and (ii) computationally expensive mining process as its mining algorithms were inefficient in reducing the enormous search space. This paper makes the following efforts to address the above-mentioned two limitations. First, we introduce a new null-invariant measure, periodic-confidence, to determine the periodic interestingness of a pattern in a database. Second, an alternative model of a partial periodic pattern has been defined based on the proposed measure. Third, an efficient depth-first search algorithm based on the renowned pattern-growth technique has been introduced to discover all partial periodic patterns in a database. Fourth, the proposed algorithm employs a novel lossless pruning technique called "irregularity pruning" to reduce the search space and computational cost-efficiently. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our model can effectively tackle the rare item problem and our algorithm is efficient. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of patterns with case studies performed on air pollution and traffic congestion databases.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic caused millions of infections and deaths globally requiring effective solutions to fight the pandemic. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides data transmission without human intervention and thus mitigates infection chances. A road map is discussed in this study regarding the role of IoT applications to combat COVID-19. In addition, a real-time solution is provided to identify and monitor COVID-19 patients. The proposed framework comprises data collection using IoTbased devices, a health or quarantine center, a data warehouse for artificial intelligence (AI)-based analysis, and healthcare professionals to provide treatment. The efficacy of several machine learning models is also analyzed for the prediction of the severity level of COVID-19 patients using real-time IoT data and a dataset named 'COVID Symptoms Checker'. The proposed ensemble model combines random forest and extra tree classifiers using a soft voting criterion and achieves superior results with a 0.922 accuracy score. The use of IoT applications is found to support medical professionals in investigating the features of the contagious disease and support managing the COVID pandemic more efficiently.

AB This article proposes an adaptable path tracking control system, based on reinforcement learning (RL), for autonomous cars. A four-parameter controller shapes the behaviour of the vehicle to navigate lane changes and roundabouts. The tuning of the tracker uses an 'educated' Q-Learning algorithm to minimize the lateral and steering trajectory errors, this being a key contribution of this article. The CARLA (CAR Learning to Act) simulator was used both for training and testing. The results show the vehicle is able to adapt its behaviour to the different types of reference trajectories, navigating safely with low tracking errors. The use of a robot operating system (ROS) bridge between CARLA and the tracker (i) results in a realistic system, and (ii) simplifies the replacement of CARLA by a real vehicle, as in a hardware-in-the-loop system. Another contribution of this article is the framework for the dependability of the overall architecture based on stability results of non-smooth systems, presented at the end of this article.

AB The purpose of this research was to conduct a prediction human falling using deep learning and dimensionality reduction techniques in human activity recognition and behavioral prediction using smart watch and smart phone data. The deep learning-based techniques combined with multiple sensor data aim to classify daily activities. Previous work in human falling has focused on using multiple accelerometers placed on different parts of the body, with more recent work focused on sensors embedded in smartphones to classify activities. This research classifies activities from utilizing the data from the following sensors-accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. In addition to comparing these evaluation metrics, a comparison of each network's confusion matrix, feature importance and multisensory fusion analysis is performed-to evaluate which network best suits the data and successfully classifies the daily activities in question. Another intriguing aim of this research is to compare two data clustering techniques for visualizing the smart watch and smart phone dataset. This research aims to present the best visualization technique by conducting a comparative study on the two-visualization techniques. The result of this research found that all six-machine learning classification algorithms consistently outperformed State-of-the-Art baselines. Deep Neural Network (99.97% accuracy) and MLP (90.55%) accuracy performed excellently on the data, with very little misclassified instances. All six-classification algorithms produced more insightful, predictive results than existing baselines, while DNN successfully clustered and visualized the data. The results show that each algorithm is suited to the smart watch and smart phone dataset, with high performance results achieved throughout. The DNN model does not struggles in distinguishing between the falling activity and running activity with 7% of the activity misclassified. DNN outperforms MLP in this aspect as it misclassifies 3% of the activities between jogging and running. A solution to this would be to place an extra sensor on the thigh to distinguish between both activities. This sensor would lead to detection in a greater acceleration and range of motion in the upper thigh area when the subject is running in comparison to falling.

We provide this numerical treatment and simulation by using the finite element method (FEM). The proposed model is reduced to a set of algebraic equations using the FEM. The goal of this research is to stop and slow the spread of a sickness that is ravaging the globe. A susceptible person may also transfer immediately to the quarantined class after the exposed person has been quarantined or moved to one of the contaminated classes. This model was employed by the researchers to account for both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected people. The obtained findings are compared to those results by using the Runge-Kutta method of the fourth order (RK4). Finally, we calculate the residual error function of the approximation to validate the FEM.

AB Economic progress has been founded on environmental pressure by generating all types of environmental harm, such as an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and significant climate change, which has forced people to reflect. Building a people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated system to compile experience and lessons assists the government in formulating appropriate policies according to the meaning of the scientific development viewpoint. Based on the above, this research designs Cost-Benefit Decision Tree (CBDT) Algorithm for the economic protection development level using a Decision Tree (DT) and Ensemble Algorithm. In the design of ML Algorithm, this research work initially introduces the Decision Tree model for economic protection evaluation by emphasizing its value as a basic machine-learning framework for fully examining many aspects of economic protection development. Second, it investigates the critical role of Ensemble Algorithms, such as Random Forest in augmenting the capabilities of DT. Third, the paper focuses on the development of a complete Economic Protection Evaluation Index System using the DT Algorithm. To provide a robust, scientifically sound, and practicable framework for evaluating economic protection, this approach integrates scientificity, comparability, systematization, hierarchy, relative decoupling, and data availability principles. Finally, the study constructs the suggested ML Algorithm using the insights from the preceding parts. This algorithm combines the Decision Tree and Random Forest models to generate a single, effective tool for evaluating economic development levels. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed hybrid assessment technique is effective across several dimensions. The proposed CBDT demonstrated its capacity to adapt to changing data circumstances in evaluating low-carbon efficiency using real-world data from 30 major Chinese cities. Furthermore, the algorithm regularly beats rival techniques regarding efficiency improvements, with an average improvement of 12.5% across all cities. Notably, it outperforms other algorithms regarding computational efficiency, with a quicker execution time and an exceptional accuracy rate of 93.2%. The proposed ML Algorithm improves decision-making in the economic protection development level field by effectively balancing cost and benefit considerations. It will improve accuracy and efficiency to outperform existing approaches, thereby advancing economic protection evaluation and decision-making processes in this domain.

AB This paper introduces the Golf Sport Inspired Search (GSIS) algorithm as an evolutionary search method for numerical optimization. Each solution is generated with the aid of the step-length and search direction. The step-length is determined with the aid of the Tait's model of the trajectory of the golf ball, which is a physical model. The search direction is from the current position in the search space toward the position of a different individual or its reflected position. Such a direction determines the movement direction in the optimization process. A crossover operator is introduced to increase exploration at the starting and exploitation at the ending stages of the search. Performance of the GSIS is compared with many algorithms on 23 + 14 unconstrained classic functions, 29 functions of CEC 2017 benchmark suite and six constrained engineering design problems. Experiments indicate that with the aid of its cleverly designed operators, GSIS is able to produce promising results. Besides a cooperative game theoretic approach is introduced, which is able to measure the effectiveness of different operators in reducing the search cost. Such an approach can be used to measure the effectiveness of different operators that an evolutionary or swarm-intelligence algorithm owns.

ID SIMULATION
AB The development of the Internet and broadcasting technologies has made it possible to access a huge amount of multimedia content. Several cutting-edge technologies are working in parallel to make electronic gadgets automatic. The Internet of things (IoT) has become the main player in this race due to its significance in data collection and smart control. However, with rapid data generation from IoT devices, it has become difficult to manage such a huge volume of data and ensure its security and privacy. Among other fields, the music industry is also going to benefit from the power of these cutting-edge technologies, such as machine learning and IoT. Music can be created by utilizing several tools and instruments; the piano is one of them. The piano, as a representative of stringed instruments, is rapidly spreading to millions of households with its wide range, beautiful melodies, and strong aural complex. As existing keyword-based music recognition methods are increasingly limited in their application to large-scale song searches on the Internet, more and more researchers are turning to the study of content-based music recognition techniques. In this paper, we propose a musical identification system for piano performance evaluation by utilizing the power of IoT and support vector machine (SVM). The data from the piano was collected by utilizing different IoT devices and microphones. After the data was collected, we performed several preprocessing steps to prepare the collected data for SVM. To concentrate on the important information, key features were extracted from the input data, which include the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient and other piano-relevant features such as pedal usage patterns, pressure fluctuations, and keypress timings. These features were given as input to the SVM model for music recognition. The results of the experiment indicate that the average recognition rate of SVM for five songs is 61.2%, and the average recognition rate of HMM is 47.44%. The average recognition rate of SVM is 13.76% higher than that of HMM. Therefore, the SVM-based piano performance musical identification system is the basis of automatic music annotation and plays a very important role in the fields of computer music accompaniment, massive search of cover songs, and audio signal segmentation and matching.

AB Forests play an essential role in ensuring ecological balance and providing valuable resources. Evaluating their ecological effectiveness and economic value is vital for sustainable forest management. Due to the ecological benefits of the forest ecosystem, China has introduced reforms in its ecological system and incorporated them into its national economic accounting system. This research study selects different types of forests based on their locality and species. It formulates a classifier using Convolution Neural networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) data mining techniques. First, this paper briefly discusses data mining methods used to determine the impact of different factors on forest health, quality, and its importance in terrestrial ecology. Second, this research study designs a classifier for labeling forests according to their ecological and economic worth. A confusion matrix was used to ascertain the performance of the classifier. Third, it illustrates an index system for evaluating forest ecosystem service function value and explores dynamic characteristics of forest resource variation and the change process of the forest ecosystem. Finally, a statistical analysis is performed among the proposed study and related studies. The proposed study outperforms its predecessors and depicts that the proposed technique is more accurate than traditional systems. The study showed that the amount of nutrients accumulated by trees and the amount of polluted gas absorbed have doubled, and the growth rate of other functions has also increased by more than 70%. The average growth of forest ecological functions is 97.93%, significantly improving people's awareness of forest resource protection.

AB With the increasingly fierce market competition, enterprises hope to enhance their competitiveness through cooperation. In view of the uncertainty of coalitions formation in the real environment, the rational formulation of profit imputation principle is the basis for coalitions to maintain stability. This paper proposes a cooperative game with multi-granularity linguistic fuzzy coalitions to study the profit imputation. Firstly, a multi-granularity linguistic label set and a transformation function with preferred linguistic participation level are defined. Moreover, a new imputation of cooperative game with multi-granularity linguistic fuzzy coalitions is given, and its existence, uniqueness and other important properties are discussed. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the method is illustrated by applying the Solidarity value of cooperative game with multi-granularity linguistic fuzzy coalitions to collective forest land.

AB With the increasingly severe unemployment situation, the competition among undergraduates in employment is becoming more and more fierce, and the psychological pressure of undergraduates in employment is also growing. Undergraduates have a huge psychological gap because of the conflict between their ideals in employment and the specific social reality. This gap puts undergraduates in a state of psychological imbalance, often accompanied by anxiety, inferiority, self-denial, and other mentalities. It is very necessary to deeply explore the internal relationship between the position of the enterprise and the comprehensive quality of the employed students, and on this basis, it is necessary to construct an analysis mechanism for the matching of people and posts based on the portrait of students and the information of job requirements. Taking these points into account, in this study, we investigated the use of fuzzy clustering algorithms in the evaluation of psychological health in undergraduate students. Student psychological pressure is on the rise as a result of the increasingly competitive work landscape, prompting the development of novel early detection and intervention strategies. We proposed using fuzzy clustering methods to efficiently classify students according to their mental health. For this purpose, we collected many psychologically relevant characteristics, from different students using a SCL-90 symptom checklist. After the data collection, the preprocessing and feature extraction were carried out. The preprocessed data is then used for the students' psychological health analysis. The students are given degrees of membership based on their distance from cluster centroids, allowing them to simultaneously belong to many clusters (good, normal, mild abnormality, and severe abnormality). To maximize the performance of our proposed model to divide students into various mental health groups with flexible and exact membership degrees, we fine-tuned the membership function by iteratively adjusting parameters. The resulting our proposed method offers a flexible and precise way to grasp the mental health landscape, opening up a promising new direction for specialized assistance and interventions. Our research adds to the expanding body of knowledge on data-driven approaches to mental health evaluation by presenting a novel application of fuzzy clustering in the context of student well-being assessment.

DE Cross-modal retrieval; Deep hashing; Fine-grained similarity; Focal loss
AB Cross-modal hashing has attracted noticeable attention in the multimedia community. Two-stage methods often show impressive performance by first learning hash codes for data instances from different modalities, then learning hash functions that map the original multimodal data to the low dimensional hash codes. However, most existing two-stage methods can hardly obtain satisfactory hash codes at the first stage, as the commonly used coarse-grained similarity matrix fails to capture the differentiated similarity relationships between the original data instances. Besides, such methods cannot obtain satisfactory hash functions at the second stage, where the learning of hash functions is treated as a multi-binary classification problem. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage hashing method for cross-modal retrieval. At the first stage, we capture the differentiated similarity relationships between data instances by designing a fine-grained similarity matrix and add an Autoencoder to mine the semantic information. At the second stage, we introduce a similarity sensitivity learning strategy under the guidance of the similarity matrix to train the hash functions. This strategy makes the training process sensitive to the similar and hard pairs, boosting the retrieval performance. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.

AB Federated medical relation extraction enables multiple clients to train a deep network collaboratively without sharing their raw medical data. To handle the heterogeneous label distribution across clients, most of the existing works enforce regularization between local and global models during updating. In this paper, we propose the concept of major classifier vectors, which are a group of classifier vectors that characterize the representation space of relation classes well. They are obtained by comparing the inter-classifier similarity between clients, which is an ensembling method that avoids the bias introduced by weighted aggregation. We propose an algorithm named FedCMC, which restricts the updating of local models by contrasting with major classifier vectors to avoid overfitting to the local label distribution by comparison with major classifier vectors. Extensive experiments show that FedCMC outperforms the other state-of-the-art federated learning (FL) algorithms on three medical relation extraction datasets.

AB In order to solve the problem that traditional two-way decision based malicious code detection methods fail to consider the influence of decision making under the condition of insufficient information when facing complex and massive data in dynamic environment, this paper proposes a malicious code detection model based on sequential three-way decision. This model introduces sequential three-way decision into the domain of malicious code to avoid the risk of possible error detection due to insufficient information. In order to improve the overall performance of the detection model and eliminate the subjectivity of threshold selection, this paper designs a multi-objective sequential three-way decision model based on the above model, while considering the decision efficiency and decision accuracy of the model. In addition, the multi-objective optimization algorithm is used to solve the model. The simulation results show that the model not only guarantees the detection performance, but also improves the decision efficiency effectively. The real dynamic detection environment is better fitted.

However, there still exists the issue that the features of the same person are not close to each other in the feature space after asymmetric metric learning. The main reason is that the algorithm cannot overcome other interference except the view, such as the change in person's clothes and scenes, etc. Therefore, the traditional asymmetric metric learning still has the issue of distribution differences in feature space. To address this issue, we propose an asymmetric metric learning method based on distribution regularization constraints for unsupervised person re-identification. First, the JSTL technique pretrains the feature extraction network to obtain robust features. Then, a new asymmetric metric objective function is defined, that is, a distributed regularization constraint term is introduced into the traditional asymmetric metric learning objective function. This method not only alleviates the bias caused by different views, but also effectively overcomes the issue of low recognition accuracy caused by the interference of scenes and clothing changes other than views. Finally, the gradient descent method is used to optimize the objective function, and the optimal metric matrix is obtained by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem. Experiments are implemented on VIPeR, CUHK01, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-Reid, and MSMT17 datasets, and the results show that the Rank-1 values of the algorithm are 35.2%, 52.62%, 57.1%, 42.6% and 24.5%. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm gains significant improvement compared with the state-of-art unsupervised person re-identification algorithms.

AB Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) demonstrate low hardware and power consumption due to their inherent sparse spike-based computing characteristics, which is potential for deployment in resource-limited embedded devices. Nevertheless, the lack of efficient algorithms for compressing SNNs poses challenges when deploying large-scale SNNs on resource-limited devices. This work proposes an efficient SNN pruning and tuning method by incorporating the statistical characteristics of spike signals and weight sparsity, considering both network compression rate and performance. Channel balance factors determine which channels to prune in deep SNNs. These factors consider the scaling factors of batch normalization layers and the firing rate of spiking neurons to evaluate the importance of each channel. Then, a sparsity factor is applied during fine-tuning to prevent overfitting and reduce spiking, which restores performance loss caused by pruning. After using the proposed method, the number of parameters and FLOPs for the pruned 20-layer Resnet-SNNs are reduced by more than 60% and 80%, respectively, and the firing rate is reduced by 54.14% similar to 6.21% when the compression ratio varies from 10% similar to 70%. Meanwhile, the pruned Resnet-SNNs achieve competitive accuracies of 93.25%, 95.48%, and 73.60% on the CIFAR-10, DVS-Gesture, and DVS-CIFAR10 datasets, respectively, which are higher than the baseline (no compression SNNs) of 92.14%, 94.44%, and 72.60%. Our research has shown that deep SNNs have a significant potential for compression.

AB Deep neural networks have effectively processed substantial quantities of image, text, and speech data. However, they are susceptible to adversarial sample attacks, where slight perturbations modify the input to generate malicious outputs. These attacks pose a severe security risk to deep neural network systems. Prior methods for generating adversarial samples rely on objective L-p norm to measure the distance between original and adversarial samples, which can be easily detected by humans. Moreover, these attacks treat perturbations of different pixels equally without considering the sensitivity of the human eye to different pixels. To address these challenges, this paper proposes SenAttack, an adversarial attack method based on perturbation sensitivity and perceptual color distance. SenAttack evaluates perceptual similarity using the perceptual color distance and combines the perturbation sensitivity of image structural information as an additional term in the calculation of the perceptual color distance. Furthermore, it employs an adaptive parameter adjustment algorithm to optimize the iterative process. Experimental results demonstrate that SenAttack achieves a high success rate in white-box attacks on Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 models with few iterations. The average norm distance and perceptual color distance of the adversarial samples are reduced by over 10% and 50% respectively, significantly enhancing their imperceptibility. SenAttack also exhibits superior visual effects in high confidence scenarios and improved robustness against defense models with partial image compression. SenAttack provides a novel approach to adversarial attacks by considering the sensitivity of the human eye and employing perceptual color distance. The results highlight its effectiveness in generating imperceptible adversarial samples and its potential for enhancing the security of deep neural network systems.

ID NYSTROM METHOD
AB This paper presents a QR decomposition based low-rank approximation algorithm for training and prediction in Gaussian process regression. Conventional low-rank methods like FITC, Nystrom, etc., rely on low-rank approximations to the full kernel matrix that are derived from a set of representative data points. Training with FITC involves the selection of these representative points and is computationally intensive when the dimension of the dataset is large. Prediction accuracy of Nystrom suffers when the number of representative points is small or when the length scale is small. The algorithm proposed here uses the thin QR decomposition of the low-rank matrix used in the Nystrom approximation. We show that the marginal likelihood and its derivatives needed for training can be split into the subspace belonging to that approximation and its orthogonal complement. During prediction, we further restrict the target vectors into this subspace and thus eliminate the numerical error caused by very low noise variance. Use of the QR factorization improves the training and prediction performance. Experiments on real and synthetic data show that our approach is more accurate and faster than conventional methods. Our algorithm performs well at low length scales and achieves the prediction accuracy comparable to the full kernel matrix approach even for low rank approximations, without the need to optimize the representative points. This results in a simpler and faster approximation that could be used to scale Gaussian process regression to large datasets.

AB The optimal selection of pinning nodes for multi-agent flocking is a challenging NP-hard problem. Current pinning node selection strategies mainly rely on centrality measures of complex networks, which lack rigorous mathematical proof for effective flocking control. This paper proposes a pinning node selection strategy based on matrix eigenvalue theory. First, the effect of the pinning node on the eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is analyzed. Then, a synchronization index representing the topology uniformity of the multi-agent system is proposed to exert maximum influence on the system synchronizability. A practical optimal pinning node selection method based on the synchronization index is proposed and analyzed using the eigenvalue perturbation method. Finally, simulations demonstrate that the convergence rate of the system obtained using the optimal synchronizability pinning node selection method is better than that achieved with the maximum degree centrality node selection strategy.

AB This paper studies the synchronization and control of chaotic systems while proposing a novel chaotic-based path-tracking application for mobile robots (MRs) to ensure their safety and security. In security-based applications that use MRs, such as patrol MRs, the path of the MRs must be complex enough to prevent easy prediction. Multiple chaotic systems with a chaotic switching mechanism are introduced for secure path planning. The main challenges are that the dynamics of MRs are entirely unknown. The modeled dynamics of the MRs are unreliable in practice due to a broad range of uncertainties related to the parameters, operating conditions, environmental impacts, time delays, unmodeled frictions, noisy sensors, and faulty actuators. Also, the chaotic switching of reference signals between chaotic signals imposes a high dynamic perturbation. The main novelties are as follows: (1) a strong secure path is introduced for MRs. (2) A powerful fractional-order predictive controller using type-3 (T3) fuzzy-logic systems (FLSs) is developed. (3) The estimation and prediction errors of T3-FLSs are compensated by a designed parallel compensator. (4) T3-FLSs are tuned online, such that stability is ensured, and prediction accuracy is guaranteed. (5) The suggested scheme is implemented on a real-world MR, and the results demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. Also, in several simulations, the efficacy of the introduced controller is examined.

AB Recently, video summarization (VS) has emerged as one of the most effective tools for rapidly understanding video big data. Dictionary selection based on self-representation and sparse regularization is consistent with the requirement of VS, which aims to represent the original video with little reconstruction error by a small number of video frames. However, one crucial issue is that the existing methods mainly use a single view feature, which is not sufficient enough for acquiring the full pictorial details and affects the quality of the produced video summary. Although a few methods use more than one features, they only directly concatenate the features, which does not take advantage of the relationship of different features. Considering the complementarity of shallow and deep features, multiview feature co-factorization based dictionary selection for VS is proposed in this paper to use the common information of both view features for VS. Specifically, two view features are used to fully exploit the full pictorial information of video frames, then the common information of two different views is extracted through coupled matrix factorization to conduct the dictionary selection for VS. Experiments have been carried out on two benchmark datasets, and results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB One of the serious consequences of social media usage is fake information dissemination that locomotes society towards negativity. Existing solutions focus on supervised fake news detection models, which requires extensive labelled data. In this paper, we deal with two different problems of fake news detection such as (1) Detecting fake news with limited annotated data and (2) Interpretability of the proposed model on fake news detection. We address these issues by designing an Interpretable Self Ensembled Semi-Supervised Fake News Detection Model (I-(SFND)-F-2). In I-(SFND)-F-2, the model learns the enhanced representations of labelled and unlabelled fake news by incorporating an adaptive pseudo-labelling mechanism on unlabelled data. Moreover, interpretation of the model on text using the gradients improves the identification of essential words in the content of fake news. Based on the experimental findings, it is evident that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by approximately 5% in terms of accuracy when trained with only a limited amount of labeled data across different datasets.

AB With the advancement of interactive technology, alternative input modalities are often used, instead of conventional ones, to create intuitive, efficient, and user-friendly avenues of controlling and collaborating with robots. Researchers have examined the efficacy of natural interaction modalities such as gesture or voice in single and dual-task scenarios. These investigations have aimed to address the potential of the modalities on diverse applications encompassing activities like online shopping, precision agriculture, and mechanical component assembly, which involve tasks like object pointing and selection. This article aims to address the impact on user performance in a practical human-robot interaction application where a fixed-base robot is controlled through the utilization of natural alternative modalities. We explored this by investigating the impact of single-task and dual-task conditions on user performance for object picking and dropping. We undertook two user studies-one focusing on single-task scenarios, employing a fixed-base robot for object picking and dropping and the other encompassing dual-task conditions, utilizing a mobile robot for a driving scenario. We measured task completion times and estimated cognitive workload through the NASA Task Load Index (TLX), which offers a subjective, multidimensional scale measuring the perceived cognitive workload of a user. The studies revealed that the ranking of completion times for the alternative modalities remained consistent across both single-task and dual-task scenarios. However, the ranking based on perceived cognitive load was different. In the single-task study, the gesture-based modality resulted the highest TLX score, contrasting with the dual-task study, where the highest TLX score was associated with the eye gaze-based modality. Likewise, the speech-based modality achieved a lower TLX score compared to eye gaze and gesture in the single-task study, but its TLX score in the dual-task study was between gesture and eye gaze. These outcomes suggest that the efficacy of alternative modalities is contingent not only on user preferences but also on the specific situational context.

AB Personalized learning has gained significant attention in education as a means to cater to the diverse needs of learners and optimize educational outcomes. However, ensuring the efficiency of personalized learning remains a challenge. It requires the ability to accurately analyze and interpret vast amounts of data collected from learners. Traditional analytical approaches often struggle to handle the complexity and heterogeneity of this data, limiting the potential for personalized learning interventions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a personalized learning efficiency data analysis network (PLEDANet) based on machine learning. First, PLEDANet redesigns a convolutional neural network based on the ResNet structure. The network performs convolutions using multiple convolution kernels of different scales to extract diverse feature information from personalized learning efficiency data. To enhance the extraction and representation of fine-grained differentiated features, PLEDANet introduces a hybrid attention module to combine channel and spatial information among feature maps. Second, PLEDANet designs a hybrid loss function for model training, which consists of the AM-softmax loss and the Center loss. The former increases the inter-class distance of features by imposing a fixed angular margin, while the latter reduces the intra-class distance by constraining the samples and feature centers. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on PLEDANet. The experimental results validate the superiority of PLEDANet for personalized learning efficiency analysis.

AB The common law system is a legal system that values precedent, or previous court decisions, in the resolution of current cases. As the availability of legal documents in digital form has increased, it has become more difficult for legal professionals to manually identify relevant past cases due to the vast amount of data. Researchers have developed automated systems for determining the similarity between legal documents to address this issue. Our research explores various representations of a legal document and discusses a novel paragraph filtering process to identify key paragraphs using legal citation information to remove unnecessary text paragraphs without disturbing the concept of the legal document. State-of-the-art techniques like TF-IDF, BERT, Legal Bert, Doc2Vec, and Legal-longformer are used for the performance analysis of the proposed approach with document comparison. It has been shown that a model trained on the proposed filtered paragraphs can achieve better results than a model trained on the complete text and can also shorten the document by over 40%. The proposed filtering strategy could be helpful for models like BERT, where the maximum token length is fixed.

DE Multispectral image quality improvement; Meteorological information;
   Spectral-spatial fusion; Image degradation; Global iterative fusion
AB It has been proven that the refractive index is related to meteorological parameters in physics. The temperature changes the atmospheric and lens refractive indices, resulting in image degradation. Image restoration aims to recover the sharp image from the degraded images. It is also the basis of many computer vision tasks. A series of methods have been explored and used in this area. Sometimes, meteorological factors cause image degradation. Most of the existing image restoration methods do not consider meteorological factors' influence on image degradation. How meteorological factors affect image quality is not yet known. A multispectral image dataset with corresponding meteorological parameters is presented to solve the problem. We propose a novel multispectral image restoration algorithm using global iterative fusion. The proposed method firstly enhances image edge features through spatial filtering. Then, the Gaussian function is used to constrain the weights between each channel in the image. Finally, a global iterative fusion method is used to fuse image spatial and spectral features to obtain an improved multispectral image. The algorithm explores the impact of meteorological factors on image quality. It considers the impact of atmospheric factors on image quality and incorporates it into the image restoration process. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the method achieves favorable performance on real data. The proposed algorithm is also more robust than other state-of-the-art algorithms. In this paper, we present an algorithm for improving the quality of multispectral images. The proposed algorithm incorporates the influence of meteorological parameters into the image restoration method to better describe the relationship between different spectral channels. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Additionally, we investigate the impact of near-surface meteorological parameters on multispectral image quality.

ID REFINEMENT NETWORK; CONTEXT; INFORMATION
AB RGB depth (RGB-D) salient object detection (SOD) is a meaningful and challenging task, which has achieved good detection performance in dealing with simple scenes using convolutional neural networks, however, it cannot effectively handle scenes with complex contours of salient objects or similarly coloured salient objects and background. A novel end-to-end framework is proposed for RGB-D SOD, which comprises of four main components: the cross-modal attention feature enhancement (CMAFE) module, the multi-level contextual feature interaction (MLCFI) module, the boundary feature extraction (BFE) module, and the multi-level boundary attention guidance (MLBAG) module. The CMAFE module retains the more effective salient features by employing a dual-attention mechanism to filter noise from two modalities. In the MLCFI module, a shuffle operation is used for high-level and low-level channels to promote cross-channel information communication, and rich semantic information is extracted. The BFE module converts salient features into boundary features to generate boundary maps. The MLBAG module produces saliency maps by aggregating multi-level boundary saliency maps to guide cross-modal features in the decode stage. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public benchmark datasets, with the results demonstrating that the proposed model significantly outperforms 23 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD models with regards to multiple evaluation metrics.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB Optical neural networks (ONNs) hold great potential for faster and more energy-efficient information processing in coherent photonic circuits. To realize ONNs, linear combinations and nonlinear activation functions have to be implemented in an optical fashion. Optical nonlinearities are, however, still difficult to achieve, and existing designs are usually too inflexible to offer different activation functions as used in artificial neural networks. Herein, the nonlinear properties of the large and highly adaptive class of photoswitchable chemical compounds is made accessible as activation functions in ONNs by employing photo-induced isomerization in azobenzenes to steer activation behavior through nonlinear modulation of an information-carrying optical signal. The strength of the nonlinearity can be controlled by the chemical concentration while a physically motivated model describes the experimental data for systematically varied photoswitching parameters, resulting in a tunable yet interpretable activation function. Employing such an activation function in a neural network then allows to gauge its strength and perform established classification tasks. The work combines recent advances with photoswitchable chemical compounds and optical neural networks to enable control over the design of nonlinear activation functions, thus opening exciting perspectives for explaining the emergence of intelligent behavior in neural networks.

AB With the promotion and development of oversized data technology, many data analysis platforms based on super large data storage and computing frameworks have emerged in the industry. While the platforms with oversized economic data analysis combined with machine learning models are still relatively lacking. And oversized data also brings a new problem, that is the security of economic development. It is an important and difficult task to analyse and detect risks from oversized economic data. Based on machine learning, data analysis, economic market and other multidisciplinary fields, this paper proposes a machine learning method, which is a genetic algorithm (GA) based feature selection method: FSGA. This method abstracts every possible feature selection result into an individual in GA, generates a population through genetic operation, and measures the merits of the individual through fitness. In addition, this paper has conducted multitudinous simulation experiments on the GA-based FSGA method and the traditional LSTM data analysis method respectively. The accuracy rate and other indicators are obtained by comparing the training. The experimental results show that the GA-based FSGA machine learning method has higher prediction accuracy when analysing oversized economic data. And it is practical to accelerate the development of digital economy.

This paper introduces a novel approach that applies Fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) and Fuzzy TOPSIS MCDM methodology. A B2B e-commerce marketing store based in Hong Kong has created and implemented Smart-Quo, a pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses. After a six-month trial period, there has been a substantial advance in the effectiveness and efficiency of choosing prices for each product. The case study illustrates the viability and potential advantages of implementing artificial intelligence tools in marketing management in the digital era.

AB Healthcare is the foremost concern for any country. UN has also fixed 'good health' and well-being' as its third sustainable development goal. CoVID-19 era has shown the vulnerability of health infrastructure worldwide. As per WHO, aging population of the world would put enormous pressure on health infrastructure in coming decades. With lack of healthcare professionals and limited budget to achieve UNSDG goal-3, IoMT with its huge umbrella of medical services and applications can address these issues. 5G has been deployed in many countries and vision for 6G have been finalized by different research groups. 6G will help Internet of Medical Things to realize its full potential. In this work, an open '6G enabled IoMT' architecture has been presented. It can integrate a wide number of services. The limitations of 5G in catering to such a network are also highlighted. The challenges and open issues are presented in the light of services and applications that can be provided by the purposed architecture. A brief overview of 6G is also provided.

AB This paper develops new multiple classification approaches in a direct manner for high-dimensional multimodal data. Firstly, we construct multiple hyperplanes via the tensor multimodal product and design a novel piecewise quadratic loss function 'l(c)C ' in the soft-margin scheme to propose the multimodal support tensor machine model (MSTM). Furthermore, to alleviate the overfitting phenomenon in small-size sampling instances, we construct a multimodal sparsity constrained support tensor machine model (MSSTM) by subtly imposing the sparsity constraint on the decision variables of the dual problem. In addition, the Newton method and subspace Newton method are employed to solve the MSTM and MSSTM models from the dual perspective, taking advantage of the differentiation properties of 'l(c)C' and the hard-thresholding operator, respectively. Numerical experiments on four image datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods in terms of classification accuracy and training time for multiple classification.

AB Contrast enhancement plays a significant role in medical imaging technology for clinical diagnosis and observing the patient's health conditions. However, medical images may suffer from different degradations, such as poor visibility and low contrast, which are significant challenges for the automatic diagnosis of diseases. This article develops an ameliorated fuzzy transformation model to significantly enhance the contrast by adjusting the imbalanced intensity levels of medical images. The proposed optimal fuzzy intensification system (OFIS) utilizes the entire dynamic range by expanding the segmented intensity level of the input image. The fuzzy expansion process can enrich the diagnostic details of the processed image. The moth flame optimization is incorporated to optimize the gamma parameter to improve the clear visibility by adjusting the local contrast of the dark regions. Experiments on benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed method has superior performance in enhancing contrast and visibility of the local details of abnormalities in medical images compared with existing methods.

TI A Fusion-Based Dense Crowd Counting Method for Multi-Imaging Systems

DT Article
AB Dense crowd counting has become an essential technology for urban security management. The traditional crowd counting methods mainly apply to the scene with a single view and obvious features but cannot solve the problem with a large area and fuzzy crowd features. Therefore, this paper proposes a crowd counting method based on high and low view information fusion (HLIF) for large and complex scenes. First, a neural network based on an attention mechanism (AMNet) is established to obtain a global density map from a high view and crowd counts from a low view. Then, the temporal correlation and spatial complementarity between cameras are used to calibrate the overlap areas of the two images. Finally, the total number of people is calculated by combining the low-view crowd counts and the high-view density map. Compared to single-view crowd counting methods, HLIF is experimentally more accurate and has been successfully applied in practice.

AB Predicting human's gaze from egocentric videos serves as a critical role for human intention understanding in daily activities. In this paper, we present the first transformer-based model to address the challenging problem of egocentric gaze estimation. We observe that the connection between the global scene context and local visual information is vital for localizing the gaze fixation from egocentric video frames. To this end, we design the transformer encoder to embed the global context as one additional visual token and further propose a novel global-local correlation module to explicitly model the correlation of the global token and each local token. We validate our model on two egocentric video datasets - EGTEA Gaze + and Ego4D. Our detailed ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of our method. In addition, our approach exceeds the previous state-of-the-art model by a large margin. We also apply our model to a novel gaze saccade/fixation prediction task and the traditional action recognition problem. The consistent gains suggest the strong generalization capability of our model. We also provide additional visualizations to support our claim that global-local correlation serves a key representation for predicting gaze fixation from egocentric videos. More details can be found in our website (https://bolinlai.github.io/GLC-EgoGazeEst).

AB The human visual system has limited capacity in simultaneously processing multiple visual inputs. Consequently, humans rely on shifting their attention from one location to another. When viewing an image of complex scenes, psychology studies and behavioural observations show that humans prioritise and sequentially shift attention among multiple visual stimuli. In this paper, we propose to predict the saliency rank of multiple objects by inferring human attention shift. We first construct a new large-scale salient object ranking dataset, with the saliency rank of objects defined by the order that an observer attends to these objects via attention shift. We then propose a new deep learning-based model to leverage both bottom-up and top-down attention mechanisms for saliency rank prediction. Our model includes three novel modules: Spatial Mask Module (SMM), Selective Attention Module (SAM) and Salient Instance Edge Module (SIEM). SMM integrates bottom-up and semantic object properties to enhance contextual object features, from which SAM learns the dependencies between object features and image features for saliency reasoning. SIEM is designed to improve segmentation of salient objects, which helps further improve their rank predictions. Experimental results show that our proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performances on the salient object ranking task across multiple datasets. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SirisAvishek/Attention_Shift_Ranks.

TI Style-Hallucinated Dual Consistency Learning: A Unified Framework for
   Visual Domain Generalization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Domain generalization; Style variation; Consistency learning; Visual
   recognition
AB Domain shift widely exists in the visual world, while modern deep neural networks commonly suffer from severe performance degradation under domain shift due to poor generalization ability, which limits real-world applications. The domain shift mainly lies in the limited source environmental variations and the large distribution gap between source and unseen target data. To this end, we propose a unified framework, Style-HAllucinated Dual consistEncy learning (SHADE), to handle such domain shift in various visual tasks. Specifically, SHADE is constructed based on two consistency constraints, Style Consistency (SC) and Retrospection Consistency (RC). SC enriches the source situations and encourages the model to learn consistent representation across style-diversified samples. RC leverages general visual knowledge to prevent the model from overfitting to source data and thus largely keeps the representation consistent between the source and general visual models. Furthermore, we present a novel style hallucination module (SHM) to generate style-diversified samples that are essential to consistency learning. SHM selects basis styles from the source distribution, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and realistic samples during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our versatile SHADE can significantly enhance the generalization in various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, with different models, i.e., ConvNets and Transformer.

AB Higher education institutions place a lot of importance on their electronic learning systems. Educational institutions in Pakistan and other countries have adopted learning management systems (LMS) due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic scenario. The learning management system (LMS) establishes a digital learning environment where evaluation and user learning behavior must be carefully analyzed. The "quality of interaction" (QoI) of students is one of the main issues in LMS. Based on various usage matrices (such as the number of logins, clicks, total time spent on the LMS, and actions taken), a student's level of interaction with the LMS can be determined. QoI is an essential predictor of the accomplishment of students' final grades. Normally, to examine the effectiveness of LMS usage on students' learning performance, studies have relied on data gathered from users via surveys. However, the data gathered through surveys are typically associated with the risk of distortion or low quality. Therefore, in order to evaluate and predict the quality of interaction in terms of usage matrices, our proposed work analyzed data from the Moodle LMS at "Hazara University" (HU) for the law and English departments' courses. This research aims to assess and forecast the quality of student interaction within an LMS by analyzing usage metrics. Unlike traditional survey-based approaches, we explored the predictive performance of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Exponential Smoothing method (ETS), and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) methods to predict the weekly LMS usage factors of students. ARIMA and ETS produce better prediction results than LSTM for weekly predictions. Moreover, LSTM model training took considerable computational time for provided datasets.

ID TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE; CONSTITUTION
AB Sub-health state is a state of health and low quality between disease and health. The theoretical basis of children's sub-health is to start from the whole. The common clinical sub-health conditions cannot be explained by modern detection methods, and it can be screened and analyzed with the help of big data in medical informatization. The combination of "Internet + " and the health care model is an innovation in the construction of medical informatization. It can provide many considerate services to the masses in time and alleviate the anxiety of illness. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out the efficacy evaluation of children's sub-health from the perspective of medical information. Therefore, this paper completes the following work with the help of AI neural network: (1) This paper proposes an improved AlexNet network evaluation method based on attention mechanism. In this study, attention mechanism is added to the original AlexNet model to weight each channel of the feature layer. At the same time, we improve the large convolution kernel of the previous layers of the original AlexNet network and use batch normalization instead of the local response normalization (LRN) layer in the original model. (2) This paper proposes an evaluation method based on improved residual network, which improves the original residual block of the residual model and widens the residual block. The residual block can effectively reduce the amount of network parameters and improve the efficiency of network training. (3) This paper proposes an evaluation method of multi-scale feature fusion (MSFF). The features extracted from the improved AlexNet and residual network are fused and then evaluated. At this time, the training time is greatly shortened, and the accuracy is higher than that of single model.

AB Web video event mining based on cross-media fusion has become a research hotspot. However, each video is only described by a dozen noisy words, resulting in extremely unstable textual features. Moreover, different people might describe the same video with completely different words. Thus, the semantic association between textual and visual information would be much sparse, which brings great challenges to web video event mining based on cross-media associations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework to enrich the associations between near duplicate keyframes (NDK) and terms based on multiple semantic-paths embedding. After data preprocessing, we build a heterogeneous information network to establish associations among NDKs, terms and videos. Then, semantic-path walk strategy is designed to generate meaningful semantic-node sequences for embedding. Next, an embedding fusion method is proposed to predict the distribution characteristics of each term in NDKs. Finally, multiple correspondence analysis is used to mine web video events. Experiments on web videos from YouTube show that our proposed method performs better than several state-of-the-art baseline models, with an average F1 score improvement of 19-50%.

AB Artificial Intelligence is finding increased applications in communication networks. In particular, the field of text-to-Structured Query Language (SQL) translation has great potential to improve customer experience by allowing the querying of network performance databases using natural language. Such adoption, however, is challenging, in general. On one hand, live production systems may have databases with non-semantic table and column names, which makes natural language parsing and text-to-SQL translation difficult. On the other hand, noisy input texts may lead to the generation of incorrect queries. Moreover, inaccurate transcription of speech input into text may further aggravate the problem. Motivated by these aspects, we investigate the problem of natural language-based querying of network performance databases used by Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). In particular, we fine-tune a state-of-the-art model to translate natural language questions into appropriate SQL queries. In order to mitigate the problem of non-semantic names, we generate database views with semantic column names, based on the existing tables. In addition, we make domain-specific corrections in the text in order to help generate accurate queries. We also design the Natural Language Interface for Network Query (NLINQ) prototype for a real-life industrial WMN solution. The results of the performance evaluation indicate that natural language text can be translated into SQL queries with an accuracy of 89.021-92.663%, on average. Moreover, the average turnaround time of NLINQ ranges between 1.263-2.013 seconds. The results indicate that NLINQ is suitable for real-time, interactive querying of network performance databases.

AB The performance of any communication system heavily relies on the efficient routing of interventions. This article addresses the significant issue of routing protocol selection for optimal path determination in networks. Particularly, when wireless communication occurs among mobile nodes with limited resources, such as batteries, the routing problem becomes even more challenging. This article proposes the Fuzzy Control Energy Efficient (FCEE) routing protocol to overcome these challenges. The FCEE protocol combines the Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol with fuzzy logic techniques to enhance network lifetime and performance. The proposed approach introduces a memory-based channel integrated with fuzzy logic methodologies, which effectively restricts the forwarding of unnecessary broadcast packets based on the energy availability of the operating node. Through extensive simulations, demonstrate the promising capabilities of FCEE as a routing protocol for wireless mesh networks. To further assess the effectiveness of the FCEE protocol, the proposed article compares it with two existing routing protocols: AODV and Intelligent Routing AODV (IRAODV). The simulation results shows that the FCEE routing protocol significantly enhances the reliability of the conventional AODV, providing improved link connectivity and longer route lifetimes. Additionally, our proposed protocol enhances the quality of service (QoS) for mesh routing, with an average throughput of 351.374 (Kbps) compared to 90 (Kbps) for IRAODV and 39 (Kbps) for AODV. Moreover, FCEE exhibits superior energy efficiency with an average energy consumption of 14, while IRAODV and AODV consume 40 and 90 joules, respectively. In conclusion, the FCEE routing protocol demonstrates its potential to address the challenges of efficient routing in wireless mesh networks. By leveraging fuzzy logic and integrating it with AODV, FCEE enhances network lifetime, performance, and energy efficiency, making it a promising solution for future wireless communication systems.

AB Social media platforms have become inundated with offensive language. This issue must be addressed for the growth of online social networks (OSNs) and a healthy online environment. While significant research has been devoted to identifying toxic content in major languages like English, this remains an open area of research in the low-resource Pashto language. This study aims to develop an AI model for the automatic detection of offensive textual content in Pashto. To achieve this goal, we have developed a benchmark dataset called the Pashto Offensive Language Dataset (POLD), which comprises tweets collected from Twitter and manually classified into two categories: "offensive"and "not offensive". To discriminate these two categories, we investigated the classic deep learning classifiers based on neural networks, including CNNs and RNNs, using static word embeddings: Word2Vec, fastText, and GloVe as features. Furthermore, we examined two transfer learning approaches. In the first approach, we fine-tuned the pre-trained multilingual language model, XLM-R, using the POLD dataset, whereas, in the second approach, we trained a monolingual BERT model for Pashto from scratch using a custom-developed text corpus. Pashto BERT was then fine-tuned similarly to XLM-R. The performance of all the deep learning and transformer learning models was evaluated using the POLD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our pre-trained Pashto BERT model outperforms the other models, achieving an F1-score of 94.34% and an accuracy of 94.77%.

DE Electronic voting; Homomorphic encryption; Decentralization
ID SECURE
AB Compared with paper-based voting, electronic voting not only has advantages in storage and transmission, but also can solve the security problems that exist in traditional voting. However, in practice, most electronic voting faces the risk of voting failure due to malicious voting by voters or ballot tampering by attackers. To solve this problem, this article proposes an electronic voting scheme based on homomorphic encryption and decentralization, which uses the Paillier homomorphic encryption method to ensure that the voting results are not leaked until the election is over. In addition, the scheme applies signatures and two layers of encryption to the ballots. First, the ballot is homomorphically encrypted using the homomorphic public key; then, the voter uses the private key to sign the ballot; and finally, the ballot is encrypted using the public key of the counting center. By signing the ballots and encrypting them in two layers, the security of the ballots in the transmission process and the establishment of the decentralized scheme are guaranteed. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can guarantee the completeness, verifiability, anonymity, and uniqueness of the electronic voting scheme. The performance analysis shows that the computational efficiency of the proposed scheme is improved by about 66.7% compared with the Fan et al. scheme (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.10.016).

AB Vibrotactile feedback can support and enhance various musical learning processes of both children and adults, thus improving their musical experience. However, until now, to the best knowledge of the authors, only a few studies have focused on the auditory-tactile music perception in childhood. In this paper, we evaluate a bimodal auditory-tactile teaching approach for elementary school children. The experiment was designed based on the two-group-pretest-posttest design. Children allocated to the experimental group were subjected to auditory-tactile music training, while those allocated to the control-group completed the same training sessions stimulated by audio-only signals. Both groups received common, especially designed musical activities, divided into sixteen sessions. In order to evaluate the experimental procedure, children completed an auditory ability test in three different timepoints: before, half-way through, and at the end of the study. Data from 60 children were analyzed. The main aim of the study was to explore beat sensitivity in simple and complex music metrical structures and examine whether auditory-tactile stimulation could enhance the children's ability to recognize beat within various musical contexts. Results demonstrate notable performance improvements within the experimental group, suggesting that a multimodal music experience can improve beat induction abilities of both simple and complex meters for elementary school children.

ID TASK ALLOCATION
AB Great progress has been made in the domain of multi-agent reinforcement learning in recent years. Most work concentrates on solving a single task by learning the cooperative behaviors of agents. However, many real-world problems are normally composed of a set of subtasks in which the execution order follows a certain procedure. Cooperative behaviors should be learned on the premise that agents are first allocated to those subtasks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical framework for learning the dynamic allocation of agents among subtasks, as well as cooperative behaviors. We design networks corresponding to agents and subnetworks, respectively, which constitute the whole hierarchical network. For the upper layer, a novel allocation learning mechanism is devised to map an agent network to a subtask network. Each agent network could only be assigned to only one subtask network at each time step. For the lower layer, an action learning module is designed to compute appropriate actions for each agent with the allocation result. The agent networks together with the subtask networks are updated by a common reward obtained from the environment. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct experiments in two challenging environments, i.e., Google Research Football and SAVETHECITY. Empirical results show that our framework achieves much better performance than other recent methods.

AB Uncertainty pervades real life and supposes a challenge for all industrial processes as it makes it difficult to predict the outcome of otherwise risk-free activities. In particular, time deviation from projected objectives is one of the main sources of economic losses in manufacturing, not only for the delay in production but also for the energy consumed by the equipment during the additional unexpected time they have to work to complete their labour. In this work we deal with uncertainty in the flexible job shop, one of the foremost scheduling problems due to its practical applications. We show the importance of a good model to avoid introducing unwanted imprecision and producing artificially pessimistic solutions. In our model, the total energy is decomposed into the energy required by resources when they are actively processing an operation and the energy consumed by these resources simply for being switched on. We propose a set of metrics and carry out an extensive experimental analysis that compares our proposal with the more straightforward alternative that directly translates the deterministic model. We also define a local search neighbourhood and prove that it can reach an optimal solution starting from any other solution. Results show the superiority of the new model and the good performance of the new neighbourhood.

AB In the grey prediction, the GM(1, 1) model is an important type, but it sometimes shows big prediction errors. To improve the prediction precision of GM(1, 1) model, the paper makes improvements from the following three aspects: (1) to improve the data's adaptability to the model, the paper transforms the accumulated generating sequence of original time sequence; (2) to make the model meet the variation characteristics of data, the paper extends the grey action of traditional GM(1, 1) model; (3) to avoid big average simulation or prediction relative error of model, the paper considers the minimum of the maximum of the two errors as the optimization objective function. The new extended grey model is called the GM(1, 1, exp x sin, exp x cos) model. The paper uses an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for the parameter optimization of GM(1, 1, exp x sin, exp x cos) model and thus improves the model's convergence rate and precision. According to the model and method proposed, the paper builds a GM(1, 1, exp x sin, exp x cos) model for China's GDP per capita. Results show that the model has high precision.

AB The robotics field has witnessed a rapid increase in the popularity of soft pneumatic robots due to their adaptability to unstructured environments and safe human-robot interaction. However, many of them are still controlled by rigid solenoid valves and microcontrollers. Recent research works have introduced various electronics-free computational devices for soft robotic applications. Yet, connecting these individual components into pneumatic circuits still remains challenging. The manual circuit design, fabrication, and piping process can bring inefficient circuit layout, redundant tubing, unreliable fittings, and potentially human mistakes. This work presents an open-source toolbox for automatically designing pneumatic circuits for soft robotic applications. The toolbox takes the desired computation function along with some space constraints as inputs, and generates a 3D-printable file of a pneumatic circuit that can be fabricated and used directly. This is achieved by efficiently positioning the logic gates and air channels while considering the workspace constraints, fabrication limits, material cost, and system complexity. The versatility of the design automation algorithm has been tested with two different truth tables and six different workspaces. The work also showcases utilizing the toolbox to design a computational circuit that governs the movements of a soft robotic hand with four pneumatic actuators.

AB The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to its widespread adoption in various industries, enabling enhanced productivity and efficient services. Integrating IoT systems with existing enterprise application systems has become common practice. However, this integration necessitates reevaluating and reworking current Enterprise Architecture (EA) models and Expert Systems (ES) to accommodate IoT and cloud technologies. Enterprises must adopt a multifaceted view and automate various aspects, including operations, data management, and technology infrastructure. Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful IoT and smart automation tool within EA. Despite its potential, a need for dedicated work focuses on ML applications for IoT services and systems. With IoT being a significant field, analyzing IoT-generated data and IoT-based networks is crucial. Many studies have explored how ML can solve specific IoT-related challenges. These mutually reinforcing technologies allow IoT applications to leverage sensor data for ML model improvement, leading to enhanced IoT operations and practices. Furthermore, ML techniques empower IoT systems with knowledge and enable suspicious activity detection in smart systems and objects. This survey paper conducts a comprehensive study on the role of ML in IoT applications, particularly in the domains of automation and security. It provides an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art ML approaches within the context of IoT, highlighting their contributions, challenges, and potential applications.

AB Unification of classification and regression is a major challenge in machine learning and has attracted increasing attentions from researchers. In this article, we present a new idea for this challenge, where we convert the classification problem into a regression problem, and then use the methods in regression to solve the problem in classification. To this end, we leverage the widely used maximum margin classification algorithm and its typical representative, support vector machine (SVM). More specifically, we convert SVM into a piecewise linear regression task and propose a regression-based SVM (RBSVM) hyperparameter learning algorithm, where regression methods are used to solve several key problems in classification, such as learning of hyperparameters, calculation of prediction probabilities, and measurement of model uncertainty. To analyze the uncertainty of the model, we propose a new concept of model entropy, where the leave-one-out prediction probability of each sample is converted into entropy, and then used to quantify the uncertainty of the model. The model entropy is different from the classification margin, in the sense that it considers the distribution of all samples, not just the support vectors. Therefore, it can assess the uncertainty of the model more accurately than the classification margin. In the case of the same classification margin, the farther the sample distribution is from the classification hyperplane, the lower the model entropy. Experiments show that our algorithm (RBSVM) provides higher prediction accuracy and lower model uncertainty, when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, such as Bayesian hyperparameter search and gradient-based hyperparameter learning algorithms.

AB Graph convolutional network (GCN) has gained widespread attention in semisupervised classification tasks. Recent studies show that GCN-based methods have achieved decent performance in numerous fields. However, most of the existing methods generally adopted a fixed graph that cannot dynamically capture both local and global relationships. This is because the hidden and important relationships may not be directed exhibited in the fixed structure, causing the degraded performance of semisupervised classification tasks. Moreover, the missing and noisy data yielded by the fixed graph may result in wrong connections, thereby disturbing the representation learning process. To cope with these issues, this article proposes a learnable GCN-based framework, aiming to obtain the optimal graph structures by jointly integrating graph learning and feature propagation in a unified network. Besides, to capture the optimal graph representations, this article designs dual-GCN-based meta-channels to simultaneously explore local and global relations during the training process. To minimize the interference of the noisy data, a semisupervised graph information bottleneck (SGIB) is introduced to conduct the graph structural learning (GSL) for acquiring the minimal sufficient representations. Concretely, SGIB aims to maximize the mutual information of both the same and different meta-channels by designing the constraints between them, thereby improving the node classification performance in the downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fixed-structure graphs.

AB In this article, we investigate the boundedness and convergence of the online gradient method with the smoothing group $L_{1/2}$ regularization for the sigma-pi-sigma neural network (SPSNN). This enhances the sparseness of the network and improves its generalization ability. For the original group L-1/2 regularization, the error function is nonconvex and nonsmooth, which can cause oscillation of the error function. To ameliorate this drawback, we propose a simple and effective smoothing technique, which can effectively eliminate the deficiency of the original group L-1/2 regularization. The group L-1/2 regularization effectively optimizes the network structure from two aspects redundant hidden nodes tending to zero and redundant weights of surviving hidden nodes in the network tending to zero. This article shows the strong and weak convergence results for the proposed method and proves the boundedness of weights. Experiment results clearly demonstrate the capability of the proposed method and the effectiveness of redundancy control. The simulation results are observed to support the theoretical results.

AB Although quality-related process monitoring has achieved the great progress, scarce works consider the detection of quality-related incipient faults. Partial least square (PLS) and its variants only focus on faults with larger magnitudes. In this article, a deep quality monitoring network (DQMNet) for quality-related incipient fault detection is developed. DQMNet includes the feature input layer, feature extraction layers, and the output layer. In the feature input layer, collected variables are divided according to quality variables, and then, features are extracted, respectively, through base detectors. For the feature extraction layers, singular values (SVs) of sliding-window patches and principal component analysis (PCA) are adopted to mine the hidden information layer by layer. For the output layer, statistics are constructed from quality-related/unrelated feature matrix through Bayesian inference. The superiority of DQMNet is demonstrated by a numerical simulation and the benchmark data of Tennessee Eastman process (TEP).

AB This article aims to solve the optimal tracking problem (OTP) for a class of discrete-time (DT) nonlinear systems with completely unknown dynamics. A novel data-driven deterministic approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is proposed to solve this kind of problem with only input-output (I/O) data. The proposed algorithm has two advantages compared to existing data-driven deterministic ADP algorithms for the OTP. First, our algorithm can guarantee optimality while achieving better performance in the aspects of time-saving and robustness to data. Second, the near-optimal control policy learned by our algorithm can be implemented without considering expected control and enable the system states to track the user-specified reference signals. Therefore, the tracking performance is guaranteed while simplifying the algorithm implementation. Furthermore, the convergence and stability of the proposed algorithm are strictly proved through theoretical analysis, in which the errors caused by neural networks (NNs) are considered. At the end of this article, the developed algorithm is compared with two representative deterministic ADP algorithms through a numerical example and applied to solve the tracking problem for a two-link robotic manipulator. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed algorithm.

AB Reservoir computing is a highly efficient machine learning framework for processing temporal data by extracting input features and mapping them into higher dimensional spaces. Physical reservoirs have been realized using spintronic oscillators, atomic switch networks, volatile memristors, etc. However, these devices are intrinsically energy-dissipative due to their resistive nature, increasing their power consumption. Therefore, memcapacitive devices can provide a more energy-efficient approach. Herein, volatile biomembrane-based memcapacitors are leveraged as reservoirs to solve classification tasks and process time series in simulation and experimentally. This system achieves a 99.6% accuracy for spoken-digit classification and a normalized mean square error of 7.81x10-4$7.81 \times \left(10\right)<^>{- 4}$ in a second-order nonlinear regression task. Furthermore, to showcase the device's real-time temporal data processing capability, a 100% accuracy for an epilepsy detection problem is achieved. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that each memcapacitor consumes an average of 41.5 fJ of energy per spike, regardless of the selected input voltage pulse width, while maintaining an average power of 415 fW for a pulse width of 100 ms, orders of magnitude lower than those achieved by state-of-the-art devices. Lastly, it is believed that the biocompatible, soft nature of our memcapacitor renders it highly suitable for computing applications in biological environments.
   Reservoir computing is a highly efficient algorithm for processing temporal datasets by extracting input features and projecting them into a high-dimensional space. Biomembrane-based memcapacitors can emulate key synaptic functions due to their volatile memcapacitive property, enabling learning and computation. Herein, a biomembrane-based memcapacitive reservoir system is presented to solve classification and time-series prediction tasks, consuming only 41.5 fJ per spike.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Predicting future trajectories of pairwise traffic agents in highly interactive scenarios, such as cut-in, yielding, and merging, is challenging for autonomous driving. The existing works either treat such a problem as a marginal prediction task or perform single-axis factorized joint prediction, where the former strategy produces individual predictions without considering future interaction, while the latter strategy conducts conditional trajectory-oriented prediction via agentwise interaction or achieves conditional rollout-oriented prediction via timewise interaction. In this article, we propose a novel double-axis factorized joint prediction pipeline, namely, conditional goal-oriented trajectory prediction (CGTP) framework, which models future interaction both along the agent and time axes to achieve goal and trajectory interactive prediction. First, a goals-of-interest network (GoINet) is designed to extract fine-grained features of goal candidates via hierarchical vectorized representation. Furthermore, we propose a conditional goal prediction network (CGPNet) to produce multimodal goal pairs in an agentwise conditional manner, along with a newly designed goal interactive loss to better learn the joint distribution of the intermediate interpretable modes. Explicitly guided by the goal-pair predictions, we propose a goal-oriented trajectory rollout network (GTRNet) to predict scene-compliant trajectory pairs via timewise interactive rollouts. Extensive experimental results confirm that the proposed CGTP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction models on the Waymo open motion dataset (WOMD), Argoverse motion forecasting dataset, and In-house cut-in dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/LiDinga/CGTP/.

AB Solving constrained optimization problems that require processing large-scale data is of significant value in practical applications, and such problems can be described as the minimization of a finite-sum of local convex functions. Many existing works addressing constrained optimization problems have achieved a linear convergence rate to the exact optimal solution if the constant step-size was sufficiently small. However, they still suffer from low computational efficiency because of the computation of the local batch gradients at each iteration. Considering high computational efficiency to resolve the constrained optimization problems, we introduce the projection operator and variance-reduction technique to propose a novel projected decentralized variance-reduction algorithm, namely P-DVR, to tackle the constrained optimization problem subject to a closed convex set. Theoretical analysis shows that if the local function is strongly convex and smooth, the P-DVR algorithm can converge to the exact optimal solution at a linear convergence rate O(lambda(k)) with a sufficiently small step-size, where 0<lambda<1. Finally, we experimentally validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, i.e., the algorithm possesses high computational efficiency and exact convergence.

ID CLASSIFICATION; DATABASE
AB Nowadays, multimedia content, such as photographs and movies, is ingrained in every aspect of human lives and has become a vital component of their entertainment. Multimedia content, such as videos or movie clips, is typically created with the intent to evoke certain feelings or emotions in viewers. Thus, by examining the viewer's cognitive state while watching such content, its affectiveness can be evaluated. Considering the emotional aspect of videos, in this paper, a deep learning-based paradigm for affective tagging of video clips is proposed, in which participants' irrational EEG responses are used to examine how people perceive videos. The information behind different brain regions, frequency waves, and connections among them play an important role in understanding a human's cognitive state. Thus, here a contribution is made toward the effective modeling of EEG signals through two different representations, i.e., spatial feature matrix and combined power spectral density maps. The proposed feature representations highlight the spatial features of EEG signals and are therefore used to train a convolution neural network model for implicit tagging of two categories of videos in the Arousal domain, i.e., "Low Arousal" and "High Arousal." The arousal emotional space represents the excitement level of the viewer; thus, this domain is selected to analyze the viewer's engagement while watching video clips. The proposed model is developed using the EEG data taken from publicly available datasets "AMIGOS" and "DREAMER." The model is tested using two different approaches, i.e., single-subject classification and multi-subject classification, and an average accuracy of 90%-95% and 90%-93% is achieved, respectively. The simulations presented in this paper show the pioneering applicability of the proposed framework for the development of brain-computer interface (BCI) devices for affective tagging of videos.

AB Recent years have witnessed many applications of wearable sensor technology and machine learning on smart sports training, e.g., basketball. For rookie players, the fundamental skills are very important and can be improved using a scientific auxiliary training system, the core of which is human activity recognition (HAR) technique. For basketball players, one complete action is usually performed in a moment with significant dynamics and high-frequency spikes or noise. So, extracting meaningful features from intricate sensor signals is one of the important prerequisites. Besides, to improve the recognition accuracy, it is challenging to empirically determine an ideal feature subset out of the extracted high-dimensional features for particular types of basketball activities, which is essentially an NP-hard optimization problem. To address the above issues, we propose a smart activity recognition system hybridizing an IoT-based edge-cloud system and a swarm intelligence-based feature selection algorithm, named Adaptive Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (ABPSO). The devices can automatically collect and process basketball players' action signals. A comprehensive feature set with 300 features that can cover and capture the characteristics of different activities is established. Then, ABPSO with global search ability is able to identify the optimal feature subset combined with classifiers for accurate activity recognition. Thanks to ABPSO, the size of machine learning model and the amount of transmitted data is largely reduced, which makes it well compatible for IoT-based applications. Experiments performed on nine human subjects demonstrate that ABPSO can achieve accuracy of 97.26% for five fundamental activities on average, which outperforms five state-of-the-art FS algorithms, two classic filter-based FS methods and one deep learning based method.

AB We rethink the traditional reinforcement learning approach, which is based on optimizing over feedback policies, and propose a new framework that optimizes over feedforward inputs instead. This not only mitigates the risk of destabilizing the system during training but also reduces the bulk of the learning to a supervised learning task. As a result, efficient and well-understood supervised learning techniques can be applied and are tuned using a validation data set. The labels are generated with a variant of iterative learning control, which also includes prior knowledge about the underlying dynamics. Our framework is applied for intercepting and returning ping-pong balls that are played to a four-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm in real-world experiments. The robot arm is driven by pneumatic artificial muscles, which makes the control and learning tasks challenging. We highlight the potential of our framework by comparing it to a reinforcement learning approach that optimizes over feedback policies. We find that our framework achieves a higher success rate for the returns (100% vs. 96%, on 107 consecutive trials, see https://youtu.be/kR9jowEH7PY) while requiring only about one tenth of the samples during training. We also find that our approach is able to deal with a variant of different incoming trajectories.

TI Knowledge Graph Alignment Under Scarce Supervision: A General Framework

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Active learning (AL); contrastive learning (CL); entity alignment (EA);
   knowledge graph alignment (KGA)
AB Over recent years, a number of knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged. Nevertheless, a KG can never reach full completeness. A viable approach to increase the coverage of a KG is KG alignment (KGA). The majority of previous efforts merely focus on the matching between entities, while largely neglect relations. Besides, they heavily rely on labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. To address these issues, in this work, we put forward a general framework to simultaneously align entities and relations under scarce supervision. Our proposal consists of two main components, relation-enhanced active instance selection (RAS), and cross-view contrastive learning (CCL). RAS aims to select the most valuable instances to be labeled with the guidance of relations, while CCL contrasts cross-view representations to augment scarce supervision signals. Our proposal is agnostic to the underlying entity and relation alignment models, and can be used to improve their performance under limited supervision. We conduct experiments on a wide range of popular KG pairs, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model and its components can consistently boost the alignment performance under scarce supervision.

AB This article solves the entry capture problem (ECP) such that for any initial tracking error, it can be regulated into the prescribed performance constraints within a user-given time. The challenge lies in how to remove the initial condition limitation and to handle the ECP for nonlinear systems under unknown control directions and asymmetric performance constraints. For better tracking performance, we propose a unified tunnel prescribed performance (TPP) providing strict and tight allowable set. With the aid of a scaling function, error self-tuning functions (ESFs) are then developed to make the control scheme suitable to any initial condition (including the initial constraint violation), where the initial values of ESFs always satisfy performance constraints. In lieu of the Nussbaum technique, an orientation function is introduced to deal with unknown control directions while such way is capable of reducing the control peaking problem. Using ESFs, together with TPP and an orientation function, the resulted tunnel prescribed control (TPC) leads to a solution for the underlying ECP, which also exhibits a low complexity level since no command filters or dynamic surface control is required. Finally, simulation results are provided to further demonstrate these theoretical findings.

AB As one of the most popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) has been widely studied in machine learning community and applied to many scientific applications. Traditional LDA minimizes the ratio of squared l(2) norms, which is vulnerable to the adversarial examples. In recent studies, many l(1) -norm-based robust dimensionality reduction methods are proposed to improve the robustness of model. However, due to the difficulty of l(1) -norm ratio optimization and weakness on defending a large number of adversarial examples, so far, scarce works have been proposed to utilize sparsity-inducing norms for LDA objective. In this article, we propose a novel robust discriminative projections learning (rDPL) method based on the l(1,2) -norm trace-ratio minimization optimization algorithm. Minimizing the l(1,2) -norm ratio problem directly is a much more challenging problem than the traditional methods, and there is no existing optimization algorithm to solve such nonsmooth terms ratio problem. We derive a new efficient algorithm to solve this challenging problem and provide a theoretical analysis on the convergence of our algorithm. The proposed algorithm is easy to implement and converges fast in practice. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and several real benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method on defending the adversarial patch attack by comparison with many state-of-the-art robust dimensionality reduction methods.

AB This paper presents a textile defect detection method that utilizes a multi-proportion spatial attention mechanism and channel memory feature fusion network by addressing the difficulties presented by complicated shapes and large size variations. In particular, a multi-proportion spatial attention mechanism (MPAM) is introduced, which employs multi-proportion convolution to improve the backbone network's capacity to detect non-uniform structural defects. Additionally, the generality and adaptability of the model are enhanced by a multi-scale spatial pyramid pooling structure (MS-SPP). Second, a channel attention mechanism-based memory feature fusion network is developed, which incorporates channel attention to adaptive weight the feature channels, focusing on crucial information channels to efficiently fuse contextual features and enhance the model's memory capacity. Finally, a novel efficient Wise-IoU (EWIoU) loss function is proposed, which utilizes a dynamic non-monotonic focusing mechanism to increase the penalty on distance measurement, thus enhancing the model's detection performance. Experiment findings on the ZJU-Leaper and Tianchi textile datasets reveal that compared to the YOLOv7 baseline, the method in this paper has an increase of 6.5 and 2 percentage points, respectively, and the detection accuracy is better than most existing networks.

ID NETWORK; GENDER
AB Speech emotion recognition has lots of applications such as human-computer interaction and health management. The current methods are challenged with the problems of fuzzy decision boundary and imbalance between difficult and easy samples in the training data. This paper first proposes an additive angle penalty focus loss function (APFL), which strictly refines the fuzzy decision boundary by introducing angle penalty factors to improve the compactness within the class and enlarge the distance between classes. It also assigns the larger loss to difficult samples to make the model pay more attention to them, as they are easily misclassified. Simultaneously, due to the lack of training samples, the framework of multimodal and multitask learning with APFL is further proposed, which extracts spectrogram features by deep neural network, text features by the pretrained language model, and audio features by the pretrained sound model. It uses the gender recognition as an auxiliary task. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss function and framework.

AB Epilepsy is one kind of neurological disease characterized by recurring seizures. Recurrent seizures can cause ongoing negative mental and cognitive damage to the patient. Therefore, timely diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy are crucial for patients. Manual electroencephalography (EEG) signals analysis is time and energy consuming, making automatic detection using EEG signals particularly important. Many deep learning algorithms have thus been proposed to detect seizures. These methods rely on expensive and bulky hardware, which makes them unsuitable for deployment on devices with limited resources due to their high demands on computer resources. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight neural network for seizure detection using pure convolutions, which is composed of inverted residual structure and multi-scale channel attention mechanism. Compared with other methods, our approach significantly reduces the computational complexity, making it possible to deploy on low-cost portable devices for seizures detection. We conduct experiments on the CHB-MIT dataset and achieves 98.7% accuracy, 98.3% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity with 2.68M multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) and only 88K parameters.

   Online recruitment; Multi-semantic
AB Most existing recommendation research has been concentrated on unidirectional recommendation, i.e., only recommending items to users. However, the platform needs to achieve bi-directional recommendation in many real-world scenarios. For example, in an online recruitment scenario, the recommender system not only needs to recommend positions to candidates, but also recommend candidates to enterprises. In this paper, we develop a new bi-directional recommendation model for online recruitment termed (BiMuF) Bi-directional recommendation with Multi-semantic Filter. In BiMuF, an encoder component is utilized to learn the text embeddings, a multi-semantic filter component is designed to capture important graph representation, and a graph learning component is designed to learn the graph embeddings. In addition, a multi-task learning framework is designed to achieve bi-directional recommendations. In the multi-task learning framework, we share text embeddings and graph embeddings to alleviate the problems of data sparsity, data asymmetry, and feature generalization in online recruitment. Moreover, we conduct three new datasets based on a technology supply and demand docking platform namely South China Technology Commercialization Center, and three new datasets in job recruitment scenario namely Computer Technology-Related Job Recruitment. Extensive experiments in the real-world tasks show that BiMuF outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, verifying the effectiveness of the designs of our model. The code and the latter datasets are available at https://github.com/allminerlab.

AB In this article, a distributed learning-based fault accommodation scheme is proposed for a class of nonlinear interconnected systems under event-triggered communication of control and measurement signals. Process faults occurring in the local dynamics and/or propagated from interconnected neighboring subsystems are considered. An event-triggered nominal control law is used for each subsystem before detecting any fault occurrence in its dynamics. After fault detection, the corresponding event-triggered fault accommodation law is utilized to reconfigure the nominal control law with a neural-network-based adaptive learning scheme employed to estimate an ideal fault-tolerant control function online. Under the asynchronous controller reconfiguration mechanism for each subsystem, the closed-loop stability of the interconnected systems in different operating modes with the proposed event-triggered learning-based fault accommodation scheme is rigorously analyzed with the explicit stabilization condition and state upper bound derived in terms of event-triggering parameters, and the Zeno behavior is shown to be excluded. An interconnected inverted pendulum system is used to illustrate the proposed fault accommodation scheme.

AB Stability is a central issue in the study of dynamical systems, and quaternion-valued neural networks (QVNNs) perform well in handling the problem involving high-dimension date. The paper is dedicated to investigating the stability problem of QVNNs with neutral delay. In order to accurately estimate the derivative of Lyapunov functional, both reciprocally convex inequality and Wirtinger-based inequality are extended to the quaternion domain. And the direct quaternion method is used to analyze the quaternion-valued neutral neural networks (QVNNNs). Based on the generalized inequalities, the existence, uniqueness, and global stability criteria for QVNNS with several freedom matrices are derived. Concision and compact stability criteria of QVNNNs are established in the form of quaternion-valued LMIs, and the correctness of the theoretical results was verified through a numerical example.

AB Time series anomaly detection is an important field of data science. Statistical, distance-based, clustering-based, or density-based approaches can detect anomalies. Generally, distance-based methods are relatively straightforward, but the method's effectiveness depends on how well they handle the distribution of data points. To address the challenge, a preprocessing step is used to convert the underlying time series into a more useful format. In this paper, a novel clustering-based representation of time series is proposed. This representation is then used to compute anomaly scores and detect anomalies. Experimental studies on synthetic and real datasets show that proposed method outperforms other methods by up to 75% for five standard performance metrics.

AB The rapid progress of AI impacts various areas of life, including toxicology, and promises a major role for AI in future risk assessments. Toxicology has shifted from a purely empirical science focused on observing chemical exposure outcomes to a data-rich field ripe for AI integration. AI methods are well-suited to handling and integrating large, diverse data volumes - a key challenge in modern toxicology. Additionally, AI enables Predictive Toxicology, as demonstrated by the automated read-across tool RASAR that achieved 87% balanced accuracy across nine OECD tests and 190,000 chemicals, outperforming animal test reproducibility. AI's ability to handle big data and provide probabilistic outputs facilitates probabilistic risk assessment. Rather than just replicating human skills at larger scales, AI should be viewed as a transformative technology. Despite potential challenges, like model black-boxing and dataset biases, explainable AI (xAI) is emerging to address these issues.

AB Following sustainability in manufacturing, the machining chain can be optimized by either reducing the time and energy consumption of each operation or eliminating the unnecessary operations subjected to keeping the quality of the final product as consistent. However, the roadblock in designing an optimum machining chain is lack of prediction tool to interact between the included operations. In this paper, an integrated algorithm is developed to simulate the surface roughness generation and following modification caused by milling and burnishing, respectively. Predict the surface roughness generation by milling process and its alternation after burnishing. The algorithm works on the basis of clouds of points which were generated in the engagement region of tool and workpiece and their transformation from tool to workpiece coordinate systems. Moreover, some mechanical attributes of the process regarding effect of surface work hardening and elastic rebound were added to the algorithm to enhance the accuracy of simulation. To verify the results, a series of burnishing experiments with multi-roller rotary tool have been carried out on the surface of the finish-milled samples and the surface roughness change was taken into investigation. The obtained results showed that by applying the work hardening and springback effect to predictive algorithm the prediction accuracy of roughness at submicron level enhances up to 50%. It was also found that the most influential parameters influencing the surface roughness after milling-burnishing sequence are milled surface roughness, burnishing force and pass number. In addition, results showed that applying burnishing after rough machining consumes lots of energy to achieve nanoscale surface finish. Accordingly, the sequence of rough-milling, finish-milling and burnishing results in achieving sound surface finish within significantly shorter period of time and applied force.

AB Precise selective cooling control of work roll can significantly improve the cold rolled strip flatness in steel manufacturing industry. To improve the control accuracy of the coolant output of selective work roll cooling control system, a machine learning (ML) algorithm with differential evolution-gray wolf algorithm optimization support vector machine regression (DE-GWO-SVR) model has been proposed for the first time in this study. This model combines the differential evolution (DE) with grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) to improve the optimization performance of the algorithm. Then, the SVR model parameters are optimized with differential evolutionary gray wolf hybrid algorithm (DE-GWO) to improve the regression accuracy. Finally, the influences of data normalization methods and the selection of SVR kernel functions were systematically investigated. Compared with the test results of other regression models, the evaluation index R2 based on the DE-GWO-SVR model is greater and the RMSE, MAE, and MAPE are smaller. The DE-GWO-SVR model performs the best, with a higher regression accuracy than the other regression models. Besides, it has been successfully applied to a 1450 mm five-stand industrial cold rolling mill. The model has higher control accuracy for the thermal crown of the work roll and better control effect for the flatness deviation of the strip steel. This study provides a novel strategy with a help of ML algorithm to effectively improve the flatness quality of cold rolled strips by optimizing the selective cooling control of work roll, which exhibits a great practical application potential in steel manufacturing.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become increasingly prevalent in image processing applications. However, DCNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are generated by adding imperceptible perturbations to the input that can cause the network to misclassify the image. In this study, we propose a black-box transferable adversarial attack method. The goal is to enhance the understanding of the vulnerability of these networks. Meanwhile, it could help develop more robust defenses against such attacks. This attack efficiently generates adversarial examples by manipulating the singular value matrix instead of directly perturbing pixels with complex noise. We utilize soft actor-critic to explore an optimal perturbation strategy. We perform extensive evaluations with VOC 2012, MS Coco 2017 datasets on object detection models, the MNIST dataset on image classification models, as well as the TT-100K dataset on a real-world case study to evaluate the proposed singular value manipulating attack (SVMA). Comparison results demonstrate that SVMA achieves a consistent query efficiency and attack ability on both one-stage detector Yolo and two-stage detector Faster R-CNN. Additionally, our case study demonstrates the adversarial examples of SVMA are effective in real-world scenarios. In the end, we propose a defense against such attacks.

AB The synchronization control problem of discrete-time switched neural networks is considered in this paper. Wherein, the switchings among subsystems are described by the mode-dependent persistent dwell-time switching rule. Due to restricted network bandwidth resources, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced to alleviate the frequency of data transmission. In addition, the activation function dividing method is utilized to make the result less conservative. Then, using Lyapunov stability theory, several sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure that the synchronization error system can achieve mean-square exponential stability and meet the specified passive performance under DoS attacks. Based on these criteria, the concrete form of controller gain is solved. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the rationality and superiority of the proposed method.

AB IntroductionAutonomous mobile robot encompasses modules such as perception, path planning, decision-making, and control. Among these modules, path planning serves as a prerequisite for mobile robots to accomplish tasks. Enhancing path planning capability of mobile robots can effectively save costs, reduce energy consumption, and improve work efficiency. The primary slime mold algorithm (SMA) exhibits characteristics such as a reduced number of parameters, strong robustness, and a relatively high level of exploratory ability. SMA performs well in path planning for mobile robots. However, it is prone to local optimization and lacks dynamic obstacle avoidance, making it less effective in real-world settings.MethodsThis paper presents an enhanced SMA (ESMA) path-planning algorithm for mobile robots. The ESMA algorithm incorporates adaptive techniques to enhance global search capabilities and integrates an artificial potential field to improve dynamic obstacle avoidance.Results and discussionCompared to the SMA algorithm, the SMA-AGDE algorithm, which combines the Adaptive Guided Differential Evolution algorithm, and the Levy Flight-Rotation SMA (LRSMA) algorithm, resulted in an average reduction in the minimum path length of (3.92%, 8.93%, 2.73%), along with corresponding reductions in path minimum values and processing times. Experiments show ESMA can find shortest collision-free paths for mobile robots in both static and dynamic environments.

AB It is very challenging to accurately segment smoke images because smoke has some adverse vision characteristics, such as anomalous shapes, blurred edges, and translucency. Existing methods cannot fully focus on the texture details of anomalous shapes and blurred edges simultaneously. To solve these problems, a Dense Multi-scale context and Asymmetric pooling Embedding Network (DMAENet) is proposed to model the smoke edge details and anomalous shapes for smoke segmentation. To capture the feature information from different scales, a Dense Multi-scale Context Module (DMCM) is proposed to further enhance the feature representation capability of our network under the help of asymmetric convolutions. To efficiently extract features for long-shaped objects, the authors use asymmetric pooling to propose an Asymmetric Pooling Enhancement Module (APEM). The vertical and horizontal pooling methods are responsible for enhancing features of irregular objects. Finally, a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) is designed, which accepts three inputs for improving performance. Low and high-level features are fused by pixel-wise summing, and then the summed feature maps are further enhanced in an attention manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real smoke datasets validate that all these modules can improve performance, and the proposed DMAENet obviously outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB The ability to create decentralized applications without the authority of a single entity has attracted numerous developers to build applications using blockchain technology. However, ensuring the correctness of such applications poses significant challenges, as it can result in financial losses or, even worse, a loss of user trust. Testing smart contracts introduces a unique set of challenges due to the additional restrictions and costs imposed by blockchain platforms during test case execution. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether testing techniques developed for traditional software can effectively be adapted to smart contracts. In this study, we propose a multi-objective test selection technique for smart contracts that aims to balance three objectives: time, coverage, and gas usage. We evaluated our approach using a comprehensive selection of real-world smart contracts and compared the results with various test selection methods employed in traditional software systems. Statistical analysis of our experiments, which utilized benchmark Solidity smart contract case studies, demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces the testing cost while still maintaining acceptable fault detection capabilities. This is in comparison to random search, mono-objective search, and the traditional re-testing method that does not employ heuristic search.

AB Laparoscopic education and surgery assessments increase the success rates and lower the risks during actual surgeries. Hospital residents need a secure setting, and trainees require a safe and controlled environment with cost-effective resources where they may hone their laparoscopic abilities. Thus, we have modeled and developed a surgical simulator to provide the initial training in Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy (LPN-a procedure to treat kidney cancer or renal masses). To achieve this, we created a virtual simulator using an open-source game engine that can be used with a commercially available, reasonably priced virtual reality (VR) device providing visual and haptic feedback. In this study, the proposed simulator's design is presented, costs are contrasted, and the simulator's performance is assessed using face and content validity measures. CPU-and GPU-based computers can run the novel simulation with a soft body deformation based on simplex meshes. With a reasonable trade-off between price and performance, the HTC Vive's controlled soft body effect, physics-based deformation, and haptic rendering offer the advantages of an excellent surgical simulator. The trials show that the medical volunteers who performed the initial LPN procedures for newbie surgeons received positive feedback.

AB In mobile edge computing (MEC), offloading computing tasks from edge clients to edge nodes can reduce the burden on edge clients, especially for delay-sensitive tasks, they must be completed within the deadline. However, when the edge nodes receive a large number of tasks, the waiting time of the tasks may be too long, and some tasks may even be dropped due to timeout. To address these problems, we model task offloading as a long-term optimization problem based on Markov decision process (MDP), we consider task queuing models on edge clients and edge nodes to optimize distributed task offloading schemes, and the current workload of edge nodes prediction model for dynamic task scheduling to avoid excessive workload of edge nodes. A distributed dynamic task offloading algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed, and a recurrent neural network controlled by Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Dueling-DQN and Double-DQN (DDQN) techniques enable each client to make its own offloading decisions without knowing other information. In order to improve the training efficiency and the stability of the strategy, a queue selection algorithm is proposed to reduce the action space. Experimental results show that, compared with some existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the workload of edge nodes and make reasonable offloading decisions, significantly reducing the average energy consumption and delay of edge clients, as well as the ratio of dropped tasks.

AB Image inpainting networks based on deep learning techniques have been widely used in many important fields. However, most inpainting networks fail to generate desirable repaired images. This may be due to their failure to extract effective features and accurately assign high weights to the undamaged regions. To alleviate these problems, an image inpainting network based on gated convolution and multi-level attention mechanism (IIN-GCMAM) is proposed in this paper. This network follows encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of the gated convolution encoder (GC-encoder) and the multi-level attention mechanism decoder (MAM-decoder). The GC-encoder weighs the extracted features with gated convolutions, which reduces the interference caused by the damaged regions. The multi-level attention mechanism employed in the MAM-decoder uses multi-scale feature maps spatially and channel-wise to improve the consistency in global structure and the fineness of repaired results. Extensive experiments are conducted on the common datasets, Paris StreetView and CelebA. Experimental results indicate that the proposed IIN-GCMAM can achieve a good performance on the common evaluation metrics and visual effects. It can achieve 0.0408, 0.720, and 22.27 in MAE, SSIM, and PSNR at the mask ratio of 50%-60%, respectively.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DE learning (artificial intelligence); neural nets; watermarking
AB The network structure of digital watermarking algorithm based on deep learning is usually encoder-noise layer-decoder. Most of the existing encoders suffer from the problem of insufficient feature extraction, and the introduction of simulated differentiable joint photographic experts group (JPEG) compression in the noise layer cannot ensure the robustness under real JPEG. In this paper, a watermarking algorithm based on multi-scale auto-encoder is proposed, which can effectively extract the image feature information by combining with the channel attention mechanism. At the same time, some parameters of decoder and encoder are shared to reduce redundant feature embedding and improve extraction accuracy. This paper also proposes a robust training scheme against JPEG compression, which can guide the model to store the watermark in the low-frequency region needed for decoding. Experimental results show that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the proposed algorithm is above 48 and the decoding rate is above 99% under JPEG compression with quality factor Q = 50. Moreover, this scheme can effectively promote the combination of noise layer in training. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also robust to other common network noises.

ID RAIN; REMOVAL; MODEL
AB Reconstructing a rain-free image from its degraded counterpart requires transforms regarding information from diverse frequency levels. On the frequency domain perspective, despite current CNNs-based methods exhibit excellent abilities in capturing the high-frequency components of images, they often fail to adequately consider or overlook the low-frequency information. To address this challenge, we introduce a fast Fourier transform block (FFTB) which can effectively capture both long-term and short-term interactions, while integrating high- and low-frequency residual information. Our FFTB is a conceptually simple yet computationally efficient block, leading to remarkable performance gains. Based on FFTB, we further develop a multi-stage architecture termed recursive residual fourier network (RRFNet) to enhance the ability of capturing and modeling spatial and frequency domain visual cues. To fully maximize the performance of RRFNet, a novel global-local convert test strategy is employed to alleviate the training-testing inconsistency. Experimental results on the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our RRFNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods while enjoying faster inference speed.

ID VIOLENCE DETECTION
AB An automated detection of aggressive and violent behaviour in videos has immense potential. It enables efficient online content filtering by restricting access to extreme content and also, when integrated with security systems, helps to monitor violence in surveillance videos. In this work, a convolutional neural network is combined with the proposed Spatial and Channel wise Attention-based ConvLSTM encoder (SCan-ConvLSTM). The proposed architecture performs an efficient spatiotemporal fusion of the features extracted from the video sequences containing fight scenes. In order to focus selectively on regions of utmost importance, this blended attention mechanism adjusts the weights of outputs in different locations and across different channels. This recurrent attention mechanism enhances the sequential refinement of activation maps and boosts the model performance. Finally, the experimental results have been presented that show the proposed architecture achieves superior results on the benchmark datasets (RWF-2000, Violent-flow, Hockey-fights, and Movies).

ID RECOGNITION
AB Botanists use morphological features of leaves for aquatic and semi-aquatic plants identification. In deep learning, the convolution process is efficacious to label images. Existing studies showed that, in deep learning-based leaf identification, direct image pixel values are used. Leaf images have similar sizes and almost equal pixel values. So, the pixel-based leaf naming procedure makes uncertainty in the feature results. The direct evaluation of image pixels for leaf image identification is not an effective method, because it is leading to a forgetting problem in continuous learning. Using the pre-processed databases, researchers are achieving more than 99% accurate results using deep learning. However, the same model fails to reproduce the same result in databases. In this study, morphological features of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant leaves are converted into digital descriptors to avoid uncertainty in the feature results. In this digital descriptor-based deep learning method, morphological features of aquatic and semi-aquatic plant leaves are used. This is equivalent to Botanists' morphological features-based leaf identification technology. Morphological feature extraction and digital descriptor generation helped this model to achieve 95% accuracy. In this model, leaf morphological features are used for training, so this help to understand the leaf properties of other leaf databases.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB In intelligent transportation systems, parsing traffic signs and transmitting traffic information to humans is an urgent need. However, despite the success achieved in the detection and recognition of low-level circular or triangular traffic signs, parsing the more complex and informative rectangular traffic signs remains unexplored and challenging. Our work is devoted to the topic called "Traffic Sign Understanding (TSU)", which is aimed to parse various traffic signs and generate semantic descriptions for them. To achieve this goal, we propose an end-to-end framework that integrates component detection, content reasoning, and semantic description generation. The component detection module first detects initial components in the sign image. Then the content reasoning module acquires the detailed content of the sign, including final components, their relations, and layout category, which provide local and global information for the subsequent module. In the end, the semantic description generation module mines relational attributes and text semantic attributes from the preceding results, embeds them with the layout categories, and transforms them into semantic descriptions through a dynamic prediction transformer. The three modules are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner for optimizing the overall performance. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance not only in the final semantic description generation stage but also on multiple subtasks of the CASIA-Tencent CTSU Dataset. Abundant ablation experiments are provided to prove the effectiveness of this method.

AB Discriminating salient moving objects against complex, cluttered backgrounds, with occlusions and challenging environmental conditions like weather and illumination, is essential for stateful scene perception in autonomous systems. We propose a novel deep architecture, named DeepFTSG, for robust moving object detection that incorporates single and multi-stream multi-channel USE-Net trellis asymmetric encoders extending U-Net with squeeze and excitation (SE) blocks and a single shared decoder network for fusing multiple motion and appearance cues. DeepFTSG is a deep learning based approach that builds upon our previous hand-engineered flux tensor split Gaussian (FTSG) change detection video analysis algorithm which won the CDNet CVPR Change Detection Workshop challenge competition. DeepFTSG generalizes much better than top-performing motion detection deep networks, such as the scene-dependent ensemble-based FgSegNet_v2, while using an order of magnitude fewer weights. Short-term motion and longer-term change cues are estimated using general-purpose unsupervised methods-flux tensor and multi-modal background subtraction, respectively. DeepFTSG was evaluated using the CDnet-2014 change detection challenge dataset, the largest change detection video sequence benchmark with 12.3 billion labeled pixels, and had an overall F-measure of 97%. We also evaluated the cross-dataset generalization capability of DeepFTSG trained solely on CDnet-2014 short video segments and then evaluated on unseen SBI-2015, LASIESTA and LaSOT benchmark videos. On the unseen SBI-2015 dataset, DeepFTSG had an F-measure accuracy of 87%, more than 30% higher compared to the top-performing deep network FgSegNet_v2 and outperforms the recently proposed KimHa method by 17%. On the unseen LASIESTA, DeepFTSG had an F-measure of 88% and outperformed the best recent deep learning method BSUV-Net2.0 by 3%. On the unseen LaSOT with axis-aligned bounding box ground-truth, network segmentation masks were converted to bounding boxes for evaluation, DeepFTSG had an F-Measure of 55%, outperforming KimHa method by 14% and FgSegNet_v2 by almost 1.5%. When a customized single DeepFTSG model is trained in a scene-dependent manner for comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, then DeepFTSG performs significantly better, reaching an F-Measure of 97% on SBI-2015 (+ 10%) and 99% on LASIESTA (+ 11%).

TI MixStyle Neural Networks for Domain Generalization and Adaptation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
AB Neural networks do not generalize well to unseen data with domain shifts-a longstanding problem in machine learning and AI. To overcome the problem, we propose MixStyle, a simple plug-and-play, parameter-free module that can improve domain generalization performance without the need to collect more data or increase model capacity. The design of MixStyle is simple: it mixes the feature statistics of two random instances in a single forward pass during training. The idea is grounded by the finding from recent style transfer research that feature statistics capture image style information, which essentially defines visual domains. Therefore, mixing feature statistics can be seen as an efficient way to synthesize new domains in the feature space, thus achieving data augmentation. MixStyle is easy to implement with a few lines of code, does not require modification to training objectives, and can fit a variety of learning paradigms including supervised domain generalization, semi-supervised domain generalization, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Our experiments show that MixStyle can significantly boost out-of-distribution generalization performance across a wide range of tasks including image recognition, instance retrieval and reinforcement learning. The source code is released at https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/mixstyle-release.

TI NNTBFV: Simplifying and Verifying Neural Networks Using Testing-Based

AB Neural networks are extensively employed in safety-critical systems. However, these critical systems incorporating neural networks continue to pose risks due to the presence of adversarial examples. Although the security of neural networks can be enhanced by verification, verifying neural networks is an NP-hard problem, making the application of verification algorithms to large-scale neural networks a challenging task. For this reason, we propose NNTBFV, a framework that utilizes the principles of Testing-Based Formal Verification (TBFV) to simplify neural networks and verify the simplified networks. Unlike conventional neural network pruning techniques, this approach is based on specifications, with the goal of deriving approximate execution paths under given preconditions. To mitigate the potential issue of unverifiable conditions due to overly broad preconditions, we also propose a precondition partition method. Empirical evidence shows that as the range of preconditions narrows, the size of the execution paths also reduces accordingly. The execution path generated by NNTBFV is still a neural network, so it can be verified by verification tools. In response to the results from the verification tool, we provide a theoretical method for analysis.We evaluate the effectiveness of NNTBFV on the ACAS Xu model project, choosing Verification-based and Random-based neural network simplification algorithms as the baselines for NNTBFV. Experiment results show that NNTBFV can effectively approximate the baseline in terms of simplification capability, and it surpasses the efficiency of the random-based method.

TI Demystifying Practices, Challenges and Expected Features of Using GitHub
   Copilot
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING

DE GitHub Copilot; Stack Overflow; GitHub discussions; repository mining
AB With the advances in machine learning, there is a growing interest in AI-enabled tools for autocompleting source code. GitHub Copilot, also referred to as the "AI Pair Programmer", has been trained on billions of lines of open source GitHub code, and is one of such tools that has been increasingly used since its launch in June 2021. However, little effort has been devoted to understanding the practices, challenges, and expected features of using Copilot in programming for auto-completed source code from the point of view of practitioners. To this end, we conducted an empirical study by collecting and analyzing the data from Stack Overflow (SO) and GitHub Discussions. More specifically, we searched and manually collected 303 SO posts and 927 GitHub discussions related to the usage of Copilot. We identified the programming languages, Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), technologies used with Copilot, functions implemented, benefits, limitations, and challenges when using Copilot. The results show that when practitioners use Copilot: (1) The major programming languages used with Copilot are JavaScript and Python, (2) the main IDE used with Copilot is Visual Studio Code, (3) the most common used technology with Copilot is Node.js, (4) the leading function implemented by Copilot is data processing, (5) the main purpose of users using Copilot is to help generate code, (6) the significant benefit of using Copilot is useful code generation, (7) the main limitation encountered by practitioners when using Copilot is difficulty of integration, and (8) the most common expected feature is that Copilot can be integrated with more IDEs. Our results suggest that using Copilot is like a double-edged sword, which requires developers to carefully consider various aspects when deciding whether or not to use it. Our study provides empirically grounded foundations that could inform software developers and practitioners, as well as provide a basis for future investigations on the role of Copilot as an AI pair programmer in software development.

AB Optimization is necessary for solving and improving the solution of various complex problems. Every meta-heuristic algorithm can have a weak point, and multiple mechanisms and methods can be used to overcome these weaknesses. Some algorithms perform well in the discovery phase and some algorithms perform better in the exploitation phase. Hybridizing algorithms can be a good solution to achieve a powerful algorithm, and hybridizing algorithms and mechanisms greedily lead to an increase in computational complexity and execution time. This paper presents a new and intelligent approach by hybridizing meta-heuristic algorithms and using different mechanisms simultaneously without significantly increasing the time complexity. For this purpose, salp swarm optimization (SSO) and the African vulture optimization algorithm (AVOA) have been hybridized to improve the optimization process of the modified choice function and learning automata mechanisms. In addition, two other improving mechanisms, named opposition-based learning (OBL) and beta-hill climbing (BHC) technique, have been presented and integrated with the AVOA-SSA algorithm. Fifty-two standard benchmarks were used to test and evaluate the AVOA-SSA algorithm. Finally, an improved version of the extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier has been used with real stock market data for stock market prediction. The obtained results indicate the excellent and acceptable performance of the AVOA-SSA algorithm in `solving optimization problems and have been able to achieve high-quality solutions. According to the results obtained from the AVOA-SSA algorithm, in comparison to global optimization problems, the AVOA-SSA algorithm has been able to obtain the best results in 21 functions out of 23 standard benchmarks. Also, against CEC2017 problems, it has been able to perform best in 26 out of 29 functions. In addition, the AVOA-SSA algorithm has been able to perform better than other compared algorithms in all five datasets evaluated in the stock market.

AB Parameter estimation is one of key issues in the study of uncertain differential equations. In this paper, one novel estimation method named the estimating function technique of uncertain differential equations based on uncertain integrals is proposed, which is the first method based on uncertain integrals appeared in the literature. Compared to existing methods, our approach fully utilizes information from both the parameters and observed data. In certain settings, previous methods can be viewed as special cases of our technique. One numerical example with different transform functions is provided to illustrate our method and the efficiency is shown by residual analysis. Additionally, a case study on Alibaba stock prices is included to demonstrate the application of our method. The paper concludes with final remarks and recommendations for future research.

   Skeleton-based action recognition; CNN; GCN; Player pose estimation
AB Football (soccer) stands as the world's most popular sport, enthralling millions of fans globally. Within the dynamic sphere of modern football, gaining comprehensive insights into the nuanced technical and physical demands placed on players is pivotal for performance optimization. This paper introduces an innovative deep learning-powered image classification algorithm for recognizing football player activities directly from videos and images. Our pioneering approach harnesses the synergistic capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to decipher intricate spatial-temporal patterns in player poses and motions. The methodology employs a hybrid CNN and GCN architecture. The CNN leverages consecutive convolutional and pooling layers to automatically extract discriminative visual features from input frames capturing player poses. The GCN models' skeletal joints as graph nodes with bones as edges, performing graph convolutions to aggregate spatial and temporal information from neighboring body parts. This enables capturing localized pose dynamics. The complementary CNN and GCN outputs are fused through fully connected layers to classify player activities based on both visual appearances and pose configurations. The model is trained end to end on richly annotated football video data using a multi-class cross-entropy loss. Data augmentation and regularization techniques enhance robustness. Extensive experiments validate the proposed architecture's effectiveness, achieving 97.4% accuracy, 96% precision, 95.5% recall, 95.4% F1-score, 0.90 Matthews correlation, and 93% specificity in classifying 17 complex football activities significantly higher than previous benchmarks. Detailed ablation studies confirm the contributions of the CNN, GCN, and fused model components. The work represents a major advance in leveraging deep neural networks for accurate and granular analysis of sports performances.

AB Enhancing the financial ecosystem encourages financial reform, stability, and the achievement of all-encompassing and sustainable development. Financial risk assessment is essential, because it affects not only a company's development but also the general economic progress of society. The backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used in this study to create a proactive financial risk pre-alarm system by recognizing the critical role that risk assessment plays in promoting financial reform, stability, and sustainable development within the financial ecosystem. In this paper, we utilized the capabilities of the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) as a way of creating a proactive financial risk pre-alarm system by realizing the crucial significance of risk assessment in supporting financial reform, stability, and sustainable development within the financial ecosystem. First, data on assessing financial risk is collected, including earnings reports, economic indicators, political developments that have an impact on the economy, and some previous financial data. After the data have been acquired, it is preprocessed by being cleaned, having extra attributes removed, missing values removed, and normalized. An initial set of random parameters is used to create a BPNN architecture, which is then trained using a fraction of the collected data. Next, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize the parameters of BPNN, including learning rate, neuronal count, hidden layer count, etc. The remaining data from the collection is then used to test the optimized BPNN, and its performance is assessed. The result of the developed model is carefully assessed and compared with other methodologies and with previously published works, showing that this method's accuracy is unquestionably superior to that of the other financial risk analysis algorithms. The mistake is reduced by 45.69%, and our model's accuracy is 97.94%, which is 21.32% greater than the accuracy of the comparison algorithm.

AB In a large number of multivalued logic and fuzzy logic of algebraic systems, residuated lattices play a prominent role and have considerable applications. States operators have been introduced on residuated lattices, and their properties are useful for the development of an algebraic theory of probabilistic models of those algebras. In this paper, we introduce the notion of state ideal in the framework of state residuated lattices, investigate some related properties, and provide several examples. Also, we present two types of state residuated lattices: state i-simple residuated lattices and state i-local residuated lattices, and characterize them. Moreover, the relationship between state ideals and state filters is analyzed using the set of complement elements. Furthermore, we prove that the lattice of all state ideals of a given state residuated lattice is a complete lattice. The notion of obstinate state ideals in state residuated lattices is also introduced, and several characterizations are presented.

AB Because of the advent of new technologies like machine learning (ML), the Internet of Things (IoT), and big data, nearly every electronic device in the modern era of digitization is now capable of making intelligent decisions. To transform instructional management in the big data and educational informatization era, institutions are using digital technologies. Though there has been significant progress in this area, there are still numerous issues with the informatization of instructional management in universities, which have an impact on both the quality of construction and the effectiveness of the application. To improve effectiveness, efficiency, and data security, we investigated in this study how to integrate IoT devices and big data analytics methods into university instructional management systems. Universities can handle security and data integrity concerns while extracting insights from complex data streams by utilizing IoT devices with big data analytics. To achieve the stated goal, we first carefully examined the current university instructional management system to identify its shortcomings. After that, we presented our proposal for an instructional management system for universities that collects data using IoT devices, and it undergoes preprocessing to get it ready for big data analytics. Some of the data mining and big data analytics algorithms such as K-mean clustering, PCA, and Apriori algorithms were applied to get a thorough insight from the collected data. Students were grouped according to their academic activities using the K-mean clustering algorithm. By lowering the dimensionality, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is utilized to determine the relationship between a student's library visit and their final grade. The result of our proposed system is carefully analyzed to display the various levels of student interaction, their study habits, and their final grade.

AB The environmental perception system is the foundation of unmanned driving systems and also the fundamental guarantee of the safety and intelligence of unmanned vehicles. The obstacle hazard identification technology is the core of the environment perception system, and it is also the basic condition for the autonomous driving of unmanned vehicles. In view of the complexity of obstacle danger identification, this research paper designs an improved Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes through a systematic approach. First, it highlights the significance of morphological component analysis in identifying non-smooth regions within images where obstacles are likely to be present. Second, it introduces a novel approach for core point definition by identifying an optimal MinDensity value based on the curvature of the density distribution curve. Third, it addresses variations in density sequences through smoothing and normalization. Finally, it constructs an improved DBSCAN Algorithm for hazard recognition of obstacles in unmanned scenes. It addresses limitations in the traditional DBSCAN by refining the core point definition using an adaptive density threshold. It identifies the "elbow point" in density distribution, enhancing its ability to distinguish density states. Additionally, it incorporates density curve smoothing, normalization, and a merger step for handling stationary objects. The results show that it has high accuracy (95.6%), precision (96.3%), recall (94.5%), and F-Score (95.4%), as well as increased consistency (92.5%) and dependability (93.2%). It also has fast real-time data processing, lasting only 0.12 s, making it an excellent choice for obstacle detection and unmanned hazard avoidance.

AB In recent years, the automotive industry has witnessed the increasing adoption of mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) to meet the demands of mass customization. However, the diverse components of various end products are posing significant challenges to the material feeding processes in MMALs. To address this issue and enhance the material feeding efficiency, this paper proposes an innovative automatic monorail shuttle system (AMSS). The AMSS is designed based on the layout of line-integrated supermarkets and incorporates the load-exchangeable shuttles and crossovers. Considering the importance of cost control in manufacturing enterprises, the objective of this paper is to minimize the total costs associated with the material feeding system, which includes the installation costs of crossovers, as well as the input and operation costs of load-exchangeable shuttles. A mathematical model is thereby established to describe the problem, and its accuracy is validated through the Gurobi solver. Recognizing the NP-hard nature of the proposed problem, a shuffled frog leaping-based hyper-heuristic (SBHH) algorithm is developed to allocate and schedule the shuttles and crossovers, which adopts the shuffled frog leaping algorithm as the high-level heuristic for selecting low-level heuristics. To further improve the performance, dynamic decision unit is introduced to raise the solution accuracy and the convergence speed. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed SBHH algorithm both in solution quality and convergence speed by comparing with other benchmark optimization algorithms. Managerial applications indicate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach, offering implications for practitioners in the automotive industry.

AB In recent years, research on sustainable consumption has been particularly relevant, highlighting the importance of the collective over the individual to reduce pollution. This study focuses on the study of the perceived marketplace influence (PMI) concept in its organizational and consumer dimensions, together with the financial incentives that exist in the adoption of electric cars and their effect on green customer engagement. A sample of 382 potential buyers of electric vehicles was obtained. A new hybrid analytical approach was taken structural equation modelling and artificial neural network. The research found the most significant variables affecting purchase intention were financial incentives, followed by PMI Organization and finally PMI Consumer. The results of artificial neural network analysis confirmed all the findings of the structural equation modelling, although the importance of each PMI dimension is different for each technique used. The conclusions point to new business opportunities that can be exploited by companies selling this green technology.

AB Nanofluids are thermoelectric substance with a greater thermal transmission effectiveness than traditional thermal fluids. Nanofluid's specific heat capacity (SHC) is a crucial thermophysical parameter since it controls the fluid's heat transfer coefficient. Surprisingly few research investigations have been done on the prognostic modelling of the specific heat capacity of fusion nanofluids, despite the fact that numerous experiments have been conducted on the heat transfer capacitance of blended nanofluids. This study focuses on the use of algorithms based on machine learning procedures (MLP) to estimate the SHC of blended nanofluids. Numerous numbers of hybrid nanofluids are investigated in this investigation. Total of 984 samples of hybrid nanofluids for specific heat capacity has been collected from nine experimental research papers. Various MLP techniques were utilized in this analysis, including extreme boost gradient boost regression (XGB), support vector regression augmented with a genetic algorithm (support vector regression [SVR]-genetic algorithm [GA]), grid search optimized based gradient boost regression algorithm (GBR) (GBR-GSO), and voting ensemble procedure (VE). The obtained correlation coefficients of the SVR-GA, XGB, VE and GBR-GSO models for the testing dataset are 98.43%, 96.29%, 94.4% and 96.55% respectively. The SVR-GA model showed a better predictive accuracy relative to other ML models. This SVR-GA anticipated model could be used for quick and reliable prediction of the SHC of blended nanofluids which reduces the burden associated with experimental measurement possible future work includes applying a machine-learning strategy to the problem of determining the diffusivity of hybrid nanofluids.

AB Computerized tomography (CT) is a clinically primary technique to differentiate benign-malignant pulmonary nodules for lung cancer diagnosis. Early classification of pulmonary nodules is essential to slow down the degenerative process and reduce mortality. The interactive paradigm assisted by neural networks is considered to be an effective means for early lung cancer screening in large populations. However, some inherent characteristics of pulmonary nodules in high-resolution CT images, e.g., diverse shapes and sparse distribution over the lung fields, have been inducing inaccurate results. On the other hand, most existing methods with neural networks are dissatisfactory from a lack of transparency. In order to overcome these obstacles, a united framework is proposed, including the classification and feature visualization stages, to learn distinctive features and provide visual results. Specifically, a bilateral scheme is employed to synchronously extract and aggregate global-local features in the classification stage, where the global branch is constructed to perceive deep-level features and the local branch is built to focus on the refined details. Furthermore, an encoder is built to generate some features, and a decoder is constructed to simulate decision behavior, followed by the information bottleneck viewpoint to optimize the objective. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate our framework on two publicly available datasets, namely, 1) the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) and 2) the Lung and Colon Histopathological Image Dataset (LC25000). For instance, our framework achieves 92.98% accuracy and presents additional visualizations on the LIDC. The experiment results show that our framework can obtain outstanding performance and is effective to facilitate explainability. It also demonstrates that this united framework is a serviceable tool and further has the scalability to be introduced into clinical research.

AB We introduce a hedonic game form, Hedonic Expertise Games (HEGs), that naturally models a variety of settings where agents with complementary qualities would like to form groups. Students forming groups for class projects, and hackathons in which software developers, graphic designers, project managers, and other domain experts collaborate on software projects, are typical scenarios modeled by HEGs. This game form possesses the common ranking property, and additionally, the coalitional utility function is monotone. We present comprehensive results for the existence/nonexistence of stable and efficient partitions of HEGs with respect to the most common stability and optimality concepts used in the literature. Specifically, we show that an HEG instance may not have a strict core stable partition, and yet every HEG instance has a strong Nash stable and Pareto optimal partition. Furthermore, it may be the case that none of the socially-optimal partitions of an HEG instance is Nash stable or core stable. However, it is guaranteed that every socially-optimal partition is contractually Nash stable. We show that all these existence/nonexistence results also hold for the monotone hedonic games with common ranking property (monotone HGCRP). We also present several results for HEGs from the computational complexity perspective, some of which are as follows: A contractually Nash stable partition (and a Nash stable partition in a restricted setting) can be found in polynomial time. A strong Nash stable partition can be approximated within a factor of 1- 1/e, and this bound is tight even for approximating core stable partitions. We present a natural game dynamics for monotone HGCRP that converges to a Nash stable partition in a relatively low number of moves.

DE Extended reality; Gaze tracking; User attention; Spatial gaze
AB With the rise of Metaverse, Extended Reality (XR) and its enabling techniques have received increasing attention. Spatial gaze tracking is one of these techniques that enables capturing a user's visual attention, so as to support immersive 3D experience and interaction. Due to the limitations in the employed visual models and algorithms, the existing proposals of gaze tracking can only provide planar gaze tracking or approximate spatial gaze tracking. A critical problem behind is that so far there isn't an accurate and efficient approach for XR devices to sense the spatial gaze, that are modeled based on the vergence of the binocular visual axes. To address this problem, this paper proposes SpatialGaze, a spatial gaze tracking approach based on the realistic parallax-contingent visual model. SpatialGaze contains a tailored design for XR devices, which is accurate, lightweight, and practical for use. Our implementation and evaluation demonstrate that SpatialGaze achieves an average error of 0.52 degrees in direction tracking and an average error of 75.52 cm in depth perception. Compared to the baseline approach, SpatialGaze reduces the direction and depth errors by up to 52.62 and 75.15%, respectively.

ID STABILIZATION
AB In recent years, high-order fully actuated (HOFA) systems, founded by Prof. GR Duan, have recorded rapid progress for deterministic systems. However, the control issue of stochastic fully actuated systems is still an open problem. This study develops a novel stochastic HOFA system model that complements the existing HOFA methodology. Notably, stochastic signals can be considered in the proposed model, different from the case in the deterministic model. By adopting a high-order operator, equivalent control and stabilization control laws are realized to guarantee the global asymptotic stability in probability of the closed-loop system. For the system with sensor gain faults, an observer-based fault-tolerant control law is designed. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

ML models are developed employing input features associated with pile geometry and CPT resistances along with the ultimate bearing capacity being the only output feature. Following the training/testing sequences, the interpretability of ML predictions is examined through the Shapley and Joint Shapley value methods. Shapley values for multiple feature combinations allow ML models to decide the number of features necessary to make the most accurate predictions. Using updated input features, the models are rebuilt and predictions are repeated with the new input feature set; hence, the re-evaluation of ML models is focused on at this point. These features are twofold: One has two geometric features attributed to piles: cross-section area and length, and the other is a single feature attributed to soil, the average CPT tip resistance, which are overall sufficient in predicting the load capacity of both closed and open-ended piles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the pioneers of its kind for pile foundations. The results show that the predictions of ML methods aided with strong interpretability techniques prove to be necessary in providing accurate results. As a result, Shapley is determined to be a useful tool for other geotechnical engineering applications as well.

AB Satellite images, widely used in recent years and entered the field of remote sensing technology, continuously record image data in databases worldwide. These image data, which are continually obtained, changing, and have a large volume, fall into the big data category. On the other hand, CNN-based techniques, a sub-branch of artificial intelligence, have been widely used to classify and segment image data in recent years. The scope of this study, firstly, it was tried to determine spatial positions and building objects from large-volume satellite images with classical CNN methods. However, classical CNN models could not process the data even in ECW format, one of the most compressed satellite imagery forms. To overcome these problems, a new approach called DSHFS has been proposed. It uses hybrid CNN, GeoServer, and TileCache techniques related to different disciplines to detect structures from large-volume satellite images and their spatial locations. In the proposed DSHFS approach, large-volume satellite imagery is first published in WMS format with GeoServer, which has an open-source strategy. Then, the data are converted into small images containing coordinate information with the TileCache system in size 256 x 256. Finally, the building objects in these images are detected by CNN models. In the proposed DSHFS approach, the actual locations of the detected structures on the earth are calculated using the location information of the image presented as input to the CNN model. In order to examine the performance of the proposed DSHFS approach, satellite imagery covering 12.5 GB in the computer system in ECW format, which corresponds to an area of approximately 17.200 km(2) of Kayseri province, was used. In the proposed DSHFS approach, Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, and YOLO models are used as the CNN model. When the proposed DSHFS approach is examined according to the F1 score, DSHFS Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, and YOLO obtain F1 scores of 0.961, 0.964, and 0.910, respectively. When evaluating the computational efficiency of the proposed approaches, it was found that DSHFS Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, and YOLO took 512.72, 188.20, and 99.35 s, respectively, to identify the structures and their locations in the image. DSHFS YOLO approach detected approximately 2 times faster than MobileNet and approximately 5 times faster than Faster R-CNN. When the proposed DSHFS approach is generally examined, it detects the building objects from the satellite image and their actual positions on the earth in approximately 0.13 s.

AB In computer vision, transformers have shown increasing effectiveness for high-level vision tasks. To further cope with low-level vision tasks, we propose a general framework, namely local reasoning back-projection transformer (LRB-T) for removing multiple types of bad weather (rain, haze, rain fog, raindrop, et al.) affecting images. Specifically, this paper first integrates the back-projection mechanism into the transformer architecture, where iterative up- and down-projection modules effectively feed and correct the feature reconstruction errors for spatial information preservation, and reduce computational costs since nearly half of the feature maps participate in the back-projection using half resolution. Besides, the proposed adaptive local reasoning block captures important neighborhood information through multiple local reasoning schemes. It can aggregate adjacent tokens to produce spatial-specific involution kernels, attention weights and dynamic positional encodings for local structure updating, and provide implicit spatial feature transform to achieve spatial-wise feature modulation. A pyramid scale guidance module is also established to enable arbitrary size generation consistent with the input, and generate scale-dependent trainable parameters to enhance skip connections. Extensive experiments on four types of well-known bad weather datasets show that the proposed LRB-T improves the image deraining, dehazing, de-rain fog and de-raindrop performance in terms of PSNR and SSIM effectively and outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific bad weather removal methods.

AB IntroductionIn today's dynamic logistics landscape, the role of intelligent robots is paramount for enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring safety. Traditional path planning methods often struggle to adapt to changing environments, resulting in issues like collisions and conflicts. This research addresses the challenge of path planning and control for logistics robots operating in complex environments. The proposed method aims to integrate information from various perception sources to enhance path planning and obstacle avoidance, thereby increasing the autonomy and reliability of logistics robots.MethodsThe method presented in this paper begins by employing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn feature representations of objects within the environment, enabling object recognition. Subsequently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are utilized to capture spatio-temporal features and predict the behavior and trajectories of dynamic obstacles. This predictive capability empowers robots to more accurately anticipate the future positions of obstacles in intricate settings, thereby mitigating potential collision risks. Finally, the Dijkstra algorithm is employed for path planning and control decisions to ensure the selection of optimal paths across diverse scenarios.ResultsIn a series of rigorous experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of both path planning accuracy and obstacle avoidance performance. These substantial improvements underscore the efficacy of the intelligent path planning and control scheme.DiscussionThis research contributes to enhancing the practicality of logistics robots in complex environments, thereby fostering increased efficiency and safety within the logistics industry. By combining object recognition, spatio-temporal modeling, and optimized path planning, the proposed method enables logistics robots to navigate intricate scenarios with higher precision and reliability, ultimately advancing the capabilities of autonomous logistics operations.

AB This article lucubrates the bifurcations in respect of a fractional-order neutral-type neural network(FONTNN) with two nonidentical delays. To begin with, the characteristic equation of the linearized FONTNN is deliberated and the nonidentical delays-induced bifurcation conditions are attained. It elucidates that the devised FONTNN is capable of maintaining stability performance when choosing a lesser time delay. Afterwards, FONTNN illustrates exceptional stability performance by detailed comparisons with regard to integer-order neutral-type delayed NNs. The effects of the coefficients for self-inhibition or time delay on the bifurcation points are carefully undertaken. It manifests that the coefficients for self-inhibition or time delay can postpone(advance) the onset of bifurcation of the developed FONTNN. Furthermore, fractional-order retarded delayed neural network(FORDNN) exhibits better performance in comparison with FONTNN. Conversely, it hints that the acquired stability results are fabulously inaccurate once neglecting the reverberations of neutral delays for FONNs. The correctness of the developed results is lastly indicated via numerical experiments.

AB Time series classification (TSC) aims to predict the class label of a given time series, which is critical to a rich set of application areas such as economics and medicine. State-of-the-art TSC methods have mostly focused on classification accuracy, without considering classification speed. However, efficiency is important for big data analysis. Datasets with a large training size or long series challenge the use of the current highly accurate methods, because they are usually computationally expensive. Similarly, classification explainability, which is an important property required by modern big data applications such as appliance modeling and legislation such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, has received little attention. To address these gaps, we propose a novel TSC method - the Randomized-Supervised Time Series Forest (r-STSF). r-STSF is extremely fast and achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy. It is an efficient interval-based approach that classifies time series according to aggregate values of the discriminatory sub-series (intervals). To achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, r-STSF builds an ensemble of randomized trees using the discriminatory sub-series. It uses four time series representations, nine aggregation functions and a supervised binary-inspired search combined with a feature ranking metric to identify highly discriminatory sub-series. The discriminatory sub-series enable explainable classifications. Experiments on extensive datasets show that r-STSF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while being orders of magnitude faster than most existing TSC methods and enabling for explanations on the classifier decision.

ID PROTEIN FUNCTION PREDICTION
AB Information-theoretic measures have been commonly applied to evaluate the relevance and redundancy in multi-label feature selection. However, the current multi-label feature selection methods based on information-theoretic measures neglect the dynamic changes in the relevance of selected features and candidate features. Furthermore, they also do not fully consider the influence of label redundancy on the relevance of candidate features. In this paper, we first propose a new feature relevance term named Dynamic Correlation Change (DCC), which uses two conditional mutual information terms to evaluate the dynamic changes in the relevance of selected features and candidate features. We then introduce a new label redundancy term named Label Redundancy with Interaction Information (LRII), which more accurately quantifies the influence of label redundancy on the relevance of candidate features. On this basis, we design a new multi-label feature selection method, called Maximum Dynamic Correlation Change and Minimum Label Redundancy (MDCCMLR), by combining DCC and LRII. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments in order to verify the performance of our method by comparing it with some state-of-the-art multi-label feature selection methods based on information-theoretic measures in terms of six evaluation metrics. The experimental results show that the MDCCMLR method outperforms the other comparison methods on all six evaluation metrics.

AB Clustering is a grouping technique that has long been used to relate data homogeneously. With the huge growth of complex datasets from different sources in the last decade, new paradigms have emerged. Multiclustering is a new concept within clustering that attempts to simultaneously generate multiple clusters that are bound to be different from each other, allowing to analyze and discover hidden patterns in the dataset compared to single clustering methods. This paper presents a hybrid methodology based on an evolutionary approach with the concepts of hyperrectangle for multiclustering, called MultiCHCClust. The algorithm is applied in a post-processing stage and it improves the results obtained for a clustering algorithm with respect to the partitioning of the dataset and the optimization of the number of partitions, achieving a high degree of compactness and separation of the partitioned dataset as can be observed in a complete experimental study.

AB In this study, unidentified flying machines are built with real-time monitoring in mid-course settings for obstacle avoidance in mind. The majority of the currently available methods are implemented as comprehensive monitoring systems, with significant success in monitored applications like bridges, railways, etc. So, the predicted model is developed exclusively for specific monitoring settings, as opposed to the broad conditions that are used by the current approaches. Also, in the design model, the first steps are taken by limiting the procedure to specific heights, and the input thrust that is provided for take up operation is kept to a minimum. Due to the improved altitudes, the velocity and acceleration units have been cranked up on purpose, making it possible to sidestep intact objects. In addition, Advanced Image Mapping Localization (AIML) is used to carry out the implementation process, which identifies stable sites at the correct rotation angle. Besides, Cyphal protocol integration improves the security of the data-gathering process by transmitting information gathered from sensing devices. The suggested system is put to the test across five different case studies, where the designed Unmanned aerial vehicle can able to detect 25 obstacles in the narrow paths in considered routs but existing approach can able to identify only 14 obstacle in the same routes.

AB Finding associations between genetic markers and a phenotypic trait such as coronary artery disease (CAD) is of primary interest in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). A major challenge in GWAS is the involved genomic data often contain large number of genetic markers and the underlying genotype-phenotype relationship is mostly complex. Current statistical and machine learning methods lack the power to tackle this challenge with effectiveness and efficiency. In this paper, we develop a stochastic search method to mine the genotype-phenotype associations from GWAS data. The new method generalizes the well-established association rule mining (ARM) framework for searching for the most important genotype-phenotype association rules, where we develop a multinomial Gibbs sampling algorithm and use it together with the Apriori algorithm to overcome the overwhelming computing complexity in ARM in GWAS. Three simulation studies based on synthetic data are used to assess the performance of our developed method, delivering the anticipated results. Finally, we illustrate the use of the developed method through a case study of CAD GWAS.

AB Dealing with security requirements in fixed budgets and strict time limits is becoming increasingly complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive. In addition, the system becomes more complicated when protecting the replicated distributed real-time database system (RDRTDBS) under many security guidelines. Vital structures, military, government, and financial institutions face immense pressure to secure their databases from unauthorized access. Such specifications mandate a rigorous security scan of each device before they are deemed appropriate for use. In the current paper, we demonstrate that performance and security requirements can be achieved simultaneously. We introduce PASS, a performance-aware security-satisfied replication protocol for data replica sites. Our proposed solution (i.e., PASS) is heuristic rather than optimal. Our main concept is to minimize the number of encryption operations for the least important or rarely accessed data items. PASS reduces the number of encryption operations by categorizing data items into three categories: (i) most secure, (ii) medium secure, and (iii) least secure. The most secure and medium secure data items are protected by the key generated from our proposed algorithm and the existing algorithm, respectively. In contrast, the Least Secure data items are kept unencrypted, and no encryption operation is performed to secure such data items. Effectively minimizing encryption operations implies a reduction in computation and power consumption at data replica sites. Unlike traditional encrypted RDRTDBS that stores data encryption keys on disks and encrypts all data items, we present a hybrid key generation method that encrypts only the important data items. Based on the experimental results, we conclude that PASS reduces the number of encryption operations and provides high-level protection in RDRTDBS.

AB A tool that could suggest new personalized research directions and ideas by taking insights from the scientific literature could profoundly accelerate the progress of science. A field that might benefit from such an approach is artificial intelligence (AI) research, where the number of scientific publications has been growing exponentially over recent years, making it challenging for human researchers to keep track of the progress. Here we use AI techniques to predict the future research directions of AI itself. We introduce a graph-based benchmark based on real-world data-the Science4Cast benchmark, which aims to predict the future state of an evolving semantic network of AI. For that, we use more than 143,000 research papers and build up a knowledge network with more than 64,000 concept nodes. We then present ten diverse methods to tackle this task, ranging from pure statistical to pure learning methods. Surprisingly, the most powerful methods use a carefully curated set of network features, rather than an end-to-end AI approach. These results indicate a great potential that can be unleashed for purely ML approaches without human knowledge. Ultimately, better predictions of new future research directions will be a crucial component of more advanced research suggestion tools.

AB In multiple attribute decision making (MADM), there is often a need for comparing the attributes. In situations such as time pressure and lack of adequate knowledge, eliciting exact numerical weights from decision maker (DM) is impossible, but instead, obtaining a ranking of the attributes using an elicitation method is practical. Hence, many investigators have concentrated on a branch of the methods called approximate weighting. These methods generate the surrogate weights for the precise numbers that cannot be extracted from the DM's mind. Many researchers have attempted to get the best approximate weights as close as possible to precise weights. There are several approximate weighting methods; among others, it is well known that the rank order centroid (ROC) outperforms the others. In competition with the ROC method, this paper develops a novel method, called rank order logarithm (ROL), that is based on a justifiable and well-founded concept. Three evaluations are performed to compare the ROC and ROL methods: a set of simulation experiments, a theoretical analysis, and a real-case analysis. Interestingly, the results of all the three evaluations reveal that the ROL method is comparable to the ROC method in most situations. To show applicability of the ROL method in real-world situations, a study case taken from high-technology selection in petroleum industry is examined.

AB Infrared small and dim target has posed great challenges on the target detection and tracking, especially for early warning, navigation and guidance. However, most common tracking algorithms are inefficient for infrared small target due to huge computation, and complicated feature analysis on such target is useless and needless. As such, a fast and useful algorithm based on the kernel correlation filter (KCF) is proposed in this paper. It supplies a solution for target without clear characteristic, target missing and analog interference in complex backgrounds. The proposed algorithm focuses on model update and scale update rules, fusion feature expression and multi-cues constrained re-detection module; all of the ideas aim to optimize process and improve practicability. Firstly, the improved ridge regression model with solving boundary effect and model consistency can get more precise results. Secondly, a useful strengthened feature description (SFD) including the fused feature extraction and complete confidence indicator is proposed to improve the reliability of tracking. Thirdly, the stabilized re-detection (SR) strategy is designed based on motion rules, which can cope with abnormal disturbance and missing states. Fourthly, an adaptive model update is proposed, which can reduce the error accumulation. The experiment results and the comparative studies with some common algorithms show that the proposed algorithm achieves the success rate of tracking above 98%, RMSE of center location below 5 pixels and speed above 120 fps and tends to be more effective.

AB It is found that, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalence worldwide. Quality of life (QoL) in terms of health became an essential measure for patients with CKD. This paper uses the real-time dataset of CKD patients collected from reputed medical dialysis unit in Chennai, India. We measure the inter and intra class variations between the clinical and non-clinical attributes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied on twelve clinical (biomarkers) and eight non-clinical (comorbiditity) attributes to find salient among them. ANOVA is applied only on reduced attributes to calculate the correlation between the target variables such as mortality, age and gender. The characteristics of the attributes and its discriminating nature is evaluated using various well known classifiers such as Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, Neive Bayes, decision tree, random forest and artificial neural network. The performance of the classifiers are evaluated using parameters such as confusion matrix, accuracy, F-measure, precision and recall. It is found that, the covariance of the attributes linearly separates the output space of target variables that are considered and the performance is encouraged.

AB Sustainable agriculture is becoming increasingly important in the face of growing environmental challenges. One key aspect of sustainable agriculture is managing soil resources effectively. In this context, digital soil mapping (DSM) has emerged as a powerful tool to understand soil variability better and inform land management decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive data warehouse for DSM that supports climate change analysis. Our architecture integrates frequent itemset mining (FMI) and association rules mining (ARM) to extract insights from large-scale soil data. We review related studies in soil data warehousing and ARM, identify gaps, and propose a data warehouse architecture leveraging the galaxy multidimensional model for DSM based on the SCORPAN model, which incorporates all relevant soil forming factors. We employ and compare A-priori, FP-growth, and ECLAT algorithms to efficiently mine frequent itemsets and generate association rules. Our intensive experiments evaluation demonstrates that FP-growth outperforms the other algorithms in accuracy, scalability, and speed and requires less memory. Additionally, we utilized correlation metrics for ARM, such as lift, cosine, kulc, and Imbalance ratio, to obtain the most significant and relevant association rules. These rules provide valuable insights into the complex relationships between soil properties and environmental factors, which can inform land management decisions and improve sustainable agriculture practices. This work contributes to the growing body of research on DSM and data-driven approaches to sustainable agriculture.

AB The hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR) without auxiliary high-resolution images is a challenging task in computer vision applications. The existing methods almost resort to the deep convolutional neural networks of fixed geometrical kernel, which can not model the long-range dependencies and does not conform to the human visual cognition. To address this issue, we propose the cognitively-inspired multi-scale spectral-spatial transformer for HSI SR. To solve the problem of high storage and computation burden, the overlapped band grouping strategy is adopted in light of high similarity between neighboring spectral bands of HSI. Considering the different textures and details that appear in HSIs, inspired by the human cognitive mechanism, the multi-scale spatial and spectral transformer blocks are developed which can efficiently and effectively learn the spatial and spectral feature representation at different scales and long-range dependencies of features. Finally, to fuse the feature information of neighboring groups, the 2D convolution mixed with 3D separable convolution is designed, which fully explores the complementarity and continuity of spatial and spectral information. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method yields state-of-the-art results at different scales. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through spatial and spectral dimension data visualization and ablation experiments. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/liushiji666/MMSSTN. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of our proposed method, which largely overcomes the disadvantage that convolution is ineffective for long-range dependence modeling. The method performs long-range dependence modeling on both spatial and spectral features and efficiently mines complementary information between bands, thereby enhancing the model's high perceptual ability.

AB Network embedding has been extensively used in several practical applications and achieved great success. However, existing studies mainly focus on single task or single view and cannot obtain deeper relevant information for accomplishing tasks. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to address the problem of insufficient information consideration in network embedding, which is termed multi-task-oriented adaptive dual-channel graph convolutional network (TAD-GCN). We firstly use kNN graph construction method to generate three views for each network dataset. Then, the proposed TAD-GCN contains dual-channel GCN which can extract the specific and shared embeddings from multiple views simultaneously, and attention mechanism is adopted to fuse them adaptively. In addition, we design similarity constraint and difference constraint to further enhance their semantic similarity and ensure that they capture the different information. Lastly, a multi-task learning module is introduced to solve multiple tasks simultaneously and optimize the model with its losses. The experimental results demonstrate that our model TAD-GCN not only completes multiple downstream tasks at the same time, but also achieves excellent performance compared with eight state-of-the-art methods.

AB Methods for short-term voltage stability (STVS) assessment based on phasor measurement unit (PMU) data have become quite abundant. However, most of them are challenged to deal with the commonly encountered incomplete PMU data. Existing models for STVS assessment of incomplete PMU data mostly have the disadvantages of high computational complexity and large impact from the level of data missing. This paper proposes a multi-task learning method that performs stability assessment and missing data completion in parallel. The Transformer Encoder is used as the shared feature extractor, a GRU structure is used to output complete PMU data sequences, and a BP neural network is used to output stability assessment results. The loss function used for the missing completion task considers the accuracy in both the shape and time domains. A comparison with relevant models shows that the model proposed in this paper achieves the best performance in all indicators and is minimally affected by the observation windows and the level of data loss, demonstrating good robustness.

AB Images are often affected by insufficient illumination and suffer from degradation problems such as low brightness, noise, and color distortion, which results in reduced image quality. Existing low-light image enhancement methods based on Retinex theory decompose images into reflectance and illumination components, which are adjusted separately; however, the intrinsic connection between reflectance and illumination during decomposition is not considered, and multi-scale information during subsequent adjustments is inadequately utilized. In this study, we propose a low-light image enhancement network based on Retinex decomposition and multi-scale adjustment (RDMA), which performs initial decomposition followed by subsequent adjustment. We utilized prior knowledge to design the feature interaction module (FIM) and the feature fusion module (FFM) for image decomposition. Furthermore, a coarse-to-fine multi-scale network with residual channel and spatial attention (RCSA) was designed to remove noise from reflectance, suppress color distortion, preserve image details, and adjust the brightness of illumination. An evaluation of various low-light image datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed network is superior in terms of enhancement results.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB Due to the attenuation of underwater light, obtained images often suffer from low contrast, noise interference, and hazy content. In the field of underwater image enhancement, dark channel prior dehazing algorithms have achieved initial success, but they often do not take into account the correlation between different colors and depth. In this paper, we introduce the concept of depth-color correlation based on dark channel prior (DCP), additionally embedding a multi-scale dehazing and denoising module to effectively solve hazy content and noise interference. In particular, the depth-color correlation means that light from different color channels tends to have larger or smaller values as the depth increases. Therefore, we employ the three-bit indicator to represent the depth-color correlation and then further estimate the background light from the different color channels. Because the pyramid layers of the haze image contain varying degrees of noise, our multi-scale dehazing and denoising module decomposes the haze image into a Gaussian pyramid layer and a Laplacian pyramid layer, then dehazes and denoises them layer by layer. Thereafter, the pyramid layers are collapsed to obtain the enhanced image. Finally, in order to reduce the morphological artifacts, we employ the weighted guided filter. Results demonstrate that our method has superior enhancement capabilities compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

DE computer vision; convolutional neural nets; object tracking
AB Accurate target prediction, especially bounding box estimation, is a key problem in visual tracking. Many recently proposed trackers adopt the refinement module called IoU predictor by designing a high-level modulation vector to achieve bounding box estimation. However, due to the lack of spatial information that is important for precise box estimation, this simple one-dimensional modulation vector has limited refinement representation capability. In this study, a novel IoU predictor (IoUNet++) is designed to achieve more accurate bounding box estimation by investigating spatial matching with a spatial cross-layer interaction model. Rather than using a one-dimensional modulation vector to generate representations of the candidate bounding box for overlap prediction, this paper first extracts and fuses multi-level features of the target to generate template kernel with spatial description capability. Then, when aggregating the features of the template and the search region, the depthwise separable convolution correlation is adopted to preserve the spatial matching between the target feature and candidate feature, which makes their IoUNet++ network have better template representation and better fusion than the original network. The proposed IoUNet++ method with a plug-and-play style is applied to a series of strengthened trackers including DiMP++, SuperDiMP++ and SuperDIMP_AR++, which achieve consistent performance gain. Finally, experiments conducted on six popular tracking benchmarks show that their trackers outperformed the state-of-the-art trackers with significantly fewer training epochs.
   This paper proposes a novel IoU predictor (IoUNet++) for visual tracking that uses multi-layer fused spatial template features and depthwise separable convolutional correlations to achieve more accurate bounding box estimation. The tracker improved by the IoUNet++ method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on six popular tracking benchmarks.image

AB Fractional order partial differential equations have a wide range of applications in image processing. The solution of partial differential equations is generally obtained using the finite difference method, which still requires improvement in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, a multi-scale interpolative wavelet operator is constructed by means of Shannon-Cosine wavelets with interpolation, smoothness, compact support and other excellent properties. We use the wavelet operator instead of the finite difference operator to solve fractional-order partial differential equations. The proposed method can limit the artefacts and remove the noises appeared in the processed images effectively. In addition, for the loss of texture in the denoised image, we enhance the image by employing fractional order differential equations to improve the quality of the image. Finally, the biological sections images are taken as the examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB This paper aims to address uncertainty in practical applications that the experimental observations and measurements have nature of inhomogeneity, randomness, and imprecision. This study employs a new method for regression model prediction in an uncertain environment and presents fuzzy parameter estimation of fuzzy regression models using triangular fuzzy numbers. These estimation methods are obtained by new learning algorithms in which linear programming is used. In this study, the new algorithm is a combination of a fuzzy rule-based system, on the basis of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization ACOR. In the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method, the output is crisp. In this research, a hybrid algorithm has been proposed to get the fuzzy output based on linear programming. Meta-heuristic algorithms have been used to reduce the error in the proposed methods based on PSO and ACOR. In addition, two simulation and two practical examples in the field of machining process are applied to indicate the performance of the proposed methods in dealing with crisp input and fuzzy output (CIFO) problems where the observed output variables have the nature of inhomogeneity, randomness, and imprecision. Finally, the results of the proposed algorithms are evaluated. Based on examples, the proposed method is more accurate than the LP and FWLP methods but is not more complicated than the FWLP in computations. Using paired t test, a significant difference was shown between the proposed methods and previous methods, such as LP and FWLP, but there was no significant difference between the two proposed methods ACOR and PSO.

AB Speech-driven 3D human face animation has made admirable progress. However, synthesizing 3D facial speakers with head motion is still an unsolved problem. This is because head motion, as a speech-independent appearance representation, is difficult to model by a speech-driven approach. To solve this problem, we propose 3D head-talk, which generates 3D face animations combined with extreme head motion. In this work, we face a key challenge to generate natural head movements that match the speech rhythm. We first form an end-to-end autoregressive model by combining a dual-tower and single-tower Transformer, with a speech encoder encoding the long-term audio environment, a facial grid encoder encoding subtle changes in the vertices of the 3D facial grid, and a single-tower decoder automatically regressing to predict a series of 3D facial animation grids. Next, the predicted 3D facial animation sequence is edited by a motion field generator containing head motion to obtain an output sequence containing extreme head motion. Finally, the natural 3D face animation under extreme head motion is presented in combination with the input audio. The quantitative and qualitative results show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, and stabilizes the non-area region while maintaining the appearance of extreme head motion.

AB Soft robot deformations are typically estimated using strain sensors to infer change from a nominal shape while taking a robot-specific mechanical model into account. This approach performs poorly during buckling and when material properties change with time, and is untenable for shape-changing robots that don't have a well-defined resting (unactuated) shape. Herein, these limitations are overcome using stretchable shape sensing (S3) sheets that fuse orientation measurements to estimate 3D surface contours without making assumptions about the underlying robot geometry or material properties. The S3 sheets can estimate the shape of target objects to an accuracy of approximate to 3 mm for an 80 mm long sheet. The authors show the S3 sheets estimating their shape while being deformed in 3D space and also attached to the surface of a silicone three-chamber pneumatic bladder, highlighting the potential for shape-sensing sheets to be applied, removed, and reapplied to soft robots for shape estimation. Finally, the S3 sheets detecting their own stretch up to 30% strain is demonstrated. The approach introduced herein provides a generalized method for measuring the shape of objects without making strong assumptions about the objects, thus achieving a modular, mechanics model-free approach to proprioception for wearable electronics and soft robotics.
   To overcome the limitations of soft robot shape-estimation techniques that require robot-specific mechanical models, stretchable shape-sensing (S3) sheets are presented that estimate 3D surface contours in a modular and mechanics model-free manner. The sheets are shown measuring their stretch, various 3D deformations, and the inflation of pneumatic actuators. S3 sheets have applications in wearable electronics and soft robotics.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB This paper discusses a mean-risk index model and the solution algorithm for portfolio selection considering inflation under the uncertain environment. Firstly, we propose an uncertain mean-risk index model considering inflation which is one of the most general multiplicative background risks. To get the optimal solution of the proposed model, we provide a chaos adaptive genetic algorithm (CAGA), which is an improvement of the adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). Through numerical experiments, the performances of the proposed algorithm are tested. Comparison with other genetic algorithms shows the better performance of the proposed algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the application of the proposed model.

AB With the evolution of complexity in decision-making problems, information is increasingly characterized by dynamic updates. Therefore, we introduce the concept of dynamic probabilistic linguistic term set (DPLTS) to solve the multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems with dynamic probabilistic linguistic information characterized by multiple consecutive time points. DPLTS can help experts provide theoretical basis for dynamic decision-making problems. By combining real-time data with analytical models, it can provide decision-makers with effective strategies. Then we present some basic operations and aggregation operators for DPLTSs. The belief interval (BI) interpretation based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and BI measure of DPLTSs are also presented to reduce information uncertainty. After that, we construct two MCGDM methods, including the aggregation-based method and the BI method. We use the concept of time degree to reflect the cognition of the importance of multiple consecutive time points for decision-makers and obtain the time weight vector with the help of a nonlinear programming model. Finally, the proposed methods are applied to a case of pharmaceutical innovation capacity evaluation. By the sensitivity analysis of time degree, the characteristics of the methods are summarized and compared, then the effectiveness of the methods is proved.

AB The quality of the acquired sonar image is generally poor because of the influences of various marine environments, mainly in terms of low resolution and incomplete target edges. To address the difficulties of sonar image segmentation caused by the reasons above, this paper proposes a filtering level-set model for underwater sonar image based on saliency information and gradient information. The model consists of the following three modules. First, the filter fusion module can selectively smooth the noise of sonar image, which reduces the difficulty of subsequent segmentation. Next, the local enhancement module can effectively improve the over-segmentation problem caused by the weak boundary of the target in sonar image. Finally, the level-set segmentation module is proposed in this paper. Weakening the shadow on the results of the above modules can obtain the initial contour closer to the target boundary, which makes the evolution results more accurate. The experimental results show that our model is effective, accurate, and superior to the state of the art.

ID INCENTIVE MECHANISM; ASSIGNMENT; SELECTION
AB A self-evolving reasoning method for task-user relationships based on the autonomic knowledge graph is proposed for the problem of existing task assignment methods, which cannot cope with dynamic environment changes in mobile crowd sensing. In particular, with the idea of "self-reflection," "self-configuration," and "self-adjustment" from autonomic computing, the concept of the autonomic knowledge graph is proposed for the first time. We apply it to build the complete cycle of the knowledge graph, which ensures the dynamic mapping between the task-user relationships in the mobile crowdsensing system. "Self-reflection" generates real-time responses to changes in the internal and external environment of the system. "Self-configuration" selects high-quality sensing users and filters the mobile crowd sensing knowledge graph paths to ensure the reliability of sensing users. Based on the filtered paths, "self-adjustment" computes the neighbor weight matrix of nodes to update node embeddings and exploit potential connections between task-user nodes. Finally, link prediction between task-user nodes achieves accurate and effective task recommendations. This self-evolving reasoning method of nodal relationships we designed combines autonomic computing with the knowledge graph. It forms a continuously operating loop that the next moment of sensing quality is assured and enhanced in the mobile crowd sensing system. Experiments based on the real-world Gollowa dataset, the public Last-FM dataset, and the Amazon-book dataset show that the proposed method can effectively improve sensing data quality and the accuracy of task recommendations.

AB Classification of NIR spectra is a common problem in chemometrics. An ideal classification model should not only classify spectra into the known defined classes but also detect spectra that do not belong to any of the known classes. On top of this, the classification model should also perform well on spectra with unwanted source of variation (batch effects) obtained under different conditions. Classification of spectra into more distinct classes (different edible oils) is relatively easier than classification of spectra into less distinct classes (purities of oils). It is crucial to eliminate the batch effects while keeping the signal that separates the classes in the spectra effectively. Classification of spectra obtained under different batch conditions is often performed by applying a classification model (PCLDA, SIMCA) on spectra adjusted using calibration transfer methods (PDS, CTCCA and PCPDS). However, the simple calibration transfer models are unable to successfully remove the batch effects due to the heterogenous nature of these effects. In this paper, we propose CSCAC, a class-specific correction and classification technique that simultaneously corrects batch effects and performs both multi-class classification and novel-class detection. It provides a simple but an effect way to use calibration transfer models class -specifically when the class of the test spectra is unknown/to-be determined. We built three different versions of CSCAC models with PDS, PCPDS and CTCCA as base transfer models and benchmarked against commonly used classification methods. We show that class-specific framework is worth articulating explicitly and existing methods benefit from being used via such a framework. We illustrate its classification performance on a 14-edible oil dataset obtained across 5 different batches. We further illustrate its ability to be a quality check model on peanut oil - maize oil mixtures obtained across 25 batches.

AB Variable selection is a highly effective approach to improve model performance when analyzing and modeling data from near-infrared spectroscopy. Moving window partial least squares (MWPLS), a well-known and classical wavelength interval selection algorithm, was widely used in the field of near-infrared spectroscopy. However, it has gradually faded from the spotlight due to its limitations. In this study, a modified MWPLS method called interval interaction moving window partial least squares (iMWPLS), was proposed to improve some limitations of MWPLS, including the lack of consideration for the combination effects of variables, the tendency to select redundant wavelength intervals, and the need for artificial intervention. By utilizing the framework of MWPLS, it could iteratively search, test, and add the intervals with the local minimum errors to the set of basic intervals. The method has high sensitivity to the combination effects of variables and enables accurate selection of intervals. Three NIR datasets, including corn starch, pharmaceutical tablets, and soil dataset were tested to evaluate the performance of iMWPLS. The results show that iMWPLS has better performance than other seven wavelength selection methods, including MWPLS, SEPA-MWPLS, fiPLS, biPLS, siPLS, iVISSA, and iRF.

AB A SPME-Arrow GC-MS approach, coupled with chemometrics, was used to thoroughly investigate the impact of different types of yeast (sourdough, bear's yeast and a mixture of both) and their respective leaving time (one, three and five hours) on VOCs of commercial bread samples. This aspect is of paramount importance for the baking industry to adjust recipe modifications and production parameters, as well as to meet consumer needs in formulating new products.A deep learning approach, PARADISe (PARAFAC2-based deconvolution and identification system), was used to analyse the obtained chromatograms in an untargeted manner. In particular, PARADISe, was able to perform a fast deconvolution of the chromatographic peaks directly from raw chromatographic data to allow a putatively identification of 66 volatile organic compounds, including alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes. Finally, Principal Component Analysis, applied on the areas of the resolved compounds, showed that bread samples differentiate according to their recipe and highlighted the most relevant volatile compounds responsible for the observed differences.

AB The stock market is a dynamic, complex, and chaotic environment, which makes predictions for the stock market difficult. Many prediction methods are applied to the stock market, but most are supervised learning and cannot effectively parse the trading information present in the stock market. This paper proposes a prediction model that combines unsupervised learning with reinforcement learning to address this problem. Firstly, we capture the stock trend from historical stock data and construct the trading environment state of the market by the growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm in unsupervised learning. Secondly, the reward function is restructured to provide timely feedback on the trading information present in the stock trading market. Finally, a novel trading agent algorithm, Triple Q-learning, is designed to execute the corresponding trading behavior and make comprehen-sive predictions of the stock market based on the environment state constructed by GNG. Experimental results on several stock datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other comparative models in this paper.

AB The enormous growth of data requires a large amount of storage space in the cloud server, which occupies mostly by the redundant data. The deduplication technique avoids redundancy to utilize cloud storage effectively. Chunking is the process to break the data into chunks, and determine duplicates. Many algorithms exist, to handle the deduplication efficiency, reducing the chunk variance, and improving the computational overhead continue to be a challenging task. To solve the above challenge, we propose a smart chunker (SC) algorithm, which operates with hybrid chunking based on file size as file-level and content-defined chunking (CDC). File-level chunking is assigned only for less than 2 KB file size, and the exceeding file size falls with CDC. We aim optimus prime chunking (OPC) in CDC to break the chunks with prime numbers and involves a minimum number of comparisons with fewer conditions and low computation overhead. This work reduces the processing time without hash and window for computation. Thus, it provides a constant average chunk size to distribute the equal chunk variance in the cloud storage with a 17% reduction in chunk time. Our OPC result attains high throughput of more than 3.3 x, compared to other CDC algorithms.

ID POWER ALLOCATION; COMMUNICATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB The explosion of wireless network services has led to a need for new technologies and resource allocation schemes. Device-to-device (D2D) can reduce the access pressure of base station (BS) equipment, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can multiplex network spectrum resources. The integration of them can further improve the performance of multi-cell networks. However, users still face more interference in multi-cell networks. This paper analyzes the relationship between transmission power and serial interference cancellation decoding order. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate of D2Ds, we propose three feasible frameworks based on the differential evolution (DE) algorithm. First, we invoke a coevolution DE-based resource allocation (CDRA) framework, which encodes the RB assignment and power allocation into the same individual for evolution. Second, we propose an iteration-combining DE-based resource allocation (IDRA) framework, which adopts a two-step DE algorithm to solve optimal power allocation and RB assignment scheme iteratively. Lastly, we invoke the power-repairing DE-based resource allocation (PDRA) framework, which can perform power repair on individuals with failed evolution. Simulation results demonstrate that: (1) the integration of D2D and NOMA techniques is capable of enhancing the achievable sum rate of D2Ds; (2) the three proposed frameworks for multi-cell NOMA networks can effectively optimize the objective function. Compared with CDRA and IDRA, PDRA performs better in terms of convergence speed and maximum D2D rate.

DE Matrix games; SVTrN numbers; CLPP; Primal-dual pair
ID NONLINEAR-PROGRAMMING APPROACH; FUZZY
AB Seikh and Dutta (Soft Comput 26: 921-936, 2022) claimed that there does not exist any approach to solve single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic (SVTrN) matrix games (matrix games in which each payoff is represented by a SVTrN number). To fill this gap, Seikh and Dutta, firstly, proposed SVTrN non-linear programming problems (NLPPs) corresponding to Player-I and Player-II. Then, Seikh and Dutta proposed two different approaches to transform the proposed SVTrN NLPPs into crisp linear programming problems (CLPPs). Finally, Seikh and Dutta claimed that an optimal solution of the transformed CLPPs also represents an optimal solution of SVTrN NLPPs. Brikaa (Soft Comput 26: 9137-9139, 2022) pointed out that a mathematically incorrect result is considered in Seikh and Dutta's first approach to transform SVTrN NLPPs into CLPPs. Therefore, the transformed CLPPs are not equivalent to SVTrN NLPPs. Hence, it is mathematically incorrect to assume that an optimal solution of the transformed CLPPs also represents an optimal solution of SVTrN NLPPs. Brikaa also proposed an approach to transform the SVTrN NLPPs into CLPPs. In this paper, it is pointed out that on solving the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa's approach corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, different optimal value is obtained. Also, it is pointed out that on solving the CLPPs, obtained by Seikh and Dutta's second approach corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, a different optimal value is obtained. However, in the actual case, the obtained optimal value should be the same as in the literature; it is proved that the CLPPs corresponding to Player-I and Player-II represent a primal-dual pair. This indicates that neither the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa's approach nor the CLPPs, obtained by Seikh and Dutta's second approach, are equivalent to the SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II. Hence, it is inappropriate to use the CLPPs, obtained by Brikaa's approach as well as Seikh and Dutta's second approach to find an optimal solution for the SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II. Also, Brikaa's approach as well as Seikh and Dutta's second approach is modified to transform SVTrN NLPPs into their equivalent CLPPs. Furthermore, it is proved that the CLPPs corresponding to SVTrN NLPPs of Player-I and Player-II, obtained by the proposed modified approaches, represent a primal-dual pair. Finally, the correct result of a SVTrN matrix game, considered by Seikh and Dutta to illustrate their approaches, is obtained by the proposed modified approaches.

AB In the process of facial expression recognition, face detection is the prerequisite, image preprocessing is the foundation, facial expression feature extraction is the key, and facial expression classification is the target. Effective feature extraction in this process can improve the accuracy of facial expression classifications. On the other hand, traditional facial expression recognition methods are not only complicated in the feature extraction process, but also unable to obtain more in-depth high-semantic features and deep features from the original image. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a facial expression recognition method based on multi-channel fusion and lightweight neural network. First, a cascade classifier based on Haar features is used to detect the face region of the facial expression image. Second, the local binary pattern (LBP) is used to extract the local texture features from the face region. Third, face edge features are simultaneously obtained by performing edge detection in the face region based on the Canny edge detection algorithm. Fourth, the obtained face image, LBP texture feature image, and edge detection Canny image are fused, and the fused image is input into the constructed lightweight neural network for training and recognition. Experiments are carried out on the public image databases Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (Fer2013) and extended Cohn-Kanade (CK +) using the hold-out cross-validation method. The experimental results show that the proposed method effectively extracts more complete image features by combining traditional feature extraction algorithms with deep learning feature extraction algorithms, improves the accuracy and robustness of facial expression recognition, and has better recognition rate and generalization ability compared to other mainstream methods.

AB Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals show the electrical activity of the brain, which are one of the inputs of the brain-computer interface (BCI). The BCI provides the communication path between the brain and the computer. One of the critical applications of BCI is Motor imagery (MI). MI is a mental process that a person practices or simulates a particular movement without physically acting. BCI allows the person to communicate with their environment independently of peripheral muscles and nerves, using EEG brain signals by assistive devices such as wheelchairs, robotic arms, and computers. In this paper, a space learning concept is proposed for EEG motor imagery signal classification. Our innovation in the proposed method is to increase and then, reduce the data dimensions, which has led to learning the efficient space for signals classification. It is based on two techniques: Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) and dimension reduction. The composite kernel is made of a combination of four kernels by The Heuristic MKL Algorithm. This algorithm uses heuristic rules to estimate the weight of kernels with high accuracy and very little computational complexity. The weight associated with each base kernel and its parameters is calculated by the Equilibrium Optimizer. Dimensions of data are reduced to avoid the curse of dimensions. In this step, the number of dimensions of reduced space and the mapping matrix are learned to reduce the dimensions of data linearly. We selected ELM, KNN, and SVM classifiers for classification. The BCI Competition dataset was used for evaluation, which consists of five subsets aa, al, ay, aw, av, and two classes of the right hand and right foot. The proposed method with the ELM was improved the average classification accuracy and standard deviation by 3.9% and 2.28, respectively, and achieved 91.4% accuracy. The lower standard deviation than other methods shows that our method is more robust than all other methods to subject variety. The proposed method is compared with twelve state-of-the-art methods and has shown higher accuracy than other methods such as the deep convolutional neural networks. The results show the superiority of the proposed method over other methods in the Wilcoxon signed test.

AB In this paper, fixed-time convergent RNNs with logarithmic settling time are proposed for solving time-variant quadratic programming (QP), where the domain of attraction of the RNN models can be reasonably estimated a priori. Two novel activation functions are designed, and the exact expressions of the settling time functions for each given initial condition are given; and upper bounds of the settling times for any given initial condition can be obtained. In addition, the generic activation functions are constructed and analyzed to achieve logarithmic fixed-time settling. The RNNs based on the generic activation function are designed, which have a faster convergence rate and a fixed-time convergence property. By estimating the bound of the settling time function under given initial conditions in the bounded region, the semi-global fixed-time convergence of the RNN model is in turn established. It is shown that the predefined-time convergence of modified RNN models can be assured by adopting the inverse of the bound. Simulation results verify effectiveness of the proposed computing schemes for the time-variant QP problem solving and the repetitive motion planning of a redundant manipulator.

AB Traditional model-based control methods require accurate system dynamics. However, the dynamics are usually unknown and it is challenging to tune the control parameters manually when controlling a complex nonlinear system. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning method that combines the advantages of a model-based method, namely Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP), with the actor-critic method. Specifically, a linear approximate model is chosen to obtain the estimated dynamics as part of the optimal policy. Then, a designed actor-critic structure is used to obtain the sub-policy. We provide the theoretical proof of convergence and validate the proposed method through simulation experiments. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with smaller tracking errors and faster learning speed compared with the controller trained by the actor-critic method.

AB Frailty is associated with poor post-operative outcomes. However, frailty assessments in clinical practice are challenging due to the need for more resources and pragmatic complexities. We aimed to create a pre-operative frailty ascertainment using machine learning (ML) from electronic health record (EHR) data that is built on the Fried frailty phenotype. We leveraged a research database of 8,999 individuals aged 65 years and above who underwent a surgery. Healthcare providers administered a pre-operative frailty assessment using the Fried frailty phenotype. We built ML models to predict pre-operative frailty as a whole and by surgical service. We used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the results. Comparisons with the accumulated deficit approach were made using Pearson's correlation coefficients and McNemar's test. The ML model achieved an AUC of 0.74 in predicting pre-operative frailty phenotype. The ML models' predictive power varied by surgical services, with AUC ranging from 0.63 to 0.81. SHAP showed that advanced age, anemia, chronic pulmonary disease, and literacy deficit were the most important features of pre-operative frailty. The ML model had similar performance to the accumulated deficit approach, with positive correlation (r: 0.36-0.58, P> 0.001) between frailty risk scores predicted by ML and frailty indices obtained from the accumulated deficit approach. Our approach provided new insights into the importance of specific EHR features in pre-operative frailty assessment. ML may offer an alternative method to predict frailty in pre-operative settings. Further validation on external data sources is required to generalize our ML models.

AB Since the advent of JSON as a popular format for exchanging large amounts of data, a novel category of NoSQL database systems, named JSON document stores, has emerged for storing JSON data sets; in fact, these novel databases are able to natively manage collections of JSON documents. To help analysts and data engineers query and integrate JSON data sets persistently saved in JSON document stores, the J-CO Framework has been developed (at the University of Bergamo, Italy): it is built around a novel query language, named J-CO-QL(+), that provides sophisticated features, including soft-querying capabilities. However, J-CO-QL(+ )(as the other languages for querying JSON data sets) is designed to be general purpose; consequently, it can be cumbersome for users to apply it on specific data formats. This is the case of GeoJSON, a specific and popular JSON data format that is designed to represent geographical information layers. This paper presents the latest evolution of GeoSoft, a novel high-level "domain-specific language" that is specifically designed to express complex queries on the GeoJSON documents, including soft-queries. GeoSoft is inspired to the classical SQL language, so as to reduce the learning curve of potential users. GeoSoft queries are translated into J-CO-QL(+ )scripts, to be actually executed.

AB Convolutional neural networks are widely used for feature extraction in signal recognition. A critical issue in convolutional neural networks is the loss of information which increases with the depth of the network. To reduce information loss, this paper proposes a downsampling operator based on wavelet transforms, in which all wavelet components are fused as an output. The corresponding weights of the components are computed via signal back-propagation of the neural network. Meanwhile, a denoising rule of soft-threshold is devised for all wavelet components to achieve multi-channel adaptive denoising of the signal in the frequency domain. More precisely, the thresholds in each frequency band are optimised using a gradient descent algorithm so that the reconstructed signal carries information from each frequency band of the original signal while the noise is filtered out. Based on this, a 1-level wavelet feature extraction structure consisting of 1-stride convolution and full-component wavelet downsampling operation is designed. Finally, with a number of experiments on signal recognition, the proposed algorithm achieves favourable performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

   inspection; Process monitoring; Anomaly detection
AB With the rapid development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, quality inspection has become one of the most crucial research topics in additive manufacturing. Although numerous image-based deep learning methods have been successfully developed to monitor and inspect AM product quality effectively, many require substantial labels in order to achieve satisfactory training, which is often impractical in real-life AM processes. In this article, a novel image feature-based self-supervised learning (IFSSL) model is proposed for effective quality inspection in AM. Through a feature-based image fusion approach based on defect-relevant feature extraction, the IFSSL model is able to guide machine vision to focus on highlighted defect-relevant regions in the AM product image. In addition, the defect-relevant features are used to generate pseudo-labels for self-supervised learning. With self-supervision, the IFSSL model leverages the advantages of supervised learning and unsupervised learning by requiring no sample label while retaining defect-relevant information. The effectiveness of the proposed IFSSL method is demonstrated through a real case study of fused deposition modeling product image dataset. Results show that the IFSSL model can guide machine vision to pay more attention to potential defective regions, enabling it to detect and locate faults effectively and automatically for machine vision guided quality inspection.

AB The popular word-filling game Wordle has gained widespread attention since its release in 2022. Much attention has been paid to find the optimal strategy. However, this article proposes a black-box prediction model that can accurately predict the difficulty level of words in the game to find the deep rules in the game data. In this work, we scientifically established a black-box model for game difficulty prediction. We achieve high accuracy in new datasets and show strong stability in similar tasks. The black-box model is divided into the game input content feature extraction model and the game output content rule extraction model. This research scientifically and effectively extracts word attributes, including word frequency, letter frequency, part of speech, times of letter repetitions, and word meaning score from the input content. Then it reduces the seven kinds of proportion of people in different tries in output content into two indices using the Critic method. Finally, it establishes a gradient boosting decision tree-based multiple regression model, making the final prediction accuracy of difficulty level for new words reach 95%. It is believed that the black-box prediction model can provide valuable insights for game designers and developers. And the research provides an innovative method to predict and understand user behavior in online games, contributing to the broader field of data science. The integration of data-driven methodologies in the gaming industry opens new possibilities for understanding player interactions and further enhancing game development strategies.

AB Deep learning models are nowadays broadly deployed to solve an incredibly large variety of tasks. However, little attention has been devoted to connected legal aspects. In 2016, the European Union approved the General Data Protection Regulation which entered into force in 2018. Its main rationale was to protect the privacy and data protection of its citizens by the way of operating the so-called "Data Economy". As data is the fuel of modern Artificial Intelligence, it is argued that the GDPR can be partly applicable to a series of algorithmic decision-making tasks before a more structured AI Regulation enters into force. In the meantime, AI should not allow undesired information leakage deviating from the purpose for which is created. In this work, we propose DisP, an approach for deep learning models disentangling the information related to some classes we desire to keep private, from the data processed by AI. In particular, DisP is a regularization strategy de correlating the features belonging to the same private class at training time, hiding the information about private class membership. Our experiments on state-of-the-art deep learning models show the effectiveness of DisP, minimizing the risk of extraction for the classes we desire to keep private.

ID PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; GAUSSIAN-PROCESSES; MACHINES
AB In this paper, we propose a kernel principal component analysis model for multi-variate time series forecasting, where the training and prediction schemes are derived from the multi-view formulation of Restricted Kernel Machines. The training problem is simply an eigenvalue decomposition of the summation of two kernel matrices corresponding to the views of the input and output data. When a linear kernel is used for the output view, it is shown that the forecasting equation takes the form of kernel ridge regression. When that kernel is non-linear, a pre-image problem has to be solved to forecast a point in the input space. We evaluate the model on several standard time series datasets, perform ablation studies, benchmark with closely related models and discuss its results.

ID ACTION LOCALIZATION; NETWORK
AB Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is a basic and complex task in video understanding. It aims at detecting both the localization and category of actions in a video. The anchor-free TAD methods directly predict the action classes at each location and regress the distances to the boundaries. However, current anchor-free models based on convolutional neural network encode spatiotemporal sequences by 3D convolution networks. Due to the limited receptive field and the basic prior of the translation invariance, effective long temporal sequence modeling cannot be achieved. As a result, these methods cannot effectively detect temporal boundaries. To solve this problem, we design a novel end-to-end self-attention temporal enhancement TAD model, which introduces the Temporal Enhancement module to enhance the temporal feature encoding of the videos and expand the receptive field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the self-attention Temporal Enhancement model yields an effective improvement on previous work, which improves the performance on THUMOS14 by 1.2%, reaching 53.2% on average mAP. Meanwhile, a competitive result of 34.7% average mAP is achieved on ActivityNet-1.3.

DE Anti-spoofing; Spoof dataset; Parallel branched architecture
ID IMAGE
AB Spoof detection in complex real-world conditions has always been challenging for the face anti-spoofing research community. Most existing datasets need more practical variations for spoof detection in the wild and thus generate the need for a more complex dataset encompassing the required diversities. The single image-based anti-spoofing solutions for face recognition systems sometimes suffer from inconclusiveness in scenarios with cluttered backgrounds or variable illumination. To address these issues, we first collected a diverse spoof detection dataset, CSDiNE, with a wide range of illumination intensities and background variations. Secondly, we proposed a jointly supervised parallel branched neural network, JS-SpoofNet, that utilizes temporal cues derived from a video sequence for robust spoof detection. JS-SpoofNet consists of a parallel branched architecture with a spoof classification network aided by an auxiliary network that utilizes intermediate features from the main branch for depth estimation. We conducted an elaborate ablation study and performed an extensive performance evaluation of our proposed method. On the in-house CSDiNE dataset, the proposed spoof detector attained a minimum average classification error rate (ACER) of 0.94%. Furthermore, the designed neural network outperformed existing video-based state-of-the-art spoof detection methods on popular diverse benchmark datasets.

TI CaPTURe: Cartoon Pose Transfer Using Reverse Attention
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Generative Adversarial Network; Cartoon pose transfer; Attention;
   Reverse attention
AB Most of the previous pose transfer methods require additional input data such as joint keypoints of the target pose extracted by a pre-trained network in a human domain. However, in the fields where cartoon characters are used, such as animation or webtoons, the body proportions and structures of the characters often deviate from those of real-life humans. Therefore, it is not appropriate to utilize a pre-trained network designed for the human domain to extract additional data from these cartoon characters. Even if the network is newly trained in the cartoon domain, expensive data labeling is necessary. As a result, most of the previous pose transfer methods are not suitable for application in the cartoon domain. To address these issues, we propose a cartoon pose transfer network named CaPTURe that can successfully perform pose transfer in the cartoon domain with only target images and no other input data. Here, we incorporate the attention mechanism to accurately generate the desired identity. Additionally, we employ reverse attention to enhance the precision of generating the target pose. This approach eliminates the influence of identity information in the pose feature, enabling our network to focus solely on utilizing pose information. Consequently, through comparative experiments using a cartoon domain dataset, CaPTURe shows significant improvements in quantitative results over the previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it achieves a 4.7% reduction in L1 Distance, a 0.1% improvement in SSIM, and a 0.8% enhancement in LPIPS. Moreover, CaPTURe exhibits superior qualitative performance than the previous state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we demonstrate that CaPTURe is capable of achieving effective pose transfer not just in the cartoon domains, but also in the human domains, as evidenced by our experiments on a human domain dataset.

Our approach relies on multiple notions of data proximity, making it suitable for handling mixed data types or incorporating domain knowledge. Our method also reduces the computational costs of pairwise proximity calculations, resulting in improved efficiency and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on graph and sequence datasets from the biochemical domain. In particular, we show that the method can efficiently be combined with interpretable machine learning approaches like relevance-based learning vector quantization for sophisticated classification learning.

DE Chinese spelling check; Multi-task training; Comparative learning
AB The task of Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) is to identify and correct spelling errors in text, which are mainly caused by phonologically and visually similar characters. Although pre-trained language models are helpful for this task, they lack phonological and visual information. Previous works have primarily focused on identifying errors based on local contextual data, while neglecting the importance of sentence-level information. To address the above issues, Contrastive Learning Spell (CLSpell) is proposed, which combines phonetic and glyphic information through contrastive learning and simultaneously acquires local and global information through multitask joint learning. During pretraining, token representations are learned using a combination of phonological, visual, and semantic information. Moreover, we propose to include an auxiliary task of correct sentence discrimination in the multi-task joint training process to capture sentence-level information. Experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses all competing methods.

AB With the increase of computational power and memory capacity, it is possible to record and analyse lots of features of different nature in real time or in a data stream manner. Nonetheless, in many applications, not all variables may be relevant to explain the nature of the data. Feature subset selection strategies are therefore required to extract the relevant features to understand the data generating process. Much work has been performed in the area of supervised classification problems regarding feature selection, whereas for unsupervised environments, scarce studies have been conducted. In current feature subset selection methodologies for unsupervised data streams, the set of relevant variables are reevaluated or forgotten whenever a new instance or chunk of data arrives: this approach can be computationally expensive or unnecessary. Therefore, in this article, we provide a method to perform feature subset selection in unsupervised data streams. An embedded feature subset selection methodology based on asymmetric hidden Markov models and novel concept discovery strategies is used. This methodology can be used to detect novel concepts in data, and update the set of relevant features when a drift in the data stream is detected. Thus, the relevant variables are updated only when needed. To make this possible, we provide a model for batch and online problems, that is capable of dynamically determining the relevant variables to address feature selection in data streams. Additionally, the model provides domain insights using context-specific Bayesian networks which can be helpful to understand the dynamic process. To validate the proposed methodology, synthetic and real data from ball-bearings are used. Additionally, the proposed methodology is compared with other state of the art methodologies. The proposed method can be used to update the relevant features when needed and is more stable than its competitors.

AB Contemporary deep learning methods for image reconstruction have shown promising results over classical methods. However, they are not robust to image alterations due to deviations in the imaging conditions at test time. The training process does not account for explicit variations in the contextual information about the imaging task, such as image control parameters and input settings that could hold a causal relationship to the visual content of the reconstructed image. In this work, we propose dynamic weight prediction (DWP) networks to learn the contextual settings and the relationships between them. This model-based meta-learning approach would offer two valuable capabilities in a single network - (i) scalability to multiple input settings and (ii) tunability to continuously varying control settings with the knowledge of a few settings. The proposed network, MCI-HyperNet, is a controllable image reconstruction network with DWP sub-networks conditioned on multiple contextual settings. The proposed approach strikes a balance between reliable context-adaptive weight learning and context-agnostic weight learning to obtain robust image reconstructions. We have extensively experimented with our network for accelerated MRI reconstruction considering the essential research directions provided in the fastMRI challenge results. The proposed method exhibits (i) superior reconstruction quality with improvement margins of similar to 0.5 dB in PSNR and similar to 0.01 in SSIM over adaptive reconstruction methods for cardiac MRI and multiple brain MRI contrasts, (ii) better scalability to multiple anatomies, contrasts, and under-sampling mask patterns with accuracy improvement margins of similar to 0.2 dB in PSNR and similar to 0.005 in SSIM over joint training and context-specific models for knee MRI, and (iii) generality to 40 arbitrary acceleration factors over joint training when trained on just five acceleration factors. Our model can learn multiple contrast sequences through continual learning without catastrophically forgetting old MRI sequences. Furthermore, our method is benchmarked for reconstruction quality against other MRI reconstruction architectures trained for a specific contextual setting. Besides, an interpretability analysis using a relational knowledge distillation measure shows that our model exhibits superior context-specific and relational knowledge across contexts over jointly trained models.

AB Reinforcement learning faces the challenge of sparse rewards. Existing research utilizes reward shaping based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) to address this challenge. However, the automatic construction of optimal graph has been a long standing issue. Here we propose Graph Convolution with Topology Refinement for Automatic Reinforcement Learning (GTR), based on the construction of new latent graph to replace the original input graph for more effective reward shaping. It is found from this work that, the most suitable state node can be extracted through the graph entropy. Subsequently we map the original graph to subset of nodes adaptively to form a new and more compact latent graph. Since GTR utilizes trainable projection vectors for projecting all node features into one-dimensional representation, the inter-connections between the nodes of the newly constructed latent graph are consistent with the original ones. The proposed GTR stems from mathematical grounds, and preliminary experiments have shown that the proposed GTR has considerable improvement on Atari benchmark and Mujoco benchmark. Further experiment and ablation analysis have given further supports to this work.

TI MARN: Multi-level Attentional Reconstruction Networks for Weakly

DE Multimodal learning; Weakly-supervised learning; Deep neural networks;
   Video temporal grounding
AB Video temporal grounding is a challenging task in computer vision that involves localizing a video segment semantically related to a given query from a set of videos and queries. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised model called the Multi-level Attentional Reconstruction Networks (MARN), which is trained on video-sentence pairs. During the training phase, we leverage the idea of attentional reconstruction to train an attention map that can reconstruct the given query. At inference time, proposals are ranked based on attention scores to localize the most suitable segment. In contrast to previous methods, MARN effectively aligns video-level supervision and proposal scoring, thereby reducing the training-inference discrepancy. In addition, we incorporate a multi-level framework that encompasses both proposal-level and clip-level processes. The proposal-level process generates and scores variable-length time sequences, while the clip-level process generates and scores fix-length time sequences to refine the predicted scores of the proposal in both training and testing. To improve the feature representation of the video, we propose a novel representation mechanism that utilizes intra-proposal information and adopts 2D convolution to extract inter-proposal clues for learning reliable attention maps. By accurately representing these proposals, we can better align them with the textual modalities, and thus facilitate the learning of the model. Our proposed MARN is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, and extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.

TI Scale-Aware Frequency Attention network for super-resolution
SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Scale-arbitrary image super-resolution; Frequency domain learning
ID IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION
AB Scale-arbitrary super-resolution (SASR) has recently gained widespread attention in the community, which aims to super-resolve an image to arbitrary desired resolutions. Existing SASR methods always use a fixed convolution neural network (CNN) as the backbone to share the same image features for different resolutions, leading to limited reconstruction performance due to the lack of distinctive feature extraction for individual resolutions. Meanwhile, these CNN-based methods always tend to overfit low-frequency components while losing high-frequency ones. This frequency gap leads to blurred structures in the reconstructed image. To address these issues, we propose a Scale Aware Frequency Attention network (SAFANet), which consists of Scale-Aware Frequency Attention (SAFA) modules and a Scale-Guided Continuous Reconstruction (SGCR) module. Additionally, frequency-domain attention learning is introduced to optimize the scale-adapted features to explicitly focus on high-frequency components, thereby overcoming the frequency restoration gap. Finally, the SGCR module combines the input scale as guidance with the optimized features to reconstruct images with arbitrary resolutions by using an implicit reconstruction function, thus adaptively achieving continuous image restoration. Our proposed SAFANet can be easily incorporated into existing CNN-based SR networks to achieve interactive SR at arbitrary scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAFANet achieves superior performance, which is competitive with or even better than the state-of-the-art methods across a vast scale range (x1 & SIM; x30) via a single model.

AB A key challenge in computer vision and deep learning is the definition of robust strategies for the detection of adversarial examples. In this work, we propose the adoption of ensemble approaches to leverage the effectiveness of multiple detectors in exploiting distinct properties of the input data. To this end, the ENsemble Adversarial Detector (ENAD) framework integrates scoring functions from state-of-the-art detectors based on Mahalanobis distance, Local Intrinsic Dimensionality, and One-Class Support Vector Machines, which process the hidden features of deep neural networks. ENAD is designed to ensure high standardization and reproducibility to the computational workflow.Extensive tests on benchmark datasets, models and adversarial attacks show that ENAD outperforms all competing methods in the large majority of settings. The improvement over the state-of-the-art and the intrinsic generality of the framework, which allows one to easily extend ENAD to include any set of detectors and integration strategies, set the foundations for the new area of ensemble adversarial detection.

AB Density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm is a new algorithm based on density clustering analysis, which can quickly obtain the cluster centers by drawing the decision diagram by using the calculation of local density and relative distance. Without prior knowledge and iteration, the parameters and structure are simple and easy to implement. Since it was proposed in 2014, it has attracted a large number of researchers to explore experiments and improve applications in recent years. In this paper, we first analyze the theory of DPC and its performance advantages and disadvantages. Secondly, it summarizes the improvement of DPC in recent years, analyzes the improvement effect, and shows it with experimental data. The related application research of DPC in different fields is introduced. Finally, the clustering results of DPC, LCDPC, DCHDPC and NADPC algorithms in different data sets are analyzed. Experiments show that the improved algorithm can divide the clustering more accurately, which provides new ideas for improving DPC algorithm in the future. At the same time, this paper summarizes and prospects the improvement and development of DPC.

AB 0-1 knapsack problem (KP01) is one of the classic variants of knapsack problems in which the aim is to select the items with the total profit to be in the knapsack. In contrast, the constraint of the maximum capacity of the knapsack is satisfied. KP01 has many applications in real-world complex problems such as resource distribution, portfolio optimization, etc. This study reviews the basic theory and main algorithms of 0-1 knapsack, proposes many different types of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, and divides existing 0-1 knapsack problems into 6 types according to the different coding methods of the algorithms, for a comprehensive overview of it. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the recent advances in 0-1 knapsack problem is presented. Literature survey reveals some interesting challenges and future research directions.

AB The event-triggered adaptive neural networks (NNs) tracking control issue is considered in this paper for a type of incommensurate fractional-order systems (IFOSs) with disturbance. Unlike the existing works for IFOSs, the hypothesis of disturbance-like function and the frequency distributed model are avoided in this study by utilizing the continuity of fractional-order derivative (FOD). Then, based on the radial basis function (RBF) NNs and backstepping method, the adaptive control scheme is proposed to ensure that the reference signal can be tracked by the system output, where the derivative order of adaptive laws does not depend on the one of IFOS. Additionally, to further reduce the burden of communication network, an exponentially convergent term is introduced into traditional dynamic event-triggered mechanism (ETM) and the Zeno behavior is avoided. Finally, two illustrative examples are exhibited to verify the performance of designed control scheme.

ID SINGLE IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION
AB Watching low resolution standard dynamic range (LR SDR) video on a 4K high dynamic range (HDR) TV is not the best viewing experience. Joint super-resolution (SR) and SDRTV-to-HDRTV aims to enhance the visual quality of LR SDR videos that have quality deficiencies in resolution and dynamic range. Previous methods that rely on learning local information typically cannot do well in preserving color conformity and long-range structural similarity, resulting in unnatural color transition and texture artifacts. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a global priors guided modulation network (GPGMNet). In particular, we design a global priors extraction module (GPEM) to extract color conformity prior and structural similarity prior that are beneficial for SDRTV-to-HDRTV and SR tasks, respectively. To further exploit the global priors and preserve spatial information, we devise multiple global priors-guided spatial-wise modulation blocks (GSMBs) with a few parameters for intermediate feature modulation. In these GSMBs, the modulation parameters are generated by the shared global priors and the spatial features map from the spatial pyramid convolution block (SPCB). With these elaborate designs, the GPGMNet can achieve higher visual quality with lower computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GPGMNet is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our proposed model exceeds the state-of-the-art by 0.64 dB in PSNR, with 69% fewer parameters and 3.1x speedup.

AB High-dimensional and incomplete (HDI) data are frequently encountered in big date-related applications for describing restricted observed interactions among large node sets. How to perform accurate and efficient representation learning on such HDI data is a hot yet thorny issue. A latent factor (LF) model has proven to be efficient in addressing it. However, the objective function of an LF model is nonconvex. Commonly adopted first-order methods cannot approach its second-order stationary point, thereby resulting in accuracy loss. On the other hand, traditional second-order methods are impractical for LF models since they suffer from high computational costs due to the required operations on the objective's huge Hessian matrix. In order to address this issue, this study proposes a generalized Nesterov-accelerated second-order LF (GNSLF) model that integrates twofold conceptions: 1) acquiring proper second-order step efficiently by adopting a Hessian-vector algorithm and 2) embedding the second-order step into a generalized Nesterov's acceleration (GNA) method for speeding up its linear search process. The analysis focuses on the local convergence for GNSLF's nonconvex cost function instead of the global convergence has been taken; its local convergence properties have been provided with theoretical proofs. Experimental results on six HDI data cases demonstrate that GNSLF performs better than state-of-the-art LF models in accuracy for missing data estimation with high efficiency, i.e., a second-order model can be accelerated by incorporating GNA without accuracy loss.

AB Cutter planning and control are the crucial problems in machining processes. The current literature indicates that the issue of cutter planning and control problem was not adequately researched in the past in a metal-cutting process. Usually, cutter planning and control problems were addressed using different optimization, simulation, and computer-aided planning (CAP) methods. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study proposed a decision support system (DSS) that can integrate fuzzy case-based reasoning (F-CBR) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (F-AHP) methods. This integration was applied to determine hybrid similarity measures between new and prior cases. The study provides new insights into the integration of fuzzy set theory (FST), CBR, and AHP for solving machining cutter planning and control problems. Our proposed system retrieves the best similar prior cases to reuse and adapt them to new order arrivals. A numerical example was illustrated to validate the soundness of the researched DSS.

ID EXPRESSION RECOGNITION; DEEP
AB The importance of facial expressions in nonverbal communication is significant because they help better represent the inner emotions of individuals. Emotions can depict the state of health and internal wellbeing of individuals. Facial expression detection has been a hot research topic in the last couple of years. The motivation for applying the convolutional neural network-10 (CNN-10) model for facial expression recognition stems from its ability to detect spatial features, manage translation invariance, understand expressive feature representations, gather global context, and achieve scalability, adaptability, and interoperability with transfer learning methods. This model offers a powerful instrument for reliably detecting and comprehending facial expressions, supporting usage in recognition of emotions, interaction between humans and computers, cognitive computing, and other areas. Earlier studies have developed different deep learning architectures to offer solutions to the challenge of facial expression recognition. Many of these studies have good performance on datasets of images taken under controlled conditions, but they fall short on more difficult datasets with more image diversity and incomplete faces. This paper applied CNN-10 and ViT models for facial emotion classification. The performance of the proposed models was compared with that of VGG19 and INCEPTIONV3. The CNN-10 outperformed the other models on the CK + dataset with a 99.9% accuracy score, FER-2013 with an accuracy of 84.3%, and JAFFE with an accuracy of 95.4%.

AB The objective is to explore the value of artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic system-assisted CT examination combined with serum tumor markers in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. 150 patients with pulmonary nodules diagnosed and treated in our hospital from April 2021 to September 2022 were selected and divided into benign group (n = 48) and malignant group (n = 102) according to postoperative pathological examination results. Logistic regression analysis was applied to analyze relationships among clinical and imaging features as well as benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. To observe the diagnostic value of AI-assisted CT combined with serum tumor markers for benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Results showed that the multi-variate Logistic regression analysis indicated that spicule sign, vascular convergence sign and calcification were risk factors for malignant pulmonary nodules (P < 0.05). The sensitivity (97.06%) and accuracy (91.33%) of serum tumor markers combined with CT in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules were higher than those of each alone. The Kappa index of combined diagnosis was higher than that of single diagnosis. Kappa index = 0.793, which was in good consistency with pathological diagnosis results. The conclusion is that the sensitivity and accuracy of AI diagnostic system-assisted CT examination combined with serum tumor markers in the diagnosis of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules are high, which has perfect consistency with pathological diagnosis results.

AB The subject of assessing the relative efficiency of Decision-Making Units (DMUs) has been explored extensively in the literature on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). While typical DEA models require exact and conclusive data, the observed values of the inputs and outputs in real-world problems may be inaccurate or ambiguous. This paper presents a novel fully fuzzy DEA (FFDEA) model based on the additive slacks-based measure (ASBM). FFDEA models imply that all inputs, outputs, and variables, are fuzzy. It is demonstrated how fuzzy ranking and fuzzy arithmetic approaches can be used to handle the trapezoidal fuzzy number assumptions. To solve the fuzzy ASBM model under variable returns-to-scale assumptions, we proposed two different methods, first method use of lexicographic method for solving multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) approach, which provides an efficiency measure and a fuzzy goal operating point for each DMU under assessment. In alternative method, we convert the fuzzy linear fractional programming problems to an equivalent MOLP problem. A case study is provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach for selecting sustainable suppliers, we compare the results with other fuzzy DEA approaches, while shedding light on future research venues.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for stabilizing fractional-order (FO) nonlinear systems with distributed time-varying delays and input constraints. It utilizes an interval type-2 fuzzy systems (IT2FS) to effectively manage uncertainties and complexities in the system. By combining various theories, a new methodology is proposed for designing a stabilization controller. Sufficient conditions guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system, addressing challenges of varying delays and controller saturation. The results are expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), facilitating implementation with the Matlab LMIs toolbox. This study contributes to advancing control theory by developing stabilization techniques for fractional nonlinear systems.

AB IntroductionIn the realm of basketball, refining shooting skills and decision-making levels using intelligent agents has garnered significant interest. This study addresses the challenge by introducing an innovative framework that combines multi-modal perception and deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to create basketball robots capable of executing precise shots and informed choices by effectively integrating sensory inputs and learned strategies.MethodsThe proposed approach consists of three main components: multi-modal perception, deep reinforcement learning, and end-to-end architecture. Multi-modal perception leverages the multi-head attention mechanism (MATT) to merge visual, motion, and distance cues for a holistic perception of the basketball scenario. The deep reinforcement learning framework utilizes the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, enabling the robots to learn optimal shooting strategies over iterative interactions with the environment. The end-to-end architecture connects these components, allowing seamless integration of perception and decision-making processes.ResultsThe experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Basketball robots equipped with multi-modal perception and deep reinforcement learning exhibit improved shooting accuracy and enhanced decision-making abilities. The multi-head attention mechanism enhances the robots' perception of complex scenes, leading to more accurate shooting decisions. The application of the DQN algorithm results in gradual skill improvement and strategic optimization through interaction with the environment.DiscussionThe integration of multi-modal perception and deep reinforcement learning within an end-to-end architecture presents a promising avenue for advancing basketball robot training and performance. The ability to fuse diverse sensory inputs and learned strategies empowers robots to make informed decisions and execute accurate shots. The research not only contributes to the field of robotics but also has potential implications for human basketball training and coaching methodologies.

AB This article studies the diffusion-source-inference (DSI) problem, whose solution plays an important role in real-world scenarios such as combating misinformation and controlling diffusions of information or disease. The main task of the DSI problem is to optimize an estimator, such that the real source can be more precisely targeted. In this article, we assume that the state of a number of nodes, called observer set, in a network could be investigated if necessary, and study what configuration of those nodes could facilitate a better solution for the DSI problem. In particular, we find that the conventional error distance metric cannot precisely evaluate the effectiveness of varied DSI approaches in heterogeneous networks, and thus propose a novel and more general measurement, the candidate set, that is formulated to contain the diffusion source for sure. We propose the percolation-based evolutionary framework (PrEF) to optimize the observer set such that the candidate set can be minimized. Hence, one could further conduct more intensive investigation or search on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first theoretically show that the size of the candidate set is bounded by the size of the largest component cover, and demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSI problem and the network immunization problem. We find that, given the associated direction information of the diffusion is known on observers, the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both synthetic and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve much smaller candidate sets compared to the state of the art in almost all cases, e.g., it is better in 26 out of 27 empirical networks and 155 out of 162 cases regarding the critical threshold. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it works well irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and underlying networks. More importantly, we provide a framework for the analysis of the DSI problem in large-scale networks.

AB ConceFT (concentration of frequency and time) is a new time-frequency (TF) analysis method which combines multitaper technique and synchrosqueezing transform (SST). This combination produces highly concentrated TF representations with approximately perfect time and frequency resolutions. In this paper, it is aimed to show the TF representation performance and robustness of ConceFT by using it for the classification of the epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Therefore, a signal classification algorithm which uses TF images obtained with ConceFT to feed the transfer learning structure has been presented. Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that millions of people suffer worldwide. Daily lives of the patients are quite difficult because of the unpredictable time of seizures. EEG signals monitoring the electrical activity of the brain can be used to detect approaching seizures and make possible to warn the patient before the attack. GoogLeNet which is a well-known deep learning model has been preferred to classify TF images. Classification performance is directly related to the TF representation accuracy of the ConceFT. The proposed method has been tested for various classification scenarios and obtained accuracies between 95.83% and 99.58% for two and three-class classification scenarios. High results show that ConceFT is a successful and promising TF analysis method for non-stationary biomedical signals.

AB This study proposes a discrete mathematical Susceptible-Exposed-Preinfectious-Infectious-Recovered (SEPIR) states model for seasonal influenza. In a previous study, focusing on infections by preinfectious people using preexisting data, the author showed that the super-spreading of seasonal influenza occurred before the day that the first patients were discovered (D-day). In addition, when people do not take precautionary measures, the infectivity rate (from preinfected people) was determined as 0.041. After D-day in the community, the implementation of countermeasures was observed to reduce the infectivity rate to 0.002 and 0.013 in working and living spaces, respectively. The number of infectious people can be estimated by summing up each group in the community. This study performed a multiagent simulation (MAS) of seasonal influenza from preinfectious people in closed spaces based on decomposability. Then, the basic simulation is validated and the appropriateness of infective rates, changed infectivity rates, and near decomposability is confirmed.

DE Clustering; Multipartite network
AB The clustering problem is one of the most studied and challenging in machine learning, as it attempts to identify similarities within data without any prior knowledge. Among modern clustering algorithms, the network-based ones are some of the most popular. Most of them convert the data into a graph in which instances of the data represent the nodes and a similarity measure is used to add edges. This article proposes a novel approach that uses a multipartite network in which layers correspond to attributes of the data and nodes represent intervals for the data. Clusters are intuitively constructed based on the information provided by the paths in the network. Numerical experiments performed on synthetic and real-world benchmarks are used to illustrate the performance of the approach. As a real application, the method is used to group countries based on health, nutrition, and population information from the World Bank database. The results indicate that the proposed method is comparable in performance with some of the state-of-the-art clustering methods, outperforming them for some data sets.

AB High-precision image segmentation of the spine in computed tomography (CT) images is important for the diagnosis of spinal diseases and surgical path planning. Manual segmentation is often tedious and time consuming. Thus, an automatic segmentation algorithm is expected to solve this problem. However, because different areas are scanned, the number of spines in the original CT image and the coverage area are often different, making it extremely difficult to directly conduct a fully autonomous spine segmentation. In this study, we propose a two-stage automatic spine segmentation method based on 3D Swin Transformer. In the first stage, the 3D Swin-YoloX algorithm is used to achieve an accurate positioning of each spine segment in the CT images. In the second stage, 3D Swin-UNet is used to achieve a high-precision segmentation of the spine. Using an open dataset, the average Dice of our approach can reach 0.942 and the average Hausdorff distance can reach 6.24, indicating a higher accuracy in comparison with other published methods. Our proposed method can effectively eliminate any adverse effects of the different scanning areas on a spinal image segmentation and has a high application value.

AB Every year, wildfires accentuated by global warming, cause economic and ecological losses, and often, human casualties. Increasing operational capacity of firefighter crews is of utmost importance to better face the forest fire period that yearly occurs. In this study, we investigate the real-world firefighters timetabling problem of the INFOCA institution, Andalusia (Spain). The main issue is to achieve maximum operational capability while taking into account work regulation constraints. This paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation that makes it feasible to solve small/medium instances to optimality. We put forward a matheuristic (ILPH) based on the ILP formulation, and we obtain solutions for larger instances. We propose an Adaptive Large Neighbourhood Search metaheuristic (ALNS) to obtain better results for larger instances and we use a version of the ILPH as one of the constructive methods. The ALNS obtains all the optimal solutions found by the ILP on small instances. It yields better solutions than the ILPH matheuristic on larger instances within shorter processing times. We report on experiments performed on datasets generated using real-world data of the INFOCA institution. The work was initiated as part of the GEO-SAFE project.

ID TRACKING; SYSTEM
AB Welding is a fabrication process used to join or fuse two mechanical parts. Modern welding machines have automated lasers that follow a predefined weld seam path between the two parts to create a bond. Previous efforts have used simple computer vision edge detectors to automatically detect the weld seam on an image at the junction of two metals to be welded. However, these systems lack reliability and accuracy resulting in manual human verification of the detected edges. This paper presents a neural network architecture that automatically detects the weld seam edge between two metals with high accuracy. We augment this system with a preclassifier that filters out anomalous workpieces (e.g., incorrect placement). Finally, we justify our design choices by evaluating against several existing deep network pipelines as well as proof through real-world use. We also describe in detail the process of deploying the system in a real-world shop floor including evaluation and monitoring. We make public a large well-labeled laser seam dataset to perform deep learning-based edge detection in industrial settings.

AB This paper argues, against the prevailing view, that consent to privacy policies that regular internet users usually give is largely unproblematic from the moral point of view. To substantiate this claim, we rely on the idea of the right not to know (RNTK), as developed by bioethicists. Defenders of the RNTK in bioethical literature on informed consent claim that patients generally have the right to refuse medically relevant information. In this article we extend the application of the RNTK to online privacy. We then argue that if internet users can be thought of as exercising their RNTK before consenting to privacy policies, their consent ought to be considered free of the standard charges leveled against it by critics.

AB The investigation of neural network convergence represents a pivotal and indispensable area of research, as it plays a crucial role in unraveling the universal approximation capability and the intricate structural complexity inherent in these systems. In this study, we delve into an innovative and generalized convex incremental iteration method, which surpasses previous studies by offering a more expansive formulation capable of encompassing a broader range of weight parameters. Moreover, we rigorously and systematically demonstrate the convergence rate of this convex iteration technique, shedding light on its reliability and effectiveness. Furthermore, we adopt a discrete statistical perspective to effectively tackle the challenges arising from the non-compactness of input data and the inherent unknowability of the objective function in practical settings, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of our research. To support our conclusions, we introduce two implementation algorithms, namely back propagation and random search. The latter algorithm plays a vital role in preventing the neural network from becoming entrapped in suboptimal local minima during the training process. Finally, we present comprehensive results obtained from a variety of regression problems, which not only serve as empirical evidence of the superior performance of our algorithms but also validate their alignment with our theoretical predictions. These results contribute significantly to the advancement of our understanding of neural network convergence and its profound implications for the universal approximation capability inherent in these complex systems.

AB The human brain receives stimuli in multiple ways; among them, audio constitutes an important source of relevant stimuli for the brain regarding communication, amusement, warning, etc. In this context, the aim of this manuscript is to advance in the classification of brain responses to music of diverse genres and to sounds of different nature: speech and music. For this purpose, two different experiments have been designed to acquire EEG signals from subjects listening to songs of different musical genres and sentences in various languages. With this, a novel scheme is proposed to characterize brain signals for their classification; this scheme is based on the construction of a feature matrix built on relations between energy measured at the different EEG channels and the usage of a bi-LSTM neural network. With the data obtained, evaluations regarding EEG-based classification between speech and music, different musical genres, and whether the subject likes the song listened to or not are carried out. The experiments unveil satisfactory performance to the proposed scheme. The results obtained for binary audio type classification attain 98.66% of success. In multi-class classification between 4 musical genres, the accuracy attained is 61.59%, and results for binary classification of musical taste rise to 96.96%.

AB This paper formulates multi-objective (MO) generation scheduling problem of an integrated energy system (IES). The integrated energy system comprises combined heat and power (CHP), hydroelectric, thermal and heat units. The interdependency of heat and power in CHP units, water transport delay among various multi-chain hydroelectric units and valve point loading effect of thermal units makes the generation scheduling problem a complex, constrained, discontinuous, non-differentiable and multimodal optimization problem. The main motive of this research work is to concurrently reduce the overall generation cost and pollutant emissions emitted by various generating units. The generation scheduling problem is treated as a MO problem owing to the contradictory nature of these objectives. Thus, a very proficient hybrid optimization approach, i.e., quantum-based cuckoo search algorithm (QCSA) with mutation operators, is proposed for searching for the optimal generation schedule of the MO-integrated energy system generation scheduling (IESGS) problem. The proposed technique significantly improves the solutions obtained by QCSA by utilizing three mutation operators, i.e., Cauchy, Gaussian, and opposition-based mutation. The proposed strategy has been implemented to MO-hydroelectric-thermal (HT) generation scheduling and MO-IESGS problems to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The cardinal priority method is utilized for finding the most suitable non-dominated solution for both problems. The obtained results are comparatively better than the published results. The proposed approach's robustness compared to the QCSA has been further verified using the t-test. Based on comparisons and statistical analysis, the proposed technique is a promising approach for handling complex, multi-dimensional and non-convex generation scheduling optimization problems.

AB Very sensitive loads require the safe operation of electrical distribution networks, including hospitals, nuclear and radiation installations, industries used by divers, etc. To address this issue, the provided paper suggests an innovative method for evaluating the appropriate allocation of Distribution STATic COMpensator (DSTATCOM) to alleviate total power losses, relieve voltage deviation, and lessen capital annual price in power distribution grids (PDGs). An innovative approach, known as the modified capuchin search algorithm (mCapSA), has been introduced for the first time, which is capable of addressing several issues regarding optimal DSTATCOM allocation. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process method approach is suggested to generate the most suitable weighting factors for the objective function. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed mCapSA methodology and the performance of DSTATCOM, it has been tested on two standard buses, the 33-bus PDG and the 118-bus PDG, with a load modeling case study based on real measurements and analysis of the middle Egyptian power distribution grid. The proposed mCapSA technique's accuracy is evaluated by comparing it to other 7 recent optimization algorithms including the original CapSA. Furthermore, the Wilcoxon sign rank test is used to assess the significance of the results. Based on the simulation results, it has been demonstrated that optimal DSTATCOM allocation contributes greatly to the reduction of power loss, augmentation of the voltage profile, and reduction of total annual costs. As a result of optimized DSTATCOM allocation in PDGs, distribution-level uncertainties can also be reduced.

DE Person Re-ID; Unsupervised learning; Uncertainty estimation
AB Existing state-of-the-art unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods rely on clustering to generate pseudo labels for training. The reliability of pseudo labels directly affects the performance of these methods. Due to unsatisfactory feature embedding and imperfect clustering, pseudo labels are not always reliable that significantly hinder the representation learning of person. To address this issue, an Uncertainty-guided Robust labels refinement method is proposed. It employs uncertainty as guidance to selects and optimizes unreliable pseudo labels, which alleviates the impact of incorrect pseudo labels. Specially, an uncertainty estimation module is constructed, which identifies the samples with low reliability applies base on consistency between the ideal distribution and the predicted distribution. To mitigate the impact of unreliable samples, the labels refinement module is designed, which rebuilds labels for low reliability samples by measuring similarity from the closest centroid. Thanks to the reliability of pseudo labels provided by uncertain estimation module, the proposed method enhances robustness to noisy labels and learns discriminative representations of person. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and achieves advanced performance for unsupervised person Re-ID.

AB Recently, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has received considerable interest in graph representation learning for its robustness in capturing complex relationships between nodes in an unsupervised manner, making it suitable for unsupervised graph learning tasks such as community detection. However, most GCL approaches have two limitations when applied to community detection. First, the random augmentation strategy employed by them may destroy a graph's community structure due to the random added/removed edges or attributes. Second, nodes with similar topology or attributes may be selected as the negative samples of a target node according to their sample selection strategy, leading to the wrong assignment of the target node's community. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-graph-contrastive-learning-based community detection (AGCLCD) algorithm to address the problems. At its core, AGCLCD introduces an adaptive graph augmentation strategy to preserve a graph's original community structure in augmentation. Furthermore, we develop a composite contrastive pair selection scheme to choose the nodes sharing similar topology and attributes with a target node as its positive samples to ensure that the representation vectors of nodes in the same community are highly relevant. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic networks demonstrate that AGCLCD achieves higher accuracy and effectiveness than state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB User-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) is a popular technique in recommendation systems, where rating estimations for unrated items are based on the rating information of each neighboring user. However, conventional similarity measures for identifying the neighboring users often overlook the user's contribution in rating predictions for unrated items. This leads to limited coverage in rating predictions. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel similarity metric that effectively incorporates the degree of user contribution to unrated item predictions, thereby enhancing coverage. Additionally, the proposed approach assigns varying weights to items based on their rating frequency, further improving coverage. Extensive experiments were conducted on six benchmark datasets to validate the proposed approach. The results showed that the proposed similarity measure improved the recommendations and significantly expanded the coverage of predictable items. Furthermore, the proposed similarity enhances diversity in recommendations, contributing to a more robust and effective recommendation system.

AB Traffic flow prediction is an essential part of the intelligent traffic management system, which can help managers plan and maintain traffic order and individuals choose better travel routes. Due to the complex spatio-temporal correlation of large-scale transportation networks, it is challenging to build accurate and efficient prediction models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal grammar graph attention network with adaptive edge information for traffic flow prediction. The external structure of the prediction model uses a grammar graph structure based on three grammar rules to capture the interactive relationship between various traffic parameters. The internal structure uses a graph attention network with adaptive edge information for synchronous extraction of the spatio-temporal dependence of historical traffic information. The two real data sets simulation results show that the model's prediction accuracy is better than the existing prediction methods in different scale traffic networks.

ID RECOGNITION
AB License plate detection is an important task in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and has a wide range of applications in vehicle management, traffic control, and public safety. In order to improve the accuracy and speed of mobile recognition, an improved lightweight YOLOv5s model is proposed for license plate detection. First, an improved Stemblock network is used to replace the original Focus layer in the network, which ensures strong feature expression capability and reduces a large number of parameters to lower the computational complexity; then, an improved lightweight network, ShuffleNetv2, is used to replace the backbone network of the YOLOv5s, which makes the model lighter and ensures the detection accuracy at the same time. Then, a feature enhancement module is designed to reduce the information loss caused by the rearrangement of the backbone network channels, which facilitates the information interaction in the feature fusion process; finally, the low-, medium- and high-level features in the Shufflenetv2 network structure are fused to form the final high-level output features. Experimental results on the CCPD dataset show that compared to other methods this paper obtains better performance and faster speed in the license plate detection task, in which the average precision mean value reaches 96.6%, and can achieve a detection speed of 43.86 frame/s, and the parameter volume is reduced to 5.07 M.
   1. Improved Stemblock structure to reduce the number of parameters.2. Improve Shufflunetv2 as the backbone network and reduce the number of parameters.3. The attention mechanism is added to the network to improve the detection accuracy.image

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in dynamic hand gestures as a natural means of human-computer interaction. However, existing methods for recognizing dynamic gestures have certain limitations, particularly in consistently capturing and focusing on the hand movement region across various motion patterns. This research paper presents LMNet, an innovative and efficacious network comprising the Long-term Aggregation Module and the Motion Excitation Module. The Motion Excitation Module exploits motion information extracted from neighboring frames to amplify motion-sensitive channels, while the Long-term Aggregation Module harnesses dynamic convolution to assimilate temporal information from diverse motion patterns. Rigorous experimentation conducted on the EgoGesture and Jester datasets demonstrates that LMNet surpasses the majority of prevailing approaches in terms of accuracy, while concurrently upholding an optimal computational cost.

AB Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored and executed on a blockchain platform. However, previous studies demonstrated that developing secure smart contracts is not easy. Unfortunately, the use of insecure smart contracts results in a significant financial loss for service providers or customers. Therefore, identifying security vulnerabilities in smart contracts would be essential in blockchain platforms using smart contracts. In this paper, we present SmartConDetect as a tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. SmartConDetect is a static analysis tool that extracts code fragments from Solidity smart contracts and uses a pre-trained BERT model to find susceptible code patterns. To demonstrate the performance of SmartConDetect, we use two public datasets, and our dataset (SmartConDataset) collected from the real-world Ethereum blockchain network. Our experimental results show that SmartConDetect significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods, achieving 90.9% F1-score when using our own dataset. Specifically, SmartConDetect is about 2 times faster than SmartCheck in detection. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world case study to analyze the distribution of detected vulnerabilities.

AB Hearing loss is becoming a global problem, partly as a consequence of exposure to loud music. People may be unaware about the harmful sound levels and consequent damages caused by loud music at venues such as discotheques or festivals. Earplugs are effective in reducing the risk of noise-induced hearing loss but have been shown to be an insufficient prevention strategy. Thus, when it is not possible to lower the volume of the sound source, a viable solution to the problem is to relocate to quieter locations from time to time. In this context, this study introduces a bracelet device with the goal of warning users when the music sound level is too loud in their specific location, via haptic, visual or visuo-haptic feedback. The bracelet embeds a microphone, a microcontroller, an LED strip and four vibration motors. We performed a user study where thirteen participants were asked to react to the three kinds of feedback during a simulated disco club event where the volume of music pieces varied to reach a loud intensity. Results showed that participants never missed the above threshold notification via all types of feedback, but visual feedback led to the slowest reaction times and was deemed the least effective. In line with the findings reported in the hearing loss prevention literature, the perceived usefulness of the proposed device was highly dependent on participants' subjective approach to the topic of hearing risks at loud music events as well as their willingness to take action regarding its prevention. Ultimately, our study shows how technology, no matter how effective, may not be able to cope with these kinds of cultural issues concerning hearing loss prevention. Educational strategies may represent a more effective solution to the real problem of changing people's attitudes and motivations to want to protect their hearing.

AB Effective spatio-temporal modeling as a core of video representation learning is challenged by complex scale variations in spatio-temporal cues in videos, especially different visual tempos of actions and varying spatial sizes of moving objects. Most of the existing works handle complex spatio-temporal scale variations based on input-level or feature-level pyramid mechanisms, which, however, rely on expensive multistream architectures or explore multiscale spatio-temporal features in a fixed manner. To effectively capture complex scale dynamics of spatio-temporal cues in an efficient way, this article proposes a single-stream architecture (SS-Arch.) with single-input namely, adaptive multi-granularity spatio-temporal network (AMS-Net) to model adaptive multi-granularity (Multi-Gran.) Spatio-temporal cues for video action recognition. To this end, our AMS-Net proposes two core components, namely, competitive progressive temporal modeling (CPTM) block and collaborative spatio-temporal pyramid (CSTP) module. They, respectively, capture fine-grained temporal cues and fuse coarse-level spatio-temporal features in an adaptive manner. It admits that AMS-Net can handle subtle variations in visual tempos and fair-sized spatio-temporal dynamics in a unified architecture. Note that our AMS-Net can be flexibly instantiated based on existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the proposed CPTM block and CSTP module. The experiments are conducted on eight video benchmarks, and the results show our AMS-Net establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on fine-grained action recognition (i.e., Diving48 and FineGym), while performing very competitively on widely used Something-Something and Kinetics.

AB Sixty percent of elderly hand movements involve grasping, which is unarguably why grasp restoration is a major component of upper-limb rehabilitation therapy. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is effective in assisting grasping, but challenges around patient engagement and control, as well as poor movement regulation due to fatigue and muscle nonlinearity continue to hinder its adoption for clinical applications. In this study, we integrate an electroencephalography-based brain-machine interface (BMI) with closed-loop neuromuscular stimulation to restore grasping and evaluate its performance using an isometric force tracking task. After three sessions, it was concluded that the normalized tracking error during closed-loop stimulation using a state-space feedback controller (25 +/- 15%), was significantly smaller than conventional open-loop stimulation (31 +/- 24%), (F (748.03, 1) = 23.22, p < 0.001). Also, the impaired study participants were able to achieve a BMI classification accuracy of 65 +/- 10% while able-bodied participants achieved 57 +/- 18% accuracy, which suggests the proposed closed-loop system is more capable of engaging patients for rehabilitation. These findings demonstrate the multisession performance of model-based feedback-controlled stimulation, without requiring frequent reconfiguration.

ID COLOR IMAGE WATERMARKING
AB Watermarking has been developed as a beneficial approach to resolve security problems such as copyright defense, legitimate ownership, and authenticity of digital data. Grayscale or binary images and color images are the most important types of embedded watermarks in the existing video watermarking schemes, while dark frame watermarking is barely used. A new robust blind video watermarking system with an Advanced Squeezed Convoluted Ebola Neural Network (ASCENN) approach is suggested to secure copyright, reduce noise, and authenticate the authenticity of dark frames. The proposed method selects the dark frames from the extracted input video. Then the selected dark frames are embedded and extracted using Finite Ridgelet Transform (FRT), All Phase Discrete Cosine Biorthogonal Transform (APDCBT), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques. The robustness of the introduced approach is established by evaluating it through various image watermarking techniques and evaluating its performance against geometric, nongeometric, and combinational attacks. While comparing with the other existing video watermarking approaches, the proposed method has obtained a maximum correlation coefficient of 1, and the signal-to-noise ratio of 75dB, at minimum error rate of 0.0215, respectively.

AB This paper addresses the challenge of poor cross-domain generalization performance in deep learning methods for stereo matching, particularly when dealing with unseen scenes or disparity maps lacking ground-truth information. To overcome this issue, we propose a self-supervised network called SANet. The network integrates a lightweight algorithm, AANet_Edge, which is based on depth edges optimization. In SANet, we combine AANet_Edge with a novel algorithm called SDCO, which efficiently extracts depth edges using a segment structure and employs a two-layer optimization framework to generate accurate dense disparity maps. These maps are then utilized for pixel-by-pixel supervised training. Furthermore, SANet incorporates multi-scale reconstructed left maps and multi-scale edges-aware modules to learn the structural features of the input image. To evaluate the effectiveness of SANet, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two standard benchmark datasets, namely KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015. The experimental results demonstrate that SANet produces accurate disparity maps for unseen scenes or limited images and achieves high cross-domain generalization performance.

TI Evaluating the Impact of Time-to-Collision Constraint and Head Gaze on
   Usability for Robot Navigation in a Corridor
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Crossing; human-robot interaction; legibility; navigation; usability
AB Navigation of robots among humans is still an open problem, especially in confined locations (e.g. narrow corridors, doors). This article aims at finding how an anthropomorphic robot, like a PR2 robot with a height of 1.33 m, should behave when crossing a human in a narrow corridor in order to increase its usability. Two experiments studied how a combination of robot head behavior and navigation strategy can enhance robot legibility. Experiment 1 aimed to measure where a pedestrian looks when crossing another pedestrian, comparing the nature of the pedestrian: human or a robot. Based on the results of this experiment and the literature, we then designed a robot behavior exhibiting mutual manifestness by both modifying its trajectory to be more legible, and using its head to glance at the human. Experiment 2 evaluated this behavior in real situations of pedestrians crossing a robot. The visual behavior and user experience of pedestrians were assessed. The first experiment revealed that humans primarily look at the robot's head just before crossing. The second experiment showed that when crossing a human in a narrow corridor, both modifying the robot trajectory and glancing at the human is necessary to significantly increase the usability of the robot. We suggest using mutual manifestness is crucial for an anthropomorphic robot when crossing a human in a corridor. It should be conveyed both by altering the trajectory and by showing the robot awareness of the human presence through the robot head motion. Small changes in robot trajectory and manifesting robot perception of the human via a user identified robot head can avoid users' hesitation and feeling of threat.

AB IntroductionRecent advancements in reinforcement learning algorithms have accelerated the development of control models with high-dimensional inputs and outputs that can reproduce human movement. However, the produced motion tends to be less human-like if algorithms do not involve a biomechanical human model that accounts for skeletal and muscle-tendon properties and geometry. In this study, we have integrated a reinforcement learning algorithm and a musculoskeletal model including trunk, pelvis, and leg segments to develop control modes that drive the model to walk.MethodsWe simulated human walking first without imposing target walking speed, in which the model was allowed to settle on a stable walking speed itself, which was 1.45 m/s. A range of other speeds were imposed for the simulation based on the previous self-developed walking speed. All simulations were generated by solving the Markov decision process problem with covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, without any reference motion data.ResultsSimulated hip and knee kinematics agreed well with those in experimental observations, but ankle kinematics were less well-predicted.DiscussionWe finally demonstrated that our reinforcement learning framework also has the potential to model and predict pathological gait that can result from muscle weakness.

AB Visualizing and examining the intellectual landscape and evolution of scientific communities to support collaboration is crucial for multiple research purposes. In some cases, measuring similarities and matching patterns between research publication document sets can help to identify people with similar interests for building research collaboration networks and university-industry linkages. The premise of this work is assessing feasibility for resolving ambiguous cases in similarity detection to determine authorship with natural language processing (NLP) techniques so that crowdsourcing is applied only in instances that require human judgment. Using an NLP-crowdsourcing convergence strategy, we can reduce the costs of microtask crowdsourcing while saving time and maintaining disambiguation accuracy over large datasets. This article contributes a next-gen crowd-artificial intelligence framework that used an ensemble of term frequency-inverse document frequency and bidirectional encoder representation from transformers to obtain similarity rankings for pairs of scientific documents. A sequence of content-based similarity tasks was created using a crowd-powered interface for solving disambiguation problems. Our experimental results suggest that an adaptive NLP-crowdsourcing hybrid framework has advantages for inter-researcher similarity detection tasks where fully automatic algorithms provide unsatisfactory results, with the goal of helping researchers discover potential collaborators using data-driven approaches.

ID COMPARATIVE CORRELATIVES
AB Construction Grammar (CxG) is a paradigm from cognitive linguistics emphasizing the connection between syntax and semantics. Rather than rules that operate on lexical items, it posits constructions as the central building blocks of language, i.e., linguistic units of different granularity that combine syntax and semantics. As a first step toward assessing the compatibility of CxG with the syntactic and semantic knowledge demonstrated by state-of-the-art pretrained language models (PLMs), we present an investigation of their capability to classify and understand one of the most commonly studied constructions, the English comparative correlative (CC). We conduct experiments examining the classification accuracy of a syntactic probe on the one hand and the models' behavior in a semantic application task on the other, with BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa as the example PLMs. Our results show that all three investigated PLMs, as well as OPT, are able to recognize the structure of the CC but fail to use its meaning. While human-like performance of PLMs on many NLP tasks has been alleged, this indicates that PLMs still suffer from substantial shortcomings in central domains of linguistic knowledge.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB Navigating safely and efficiently in dense crowds remains a challenging problem for mobile robots. The interaction mechanisms involved in collision avoidance require robots to exhibit active and foresighted behaviors while understanding the crowd dynamics. Deep reinforcement learning methods have shown superior performance compared to model-based approaches. However, existing methods lack an intuitive and quantitative safety evaluation for agents, and they may potentially trap agents in local optima during training, hindering their ability to learn optimal strategies. In addition, sparse reward problems further compound these limitations. To address these challenges, we propose SafeCrowdNav, a comprehensive crowd navigation algorithm that emphasizes obstacle avoidance in complex environments. Our approach incorporates a safety evaluation function to quantitatively assess the current safety score and an intrinsic exploration reward to balance exploration and exploitation based on scene constraints. By combining prioritized experience replay and hindsight experience replay techniques, our model effectively learns the optimal navigation policy in crowded environments. Experimental outcomes reveal that our approach enables robots to improve crowd comprehension during navigation, resulting in reduced collision probabilities and shorter navigation times compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/Janet-xujing-1216/SafeCrowdNav.

Social media has proven to be one of the most useful data sources when it comes to understanding a company's potential audience to drive more targeted impact. Navigating through an ocean of information is a tedious task where techniques such as artificial intelligence and text analytics have proven effective in identifying relevant posts for healthcare business questions. Here, we present an enterprise-ready, scalable solution demonstrating the feasibility and utility of social media-based patient experience data for use in research and development through capturing and assessing patient experiences and expectations on disease, treatment options, and unmet needs while creating a playbook for roll-out to other indications and therapeutic areas.

We show how to obtain better alpha mattes by incorporating into our framework semantic classification of matting regions. Specifically, we consider and learn 20 classes of general matting patterns, and propose to extend the conventional trimap to semantic trimap. The proposed semantic trimap can be obtained automatically through patch structure analysis within trimap regions. Meanwhile, we learn a multi-class discriminator to regularize the alpha prediction at semantic level, and content-sensitive weights to balance different regularization losses. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method outperforms other methods benefit from such general alpha semantics and has achieved the most competitive state-of-the-art performance. We further explore the effectiveness of our method on specific semantics by specializing our method into human matting and transparent object matting. Experimental results on specific semantics demonstrate alpha matte semantic information can boost performance for not only general matting but also class-specific matting. Finally, we contribute a large-scale Semantic Image Matting Dataset constructed with careful consideration of data balancing across different semantic classes. Code and dataset are available in https://github.com/nowsyn/SIM.

AB We investigate the scaled position consensus of high-order multiagent systems with parametric uncertainties over switching directed graphs, where the agents' position states reach a consensus value with different scales. The intricacy arises from the asymmetry inherent in information interaction. Achieving scaled position consensus in high-order multiagent systems over directed graphs remains a significant challenge, particularly when confronted with the following complex features: 1) uniformly jointly connected switching directed graphs; 2) complex agent dynamics with unknown inertias, unknown control directions, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances; 3) interacting with each other via only relative scaled position information (without high-order derivatives of relative position); and 4) fully distributed in terms of no shared gains and no global gain dependency. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed adaptive algorithm based on a MRACon scheme, where a linear high-order reference model is designed for every individual agent employing relative scaled position information as input. A new transformation is proposed which converts the scaled position consensus of high-order linear reference models to that of first-order ones. Theoretical analysis is presented where agents' positions achieve the scaled consensus over switching directed graphs. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the efficacy of our algorithm and some collective behaviors on traditional consensus, bipartite consensus, and cluster consensus are shown by precisely choosing the scales of the agents.

AB The existence of redundancy in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enables us to remove some filters/channels with acceptable performance drops. However, the training objective of CNNs usually tends to minimize an accuracy-related loss function without any attention paid to the redundancy, making the redundancy distribute randomly on all the filters, such that removing any of them may trigger information loss and accuracy drop, necessitating a fine-tuning step for recovery. In this article, we propose to manipulate the redundancy during training to facilitate network pruning. To this end, we propose a novel centripetal SGD (C-SGD) to make some filters identical, resulting in ideal redundancy patterns, as such filters become purely redundant due to their duplicates, hence removing them does not harm the network. As shown on CIFAR and ImageNet, C-SGD delivers better performance because the redundancy is better organized, compared to the existing methods. The efficiency also characterizes C-SGD because it is as fast as regular SGD, requires no fine-tuning, and can be conducted simultaneously on all the layers even in very deep CNNs. Besides, C-SGD can improve the accuracy of CNNs by first training a model with the same architecture but wider layers and then squeezing it into the original width.

AB With the flourish of the Internet of Things (IoT), the group communication Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) emerged at the historic moment, enabling homogeneous devices with constrained computing ability to communicate with ease. CoAP is widely used in transportation, health care and many other aspects. Hence, it is prominent to propose a flexible and efficient architecture for usage in such scenarios and study the data security and consistency of the architecture from the perspective of formal methods. In this paper, we extend the group communication CoAP model to the enhanced group communication CoAP by the introduction of smart gateways and binding to new security suites. We make further improvements to increase the scalability and flexibility of the architecture, making it more applicable in a healthcare scenario or smart home scenario. And we adopt process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) with real-time extension to model the enhanced group communication CoAP. We use model checker PAT to verify eight properties of our model on an abstract level, including four basic properties and four security properties. We also conduct a simulation on the local machine for validation of the above properties on a more detailed level. Despite some simplifications of physical properties, both results of the verification and simulation show that the proposed architecture can satisfy those requirements and demonstrate a good possibility of being securely put into service.

TI Enhancing Code Summarization with Graph Embedding and Pre-trained Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING

DT Article; Early Access
DE Code summarization; pre-trained model; code structure; deep learning
AB Code summarization is a task that aims at automatically producing descriptions of source code. Recently many deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed to generate accurate code summaries, among which pre-trained models (PTMs) for programming languages have achieved promising results. It is well known that source code written in programming languages is highly structured and unambiguous. Though previous work pre-trained the model with well-design tasks to learn universal representation from a large scale of data, they have not considered structure information during the fine-tuning stage. To make full use of both the pre-trained programming language model and the structure information of source code, we utilize Flow-Augmented Abstract Syntax Tree (FA-AST) of source code for structure information and propose GraphPLBART - Graph-augmented Programming Language and Bi-directional Auto-Regressive Transformer, which can effectively introduce structure information to a well PTM through a cross attention layer. Compared with the best-performing baselines, GraphPLBART still improves by 3.2%, 7.1%, and 1.2% in terms of BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, respectively, on Java dataset, and also improves by 4.0%, 6.3%, and 2.1% on Python dataset. Further experiment shows that the structure information from FA-AST has significant benefits for the performance of GraphPLBART. In addition, our meticulous manual evaluation experiment further reinforces the superiority of our proposed approach. This demonstrates its remarkable abstract quality and solidifies its position as a promising solution in the field of code summarization.

AB In recent years, the increased population has led to an increase in the demand for various industrially processed edibles and other consumable products. These industries regularly alter the proteins found in raw materials to generate more commercially viable end-products in order to keep up with consumer demand. These modifications result in a substance that may cause allergic reactions in consumers, thereby creating a protein allergen. The detection of such proteins in various substances is essential for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of allergic conditions. Bioinformatics and computational methods can be used to analyze the information contained in amino-acid sequences to detect possible allergens. The article presents a deep learning based ensemble approach to identify protein allergens using Extra Tree, Deep Belief Network (DBN), and CatBoost models. The proposed ensemble model achieves higher detection accuracy by combining the prediction results of the three models using majority voting. The evaluation of the proposed model was carried out on the benchmark protein allergen dataset, and the performance analysis revealed that the proposed model outperforms the other state-of-the-art literature techniques with a protein allergen detection accuracy of 89.16%.

AB Artificial intelligence has a plethora of applications in the realm of biomedical sciences, such as pattern recognition, diagnosis of disease, human-machine interaction, medical image processing, robotic limbs, or exoskeletons. Robotic limbs, or exoskeletons, are widely employed to assist with lower limb movement. To increase the exoskeleton's flexibility in the lower extremities, it is critical to recognize the diverse motion intents of the lower limbs of the human body. In this investigation, sEMG signals from lower limb muscles are used for a computer-aided recognition system to correctly identify the lower limb activities because these signals can identify movement ahead of time and enable faster detection of signal fluctuation than other wearable sensors. Several types of noise are introduced into the signal during collection. A multistage classification strategy is proposed to overcome the processing challenges associated with these sEMG signals. Initially, nine time-domain handcrafted features are retrieved using a hybrid of wavelet denoising and ensemble empirical mode decomposition approach with a sliding window of 256 ms and a 25% overlap. Next, a Pearson correlation-based graph is formed from the extracted features and applied to a graph neural network (GNN). GNN not only captures individual information but also makes use of information from other samples to form a graph. The combination of a Pearson correlation-based graph with a GNN is referred to as Pearson correlation-based GNN. The observation states that the approach proposed in the research achieved an accuracy of 99.19%, 99.02%, 96.21% for the walking, sitting, and standing of healthy subjects, while 99.29%, 97.97%, 99.36% for the subjects comprising knee abnormalities, respectively.

AB Accurate lung lesion segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images is crucial to the analysis and diagnosis of lung diseases, such as COVID-19 and lung cancer. However, the smallness and variety of lung nodules and the lack of high-quality labeling make the accurate lung nodule segmentation difficult. To address these issues, we first introduce a novel segmentation mask named "soft mask", which has richer and more accurate edge details description and better visualization, and develop a universal automatic soft mask annotation pipeline to deal with different datasets correspondingly. Then, a novel network with detailed representation transfer and soft mask supervision (DSNet) is proposed to process the input low-resolution images of lung nodules into high-quality segmentation results. Our DSNet contains a special detailed representation transfer module (DRTM) for reconstructing the detailed representation to alleviate the small size of lung nodules images and an adversarial training framework with soft mask for further improving the accuracy of segmentation. Extensive experiments validate that our DSNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for accurate lung nodule segmentation, and has strong generalization ability in other accurate medical segmentation tasks with competitive results. Besides, we provide a new challenging lung nodules segmentation dataset for further studies (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NNkvDTb_0Ku0IoPsNMHezJR TH1Oi1wm/view?usp=sharing).
