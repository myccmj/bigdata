AB Nowadays, graph theory is one of the most exciting fields of mathematics due to the tremendous developments in modern technology, where it is used in many important applications. The orthogonal double cover (ODC) is a branch of graph theory and is considered as a special class of graph decomposition. In this paper, we decompose the complete bipartite graphs K-x,K-x by caterpillar graphs using the method of ODCs. The article also deals with constructing the ODCs of K-x,K-x by general symmetric starter vectors of caterpillar graphs such as stars-caterpillar, the disjoint copies of cycles-caterpillars, complete bipartite caterpillar graphs, and the disjoint copies of caterpillar paths. We decompose the complete bipartite graph by the complete bipartite subgraphs and by the disjoint copies of complete bipartite subgraphs using general symmetric starter vectors. The advantage of some of these new results is that they enable us to decompose the giant networks into large groups of small networks with the comprehensive coverage of all parts of the giant network by using the disjoint copies of symmetric starter subgraphs. The use case of applying the described theory for various applications is considered.

AB It is well known that ?-circulant matrices with ??0 can be simultaneously diagonalized by a transform matrix, which can be factored as the product of a diagonal matrix, depending on ?, and of the unitary matrix F-n associated to the Fast Fourier Transform. Hence, all the sets of ?-circulants form algebras whose computational power, in terms of complexity, is the same as the classical circulants with ?=1. However, stability is a delicate issue, since the condition number of the transform is equal to that of the diagonal part, tending to max{|?|,|?|(-1)}. For ?=0, the set of related matrices is still an algebra, which is the algebra of lower triangular matrices, but they do not admit a common transform since most of them (all except the multiples of the identity) are non-diagonalizable. In the present work, we review two modern applications, ranging from parallel computing in preconditioning of PDE approximations to algorithms for subdivision schemes, and we emphasize the role of such algebra. For the two problems, few numerical tests are conducted and critically discussed and the related conclusions are drawn.

ID MAXIMUM-ENTROPY
AB We present a novel nonparametric adaptive partitioning and stitching (NAPS) algorithm to estimate a probability density function (PDF) of a single variable. Sampled data is partitioned into blocks using a branching tree algorithm that minimizes deviations from a uniform density within blocks of various sample sizes arranged in a staggered format. The block sizes are constructed to balance the load in parallel computing as the PDF for each block is independently estimated using the nonparametric maximum entropy method (NMEM) previously developed for automated high throughput analysis. Once all block PDFs are calculated, they are stitched together to provide a smooth estimate throughout the sample range. Each stitch is an averaging process over weight factors based on the estimated cumulative distribution function (CDF) and a complementary CDF that characterize how data from flanking blocks overlap. Benchmarks on synthetic data show that our PDF estimates are fast and accurate for sample sizes ranging from 2(9) to 2(27), across a diverse set of distributions that account for single and multi-modal distributions with heavy tails or singularities. We also generate estimates by replacing NMEM with kernel density estimation (KDE) within blocks. Our results indicate that NAPS(NMEM) is the best-performing method overall, while NAPS(KDE) improves estimates near boundaries compared to standard KDE.

AB This paper proposes two algorithms for clustering data, which are variable-sized sets of elementary items. An example of such data occurs in the analysis of a medical diagnosis, where the goal is to detect human subjects who share common diseases to possibly predict future illnesses from previous medical history. The first proposed algorithm is based on K-medoids and the second algorithm extends the random swap algorithm, which has proven to be capable of efficient and careful clustering; both algorithms depend on a distance function among data objects (sets), which can use application-sensitive weights or priorities. The proposed distance function makes it possible to exploit several seeding methods that can improve clustering accuracy. A key factor in the two algorithms is their parallel implementation in Java, based on functional programming using streams and lambda expressions. The use of parallelism smooths out the O(N-2) computational cost behind K-medoids and clustering indexes such as the Silhouette index and allows for the handling of non-trivial datasets. This paper applies the algorithms to several benchmark case studies of sets and demonstrates how accurate and time-efficient clustering solutions can be achieved.

AB Neural networks have revolutionised the way we approach problem solving across multiple domains; however, their effective design and efficient use of computational resources is still a challenging task. One of the most important factors influencing this process is model hyperparameters which vary significantly with models and datasets. Recently, there has been an increased focus on automatically tuning these hyperparameters to reduce complexity and to optimise resource utilisation. From traditional human-intuitive tuning methods to random search, grid search, Bayesian optimisation, and evolutionary algorithms, significant advancements have been made in this direction that promise improved performance while using fewer resources. In this article, we propose HyperGE, a two-stage model for automatically tuning hyperparameters driven by grammatical evolution (GE), a bioinspired population-based machine learning algorithm. GE provides an advantage in that it allows users to define their own grammar for generating solutions, making it ideal for defining search spaces across datasets and models. We test HyperGE to fine-tune VGG-19 and ResNet-50 pre-trained networks using three benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that the search space is significantly reduced by a factor of similar to 90% in Stage 2 with fewer number of trials. HyperGE could become an invaluable tool within the deep learning community, allowing practitioners greater freedom when exploring complex problem domains for hyperparameter fine-tuning.

AB Rapid and accurate tree-crown detection is significant to forestry management and precision forestry. In the past few decades, the development and maturity of remote sensing technology has created more convenience for tree-crown detection and planting management. However, the variability of the data source leads to significant differences between feature distributions, bringing great challenges for traditional deep-learning-based methods on cross-regional detection. Moreover, compared with other tasks, tree-crown detection has the problems of a poor abundance of objects, an overwhelming number of easy samples and the existence of a quantity of impervious background similar to the tree crown, which make it difficult for the classifier to learn discriminative features. To solve these problems, we apply domain adaptation (DA) to tree-crown detection and propose a DA cascade tree-crown detection framework with multiple region proposal networks, dubbed CAS-DA, realizing cross-regional tree-crown detection and counting from multiple-source remote sensing images. The essence of the multiple region proposal networks in CAS-DA is obtaining the multilevel features and enhancing deeper label classifiers gradually by filtering simple samples of source domain at an early stage. Then, the cascade structure is integrated with a DA object detector and the end-to-end training is realized through the proposed cascade loss function. Moreover, a filtering strategy based on the planting rules of tree crowns is designed and applied to filter wrongly detected trees by CAS-DA. We verify the effectiveness of our method in two different domain shift scenarios, including adaptation between satellite and drone images and cross-satellite adaptation. The results show that, compared to the existing DA methods, our method achieves the best average F1-score in all adaptions. It is also found that the performance between satellite and drone images is significantly worse than that between different satellite images, with average F1-scores of 68.95% and 88.83%, respectively. Nevertheless, there is an improvement of 11.88%similar to 40.00% in the former, which is greater than 0.50%similar to 5.02% in the latter. The above results prove that in tree-crown detection, it is more effective for the DA detector to improve the detection performance on the source domain than to diminish the domain shift alone, especially when a large domain shift exists.

AB Extracting k-order maximal-sum principal submatrix from an n-order real matrix is a typical combinatorial optimization problem and an NP-hard problem. To improve the computational efficiency of solving this problem, we, in this paper, propose an accelerated algorithm with row-by-row updates, called the fusion row update accelerated algorithm, which works by reducing the number of addition operations for submatrix elements. The new algorithm is applied to accelerate color combination selection and maximize color difference, which improves the readability of data visualization results; it is also applied to accelerate stock investment portfolio selection and minimize correlation degree, which decreases the investment risk in the view of daily return volatility.

ID NEURAL NETWORKS
AB This paper introduces methods for parallelizing the algorithm to enhance the efficiency of event recovery in Spin Physics Detector (SPD) experiments at the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider Facility (NICA). The problem of eliminating false tracks during the particle trajectory detection process remains a crucial challenge in overcoming performance bottlenecks in processing collider data generated in high volumes and at a fast pace. In this paper, we propose and show fast parallel false track elimination methods based on the introduced criterion of a clustering-based thresholding approach with a chi-squared quality-of-fit metric. The proposed strategy achieves a good trade-off between the effectiveness of track reconstruction and the pace of execution on today's advanced multicore computers. To facilitate this, a quality benchmark for reconstruction is established, using the root mean square (rms) error of spiral and polynomial fitting for the datasets identified as the subsequent track candidate by the neural network. Choosing the right benchmark enables us to maintain the recall and precision indicators of the neural network track recognition performance at a level that is satisfactory to physicists, even though these metrics will inevitably decline as the data noise increases. Moreover, it has been possible to improve the processing speed of the complete program pipeline by 6 times through parallelization of the algorithm, achieving a rate of 2000 events per second, even when handling extremely noisy input data.

AB In this paper, the possibilities of expressing the natural response of a linear commensurate fractional-order system (FOS) as a linear combination of basis functions are analyzed. For all possible types of s(& alpha;)-domain poles, the corresponding basis functions are found, the kernel of which is the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function E-& alpha;(,& beta;), & beta; = & alpha;. It is pointed out that there are mutually unambiguous correspondences between the basis functions of FOS and the known basis functions of the integer-order system (IOS) for & alpha; = 1. This correspondence can be used to algorithmically find analytical formulas for the impulse responses of FOS when the formulas for the characteristics of IOS are known. It is shown that all basis functions of FOS can be generated with Podlubny's function of type & epsilon;(k) (t, c; & alpha;, & alpha;), where c and k are the corresponding pole and its multiplicity, respectively.

AB A new algorithm is presented to compute nonrigid, possibly partial comparisons of shapes defined by unstructured triangulations of their surfaces. The algorithm takes as input a pair of surfaces with each surface given by a distinct and unrelated triangulation. Its goal is to define a possibly partial correspondence between the vertices of the two triangulations, with a cost associated with this correspondence that can serve as a measure of the similarity of the two shapes. To find this correspondence, the vertices in each triangulation are characterized by a signature vector of features. We tested both the LD-SIFT signatures, based on the concept of spin images, and the wave kernel signatures obtained by solving the Shrodinger equation on the triangulation. A cost matrix C is constructed such that C(k,l) is the norm of the difference of the signature vectors of vertices k and l. The correspondence between the triangulations is then computed as the transport plan that solves the optimal transport or optimal partial transport problem between their sets of vertices. We use a statistical physics approach to solve these problems. The presentation of the proposed algorithm is complemented with examples that illustrate its effectiveness and manageable computing cost.

TI A Corrosion Maintenance Model Using Continuous State Partially

SO ALGORITHMS
LA English
DT Article
DE maintenance; oil and gas pipeline; partially observable Markov decision

AB This paper proposes a continuous state partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for the corrosion maintenance of oil and gas pipelines. The maintenance operations include complex and extensive activities to detect the corrosion type, determine its severity, predict the deterioration rate, and plan future inspection (monitoring) schemes and maintenance policy. A POMDP model is formulated as a decision-making support tool to effectively handle partially observed corrosion defect levels. It formulates states as the pipeline's degradation level using a probability distribution. Inline inspection (ILI) methods estimate the latest state of the pipeline, which also defines the initial state of the optimization process. The set of actions comprises corrosion mitigation operations. The errors associated with the ILI method are used to construct the observation function for the model. The sum of inspection, maintenance operations, and failure costs for a given state and action are formulated as rewards. Numerical experiments are made based on data collected from the literature. The results showed that different policies, whether derived from solvers (theoretical) or determined from practical experience, can be compared to identify the best maintenance alternative using the model. It was also observed that the choice of the solvers is important since they affect the discounted rewards and the run time to obtain them. The model approximates the parameters and uncertainty associated with the propagation of corrosion, proficiency of inspection methods, and implementation of maintenance policies. Overall, it can be applied to improve the maintenance decision-making process for the oil and gas pipeline as it incorporates the stochastic features of the operation.

TI CLDM: convolutional layer dropout module
SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE CNN; Regularization method; Structural dropout; Variance
AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are prone to overfitting due to their overparameterization. Structural dropout methods such as weighted channel dropout alleviate this problem by dropping continuous regions based on the importance degrees computed from the average activation values of each channel in the feature map. However, there is insufficient evidence supporting the mean value as a representative evaluation method of importance degree. Additionally, the importance degree of a channel may also be related to kernel information. To better represent the importance degree of channels, this work proposes using the variance instead of the mean as the importance evaluation method of regions in structural dropout methods and proposes a convolutional layer dropout module (CLDM), which utilizes the variance values of both the kernel and feature map to determine the regions that can be dropped. CLDM is a parameter-free plug-and-play module used for regularizing various deep CNNs without any additional computational cost during the test phase. Extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed CLDM outperforms other state-of-the-art structural dropout methods and proves the effectiveness of the variance evaluation method and the benefit of introducing kernel information in the dropout process, respectively.

AB While Industrial Augmented Reality (IAR) has many applications across the whole product lifecycle, most IAR applications today are custom-built for specific use-cases in practice. This contribution builds upon a scoping literature review of IAR data representations to present a modern, modular IAR architecture. The individual modules of the presented approach are either responsible for user interface and user interaction or for data processing. They are use-case neutral and independent of each other, while communicating through a strictly separated application layer. To demonstrate the architecture, this contribution presents an assembly process that is supported once with a pick-to-light system and once using in situ projections. Both are implemented on top of the novel architecture, allowing most of the work on the individual models to be reused. This IAR architecture, based on clearly separated modules with defined interfaces, particularly allows small companies with limited personnel resources to adapt IAR for their specific use-cases more easily than developing single-use applications from scratch.

ID VISUAL IMPAIRMENT
AB To create a truly accessible and inclusive society, we need to take the more than 2.2 billion people with vision impairments worldwide into account when we design our cities, buildings, and everyday objects. This requires sympathy and empathy, as well as a certain level of understanding of the impact of vision impairments on perception. In this study, we explore the potential of an extended version of our vision-impairment simulation system XREye to increase sympathy and empathy and evaluate its educational value in an expert study with 56 educators and education students. We include data from a previous study in related work on sympathy and empathy as a baseline for comparison with our data. Our results show increased sympathy and empathy after experiencing XREye and positive feedback regarding its educational value. Hence, we believe that vision-impairment simulations, such as XREye, have merit to be used for educational purposes in order to increase awareness for the challenges people with vision impairments face in their everyday lives.

AB The paper presents an existing scenario related to the advanced integration of digital technologies in the field of house museums, based on the critical literature and applied experimentation. House museums are a particular type of heritage site, in which is highlighted the tension between the evocative capacity of the spaces and the requirements for preservation. In this dimension, the use of a seamless approach amplifies the atmospheric component of the space, superimposing, through hybrid digital technologies, an interactive, context-driven layer in an open dialogue between digital and physical. The methodology moves on the one hand from the literature review, framing the macro themes of research, and on the other from the overview of case studies, selected on the basis of the experiential value of the space. The analysis of the selected cases followed as criteria: the formal dimension of the technology; the narrative plot, as storytelling of socio-cultural atmosphere or identification within the intimate story; and the involvement of visitors as individual immersion or collective rituality. The paper aimed at outlining a developmental panorama in which the integration of hybrid technologies points to a new seamless awareness within application scenarios as continuous and work-in-progress challenges.

In this work, we investigated learning curves in acupuncture needle manipulation training with continuous performance measurement using a vision-based needle training system. We tracked the needle insertion depth of 10 students to investigate their learning curves. The results show that the group-level learning curve was fitted with the Thurstone curve, indicating that students were able to improve their needle insertion skills after repeated practice. Additionally, the analysis of individual learning curves revealed valuable insights into the learning experiences of each participant, highlighting the importance of considering individual differences in learning styles and abilities when designing training programs.

AB Projected walk-through fogscreens have been created, but there is little research on the evaluation of the interaction performance with fogscreens. The present study investigated mid-air hand gestures for interaction with a large fogscreen. Participants (N = 20) selected objects from a fogscreen using tapping and dwell-based gestural techniques, with and without vibrotactile/haptic feedback. In terms of Fitts' law, the throughput was about 1.4 bps to 2.6 bps, suggesting that gestural interaction with a large fogscreen is a suitable and effective input method. Our results also suggest that tapping without haptic feedback has good performance and potential for interaction with a fogscreen, and that tactile feedback is not necessary for effective mid-air interaction. These findings have implications for the design of gestural interfaces suitable for interaction with fogscreens.

Consequently, assessing the learning attitudes of students toward mobile learning is crucial, as learning attitudes impact their motivation, performance, and beliefs about mobile learning. However, mobile learning seems under-researched and may require additional efforts from researchers, especially in the context of the Middle East. Hence, this study's contribution is enhancing our knowledge about students' attitudes towards mobile-based learning. Therefore, the study goal was to investigate m-learning's effect on the learning attitudes among technology education students. An explanatory sequential mixed approach was utilized to examine the attitudes of 50 students who took an educational technology class. A quasi-experiment was conducted and a phenomenological approach was adopted. Data from the experimental group and the control group were gathered. Focus group discussions with three groups and 25 semi-structured interviews were performed with students who experienced m-learning in their course. ANCOVA was conducted and revealed the impact of m-learning on the attitudes and their components. An inductive and deductive content analysis was conducted. Eleven subthemes stemmed out of three main themes. These subthemes included: personalized learning, visualization of learning motivation, less learning frustration, enhancing participation, learning on familiar devices, and social interaction, which emerged from the data. The researchers recommended that higher education institutions adhere to a set of guiding principles when creating m-learning policies. Additionally, they should customize the m-learning environment with higher levels of interactivity to meet students' needs and learning styles to improve their attitudes towards m-learning.

AB Quantum many-body control is a central milestone en route to harnessing quantum technologies. However, the exponential growth of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of qubits makes it challenging to classically simulate quantum many-body systems and, consequently, to devise reliable and robust optimal control protocols. Here we present a framework for efficiently controlling quantum many-body systems based on reinforcement learning (RL). We tackle the quantum-control problem by leveraging matrix product states (1) for representing the many-body state and (2) as part of the trainable machine learning architecture for our RL agent. The framework is applied to prepare ground states of the quantum Ising chain, including states in the critical region. It allows us to control systems far larger than neural-network-only architectures permit, while retaining the advantages of deep learning algorithms, such as generalizability and trainable robustness to noise. In particular, we demonstrate that RL agents are capable of finding universal controls, of learning how to optimally steer previously unseen many-body states and of adapting control protocols on the fly when the quantum dynamics is subject to stochastic perturbations. Furthermore, we map our RL framework to a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that can be performed on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and test it under the presence of experimentally relevant sources of noise.
   Optimal control of quantum many-body systems is needed to make use of quantum technologies, but is challenging due to the exponentially large dimension of the Hilbert space as a function of the number of qubits. Metz and Bukov propose a framework combining matrix product states and reinforcement learning that allows control of a larger number of interacting quantum particles than achievable with standard neural-network-based methods.

AB As a critical factor in ensuring the growth of the electronic auction (e-auction) domain, the privacy and security of the participants (sellers and buyers) must always be guaranteed. Traditionally, auction data, including participant details, are stored in a third party (auctioneer) database. This leads to a high risk of a single point of failure in terms of privacy and security. Toward this end, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising decentralized communication paradigm to address such risks. This paper presents a blockchain-based auction framework as a decentralized e-auctioning framework for location-aware services. In particular, the framework consists of three components: pre-auctioning, main auctioning, and post-auctioning processes with four algorithms. Our primary focus is on location-aware services, such as storage space rental, apartment rental, transport hire, and parking space rental. The trading volumes are expected to be high; hence, simplifying the design is a crucial requirement. In addition to the benefits of eliminating the centralized entity (the auctioneer), fees are redistributed among participants as rewards. Further, we incorporate a service quality monitoring method that ranks the services provided by participants. This ranking allows participants to determine the rank of other participants with whom they wish to trade. We have conducted several experiments to evaluate the proposed framework's cost feasibility and to ensure the ease of the business flow.

AB Algorithms optimized for high-performance computing, which ensure both speed and accuracy, are crucial for real-time data analysis in heavy-ion physics experiments. The application of neural networks and other machine learning methodologies, which are fast and have high accuracy, in physics experiments has become increasingly popular over recent years. This paper introduces a fast neural network package named ANN4FLES developed in C++, which has been optimized for use on a high-performance computing cluster for the future Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany). The use of neural networks for classifying events during heavy-ion collisions in the CBM experiment is under investigation. This paper provides a detailed description of the application of ANN4FLES in identifying collisions where a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) was produced. The methodology detailed here will be used in the development of a QGP trigger for event selection within the First Level Event Selection (FLES) package for the CBM experiment. Fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have been created for the identification of events containing QGP, which are simulated with the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) microscopic off-shell transport approach, for central Au + Au collisions at an energy of 31.2 A GeV. The results show that the convolutional neural network outperforms the fully-connected networks and achieves over 95% accuracy on the testing dataset.

ID REBALANCING PROBLEM; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; DEMAND
AB In bike-sharing systems, the inventory level is defined as the daily number of bicycles required to optimally meet the demand. Estimating these values is a major challenge for bike-sharing operators, as biased inventory levels lead to a reduced quality of service at best and a loss of customers and system failure at worst. This paper focuses on using machine learning (ML) classifiers, most notably random forest and gradient tree boosting, for estimating the inventory level from available features including historical data. However, while similar approaches adopted in the context of bike sharing assume the data to be well-balanced, this assumption is not met in the case of the inventory problem. Indeed, as the demand for bike sharing is sparse, datasets become biased toward low demand values, and systematic errors emerge. Thus, we propose to include a new iterative resampling procedure in the classification problem to deal with imbalanced datasets. The proposed model, tested on the real-world data of the Citi Bike operator in New York, allows to (i) provide upper-bound and lower-bound values for the bike-sharing inventory problem, accurately predicting both predominant and rare demand values; (ii) capture the main features that characterize the different demand classes; and (iii) work in a day-to-day framework. Finally, successful bike-sharing systems grow rapidly, opening new stations every year. In addition to changes in the mobility demand, an additional problem is that we cannot use historical information to predict inventory levels for new stations. Therefore, we test the capability of our model to predict inventory levels when historical data is not available, with a specific focus on stations that were not available for training.

AB Being able to infer the clonal evolution and progression of cancer makes it possible to devise targeted therapies to treat the disease. As discussed in several studies, understanding the history of accumulation and the evolution of mutations during cancer progression is of key importance when devising treatment strategies. Given the importance of the task, many methods for phylogeny reconstructions have been developed over the years, mostly employing probabilistic frameworks. Our goal was to explore different methods to take on this phylogeny inference problem; therefore, we devised and implemented three different metaheuristic approaches-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Programming (GP) and Variable Neighbourhood Search (VNS)-under the Perfect Phylogeny and the Dollo-k evolutionary models. We adapted the algorithms to be applied to this specific context, specifically to a tree-based search space, and proposed six different experimental settings, in increasing order of difficulty, to test the novel methods amongst themselves and against a state-of-the-art method. Of the three, the PSO shows particularly promising results and is comparable to published tools, even at this exploratory stage. Thus, we foresee great improvements if alternative definitions of distance and velocity in a tree space, capable of better handling such non-Euclidean search spaces, are devised in future works.

AB In control research and design it is frequently necessary to explore, evaluate, tune and compare many control strategies. These activities are assisted by software tools of increasing complexity; however, even with the existing high performance tools these activities are very time consuming due to they imply hundred if not thousand of simulations. If the process of doing such simulations is not automated it can be a very time consuming task. There has been proposed evolutionary algorithms (EA) that in the search for an optimal control automatically generate many control structures. However, the space of possible controllers for any dynamical system is huge. Hence it is mandatory to restrict the search space. The best way to restrict the controller search space is to let the designer influence the search direction. In this paper we propose a software tool for control research that has as its main part an EA that produce only controllers having a pre-specified morphology. By specifying a controller morphology the designer can influence the search direction without losing the exploration capability of evolutionary algorithms. The EA is endowed with a cost function tailored for fast evaluation of closed-loop controller performance. The use of the tool is illustrated by searching an sliding mode and similar controllers for an unstable linear and two nonlinear systems.

AB Classifying digital images using neural networks is one of the most fundamental tasks within the field of artificial intelligence. For a long time, convolutional neural networks have proven to be the most efficient solution for processing visual data, such as classification, detection, or segmentation. The efficient operation of convolutional neural networks requires the use of data augmentation and a high number of feature maps to embed object transformations. Especially for large datasets, this approach is not very efficient. In 2017, Geoffrey Hinton and his research team introduced the theory of capsule networks. Capsule networks offer a solution to the problems of convolutional neural networks. In this approach, sufficient efficiency can be achieved without large-scale data augmentation. However, the training time for Hinton's capsule network is much longer than for convolutional neural networks. We have examined the capsule networks and propose a modification in the routing mechanism to speed up the algorithm. This could reduce the training time of capsule networks by almost half in some cases. Moreover, our solution achieves performance improvements in the field of image classification.

AB The identification of biomarkers is crucial for cancer diagnosis, understanding the underlying biological mechanisms, and developing targeted therapies. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach to predict ovarian cancer patients' outcomes and platinum resistance status using publicly available gene expression data. Six classical machine-learning algorithms are compared on their predictive performance. Those with the highest score are analyzed by their feature importance using the SHAP algorithm. We were able to select multiple genes that correlated with the outcome and platinum resistance status of the patients and validated those using Kaplan-Meier plots. In comparison to similar approaches, the performance of the models was higher, and different genes using feature importance analysis were identified. The most promising identified genes that could be used as biomarkers are TMEFF2, ACSM3, SLC4A1, and ALDH4A1.

AB In contemporary wireless communication networks, base stations are organized into coordinated clusters (called cells) to jointly serve the users. However, such fixed systems are plagued by the so-called cell-edge problem: near the boundaries, the interference between neighboring clusters can result in very poor interference-to-signal power ratios. To achieve a high-quality service, it is an important objective to minimize the sum of these ratios over the cells. The most common approach to solving this minimization problem is arguably the spectral clustering method. In this paper, we propose a new clustering approach, which is deterministic and computationally much less demanding than current methods. Simulating on synthetic instances indicates that our methods typically provide higher quality solutions than earlier methods.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a non-parametric adaptive technique used for time series analysis. It allows solving various problems related to time series without the need to define a model. In this study, we focus on the problem of trend extraction. To extract trends using SSA, a grouping of elementary components is required. However, automating this process is challenging due to the nonparametric nature of SSA. Although there are some known approaches to automated grouping in SSA, they do not work well when the signal components are mixed. In this paper, a novel approach that combines automated identification of trend components with separability improvement is proposed. We also consider a new method called EOSSA for separability improvement, along with other known methods. The automated modifications are numerically compared and applied to real-life time series. The proposed approach demonstrated its advantage in extracting trends when dealing with mixed signal components. The separability-improving method EOSSA proved to be the most accurate when the signal rank is properly detected or slightly exceeded. The automated SSA was very successfully applied to US Unemployment data to separate an annual trend from seasonal effects. The proposed approach has shown its capability to automatically extract trends without the need to determine their parametric form.

ID TIME-SERIES REPRESENTATION; SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION
AB Time series data typically exhibit high dimensionality and complexity, necessitating the use of specific approximation methods to perform computations on the data. The currently employed compression methods suffer from varying degrees of feature loss, leading to potential distortions in similarity measurement results. Considering the aforementioned challenges and concerns, this paper proposes a double mean representation method, SAX-DM (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation Based on Double Mean Representation), for time series data, along with a similarity measurement approach based on SAX-DM. Addressing the trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy in the improved SAX representation, SAX-DM utilizes the segment mean and the segment trend distance to represent corresponding segments of time series data. This method reduces the dimensionality of the original sequences while preserving the original features and trend information of the time series data, resulting in a unified representation of time series segments. Experimental results demonstrate that, under the same compression ratio, SAX-DM combined with its similarity measurement method achieves higher expression accuracy, balanced compression rate, and accuracy, compared to SAX-TD and SAX-BD, in over 80% of the UCR Time Series dataset. This approach improves the efficiency and precision of similarity calculation.

AB The objective is to find a Cellular Automata (CA) rule that can generate "loop patterns". A loop pattern is given by ones on a zero background showing loops. In order to find out how loop patterns can be locally defined, tentative loop patterns are generated by a genetic algorithm in a preliminary stage. A set of local matching tiles is designed and checked whether they can produce the aimed loop patterns by the genetic algorithm. After having approved a certain set of tiles, a probabilistic CA rule is designed in a methodical way. Templates are derived from the tiles, which then are used in the CA rule for matching. In order to drive the evolution to the desired patterns, noise is injected if the templates do not match or other constraints are not fulfilled. Simulations illustrate that loops and connected loops can be evolved by the CA rule.

AB Agent-based model (ABM) development needs information on system components and interactions. Qualitative narratives contain contextually rich system information beneficial for ABM conceptualization. Traditional qualitative data extraction is manual, complex, and time- and resource-consuming. Moreover, manual data extraction is often biased and may produce questionable and unreliable models. A possible alternative is to employ automated approaches borrowed from Artificial Intelligence. This study presents a largely unsupervised qualitative data extraction framework for ABM development. Using semantic and syntactic Natural Language Processing tools, our methodology extracts information on system agents, their attributes, and actions and interactions. In addition to expediting information extraction for ABM, the largely unsupervised approach also minimizes biases arising from modelers' preconceptions about target systems. We also introduce automatic and manual noise-reduction stages to make the framework usable on large semi-structured datasets. We demonstrate the approach by developing a conceptual ABM of household food security in rural Mali. The data for the model contain a large set of semi-structured qualitative field interviews. The data extraction is swift, predominantly automatic, and devoid of human manipulation. We contextualize the model manually using the extracted information. We also put the conceptual model to stakeholder evaluation for added credibility and validity.

AB The rapid development of speech synthesis technology has significantly improved the naturalness and human-likeness of synthetic speech. As the technical barriers for speech synthesis are rapidly lowering, the number of illegal activities such as fraud and extortion is increasing, posing a significant threat to authentication systems, such as automatic speaker verification. This paper proposes an end-to-end speech synthesis detection model based on audio feature fusion in response to the constantly evolving synthesis techniques and to improve the accuracy of detecting synthetic speech. The model uses a pre-trained wav2vec2 model to extract features from raw waveforms and utilizes an audio feature fusion module for back-end classification. The audio feature fusion module aims to improve the model accuracy by adequately utilizing the audio features extracted from the front end and fusing the information from timeframes and feature dimensions. Data augmentation techniques are also used to enhance the performance generalization of the model. The model is trained on the training and development sets of the logical access (LA) dataset of the ASVspoof 2019 Challenge, an international standard, and is tested on the logical access (LA) and deep-fake (DF) evaluation datasets of the ASVspoof 2021 Challenge. The equal error rate (EER) on ASVspoof 2021 LA and ASVspoof 2021 DF are 1.18% and 2.62%, respectively, achieving the best results on the DF dataset.

AB Due to the widespread distribution of coronavirus and the existence of a massive quantity of data on social networking sites, particularly Twitter, there was an urgent need to develop a model that evaluates users' emotions and determines how they feel about the pandemic. However, the absence of resources to assist Sentiment Analysis (SA) in Arabic hampered the completion of this endeavor. This work presents the ArSentiCOVID lexicon, the first and largest Arabic SA lexicon for COVID-19 that handles negation and emojis. We design a lexicon-based sentiment analyzer tool that depends mainly on the ArSentiCOVID lexicon to perform a three-way classification. Furthermore, we employ the sentiment analyzer to automatically assemble 42K annotated Arabic tweets for COVID-19. We conduct two experiments. First, we test the effect of applying negation and emoji rules to the created lexicon. The results indicate that after applying the emoji, negation, and both rules, the F-score improved by 2.13%, 4.13%, and 6.13%, respectively. Second, we applied an ensemble method that combines four feature groups (n-grams, negation, polarity, and emojis) as input features for eight Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. The results reveal that Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers work best, and that the four feature groups combined are best for representing features produced the maximum accuracy of (92.21%), precision (92.23%), recall (92.21%), and F-score (92.23%) with 3.2% improvement over the base model.

AB The hybrid model for analyzing distortions of a laser beam passed through a moderately scattering medium with the number of scattering events up to 10 is developed and investigated. The model implemented the Monte Carlo technique to simulate the beam propagation through a scattering layer, a ray-tracing technique to propagate the scattered beam to the measurements plane, and the Shack-Hartmann technique to calculate the scattered laser beam distortions. The results obtained from the developed model were confirmed during the laboratory experiment. Both the numerical model and laboratory experiment showed that with an increase of the concentration value of scattering particles in the range from 10(5) to 10(6) mm(-3), the amplitude of distortions of laser beam propagated through the layer of the scattering medium increases exponentially.

AB Practical entanglement distillation is a critical component in quantum information theory. Entanglement distillation is often utilized for designing quantum computer networks and quantum repeaters. The practical entanglement distillation problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. A fuzzy formulation is introduced to estimate the quantum state (density matrix) from pseudo-likelihood functions (i.e., quantum state tomography). A scale-independent relationship between fuzzy relations in terms of the pseudo-likelihood functions is obtained. The entanglement distillation optimization problem is solved using the combined coupled map lattice and dual annealing approach. Comparative analysis of the results is then conducted against a standard dual annealing algorithmic implementation.

AB The rapid development of technology has led to the implementation of data-driven systems whose performance heavily relies on the amount and type of data. In the latest decades, in the field of bioengineering data management, among others, eye-tracking data have become one of the most interesting and essential components for many medical, psychological, and engineering research applications. However, despite the large usage of eye-tracking data in many studies and applications, a strong gap is still present in the literature regarding real-time data collection and management, which leads to strong constraints for the reliability and accuracy of on-time results. To address this gap, this study aims to introduce a system that enables the collection, processing, real-time streaming, and storage of eye-tracking data. The system was developed using the Java programming language, WebSocket protocol, and Representational State Transfer (REST), improving the efficiency in transferring and managing eye-tracking data. The results were computed in two test conditions, i.e., local and online scenarios, within a time window of 100 seconds. The experiments conducted for this study were carried out by comparing the time delay between two different scenarios, even if preliminary results showed a significantly improved performance of data management systems in managing real-time data transfer. Overall, this system can significantly benefit the research community by providing real-time data transfer and storing the data, enabling more extensive studies using eye-tracking data.

AB Selecting the appropriate temporary facilities is important for reducing cost and improving the productivity and safety of craft professionals in construction projects. However, the manual planning process for scaffolding systems is typically prone to inefficiencies. This paper aims to develop a knowledge-based framework for a scaffolding decision support system for industry. An integrated two-phase system was established, including a technical evaluation module and a knowledge-based module. First, the system identifies feasible scaffolding alternatives from the database through a rule-based algorithm. Second, a knowledge-based module was designed to assess the alternative performance. The framework effectively generated the ranking of scaffolding alternatives, and the top three influential factors were identified, including the site accessibility, protection to workers and health risk. Thus, an application study of an industrial steel project was proffered to validate the effectiveness of the framework. The proposed framework may help decision-making regarding the implementation of temporary facility planning in industry practices. It has wider applicability because it simultaneously considers site conditions, productivity, safety, and financial benefits, and is designed and implemented through a computerized path. The paper contributes to the industry by developing an integrated decision support system for temporary facilities. Additionally, the practical contribution of this research is the provision of an optimized scaffolding planning method that could be utilized as a guide when implementing the decision support system.

AB This work focuses on the methods of creating in-fiber devices, such as sensors, filters, and scatterers, using the fiber fuse effect. The effect allows for the creation of structures in a fiber core. However, it is necessary to know exactly how this process works, when the plasma spark occurs, what size it reaches, and how it depends on external parameters such as power and wavelength of radiation. Thus, this present study aims to create the possibility of predicting the consequences of optical breakdown. This paper describes a mathematical model of the optical breakdown initiation in a fiber core based on the thermal conductivity equation. The breakdown generates a plasma spark, which subsequently moves along the fiber. The problem is solved in the axisymmetric formulation. The computational domain consists of four elements with different thermophysical properties at the boundaries of which conjugation conditions are fulfilled. The term describing the heat source in the model is determined by the wavelength of radiation and the refractive indices of the core and the shell and also includes the radiation absorption on the released electrons during the thermal ionization of the quartz glass. The temperature field distributions in the optical fiber are obtained. Based on the calculations, it is possible to estimate the occurrence times of various phase states inside the fiber, in particular, the plasma spark occurrence time.

ID PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE; SYSTEM; POLICY; COST
AB Wind power is one of the most important sources of renewable energy available today. A large part of the cost of wind energy is due to the cost of maintaining wind power equipment. When a wind turbine component fails to function, it might need to be replaced under circumstances that are less than ideal. This is known as corrective maintenance. To minimize unnecessary costs, a more active maintenance policy based on the life expectancy of the key components is preferred. Optimal scheduling of preventive maintenance activities requires advanced mathematical modeling. In this paper, an optimal preventive maintenance algorithm is designed using the renewal-reward theorem. In the multi-component setting, our approach involves a new idea of virtual maintenance that allows us to treat each replacement event as a renewal event even if some components are not replaced by new ones. The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to a four-component model of a wind turbine, and the optimal maintenance plans are computed for various initial conditions. The modeling results clearly show the benefit of PM planning compared to a pure CM strategy (about 30% lower maintenance cost).

AB Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been used extensively in numerical and engineering optimization problems in the last decades. However, due to drawbacks such as a single learning sample, PSO has the problems of loss of population diversity and easily falls into local optimum. To enhance optimization capability, a PSO based on fuzzy logic and hierarchical learning mechanism (FHPSO) is proposed. In FHPSO, the parameters are dynamically adjusted through fuzzy logic. The purpose of the fuzzy system is to generate appropriate parameters based on the performance metrics at each iteration, which better balances exploration and exploitation capability. Then particles are classified into different layers in terms of their fitness, and the particles in different layers perform different learning mechanisms. Each layer divides the particles into high-energy particles and low-energy particles. The high-energy particles in each layer are qualified to learn from the particles in the upper layer and the low-energy particles learn from the high-energy particles in their layer. This learning mechanism avoids all individuals to learn the global optimal individual at each iteration which will effectively reduce the speed and possibility of premature convergence and maintain population diversity. The FHPSO was compared with 8 well-known algorithms and 6 state-of-the-art PSO variants in the CEC 2022 and CEC 2021 test suites, respectively. The experimental results show significant performance of FHPSO. Simulation results for 5 complex engineering optimization problems and 3D path planning problem also show that the FHPSO can provides more competitive optimization results.

AB This paper introduces a novel algorithm for designing a low-pass filter (LPF) and a microstrip Wilkinson power divider (WPD) using a neural network surrogate model. The proposed algorithm is applicable to various microwave devices, enhancing their performance and frequency response. Desirable output parameters can be achieved for the designed LPF and WPD by using the proposed algorithm. The proposed artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model is employed to calculate the dimensions of the LPF and WPD, resulting in their efficient design. The LPF and WPD designs incorporate open stubs, stepped impedances, triangular-shaped resonators, and meandered lines to achieve optimal performance. The compact LPF occupies a size of only 0.15 & lambda;g x 0.081 & lambda;g, and exhibits a sharp response within the transmission band, with a sharpness parameter of approximately 185 dB/GHz. The designed WPD, operating at 1.5 GHz, exhibits outstanding harmonics suppression from 2 GHz to 20 GHz, with attenuation levels exceeding 20 dB. The WPD successfully suppresses 12 unwanted harmonics (2nd to 13th). The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed design algorithm effectively accomplishes the LPF and WPD designs, exhibiting desirable parameters such as operating frequency and high-frequency harmonics suppression. The WPD demonstrates a low insertion loss of 0.1 dB (S-21 = 0.1 dB), input and output return losses exceeding 30 dB (S-11 = -35 dB, S-22 = -30 dB), and an output ports isolation of more than 32 dB (S-23 = -32 dB), making it suitable for integration into modern communication systems.

AB Crude oil resource scheduling is one of the critical issues upstream in the crude oil industry chain. It aims to reduce transportation and inventory costs and avoid alerts of inventory limit violations by formulating reasonable crude oil transportation and inventory strategies. Two main difficulties coexist in this problem: the large problem scale and uncertain supply and demand. Traditional operations research (OR) methods, which rely on forecasting supply and demand, face significant challenges when applied to the complicated and uncertain short-term operational process of the crude oil supply chain. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hierarchical optimization framework and proposes a well-designed hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) algorithm. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL), as an upper-level agent, is used to select the operational operators combined by various sub-goals and solving orders, while the lower-level agent finds a viable solution and provides penalty feedback to the upper-level agent based on the chosen operator. Additionally, we deploy a simulator based on real-world data and execute comprehensive experiments. Regarding the alert number, maximum alert penalty, and overall transportation cost, our HRL method outperforms existing OR and two RL algorithms in the majority of time steps.

AB In this work, we have applied physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for solving mesh deformation problems. We used the collocation PINN method to capture the new positions of the vertex nodes while preserving the connectivity information. We use linear elasticity equations for mesh deformation. To prevent vertex collisions or edge overlap, the mesh movement in this work is conducted in steps with relatively small movements. For moving boundary problems, the exact position of the boundary is essential for having an accurate solution. However, PINNs are frequently unable to satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions exactly. To overcome this issue, we have used hard boundary condition enforcement to automatically satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions. Specifically, we first trained a PINN with soft boundary conditions to obtain a particular solution. Then, this solution was tuned with exact boundary positions and a proper distance function by using a new PINN considering only the equation residual. To assess the accuracy of our approach, we used the classical translation and rotation tests and compared them with a proper mesh quality metric considering the change in the element area and shape. The results show the accuracy of this approach is comparable with that of finite element solutions. We also solved different moving boundary problems, resembling commonly used fluid-structure interaction problems. This work provides insight into using PINN for mesh-deformation problems without needing a discretization scheme with reasonable accuracy.

AB Due to the presence of redundant and irrelevant features in large-dimensional biomedical datasets, the prediction accuracy of disease diagnosis can often be decreased. Therefore, it is important to adopt feature extraction methodologies that can deal with problem structures and identify underlying data patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the Anti Coronavirus Optimized Kernel-based Softplus Extreme Learning Machine (ACO-KSELM) to accurately predict different types of skin cancer by analyzing high-dimensional datasets. To evaluate the proposed ACO-KSELM method, we used four different skin cancer image datasets: ISIC 2016, ACS, HAM10000, and PAD-UFES-20. These dermoscopic image datasets were preprocessed using Gaussian filters to remove noise and artifacts, and relevant features based on color, texture, and shape were extracted using color histogram, Haralick texture, and Hu moment extraction approaches, respectively. Finally, the proposed ACOKSELM method accurately predicted and classified the extracted features into Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC), Actinic Keratosis (ACK), Seborrheic Keratosis (SEK), Bowen's disease (BOD), Melanoma (MEL), and Nevus (NEV) categories. The analytical results showed that the proposed method achieved a higher rate of prediction accuracy of about 98.9%, 98.7%, 98.6%, and 97.9% for the ISIC 2016, ACS, HAM10000, and PAD-UFES-20 datasets, respectively.

AB Aiming at large-scale decision-makers (DMs) and the loss of decision sample information in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM), a novel statistical estimation method incorporating the reliability and entropy of linguistic distribution assessment is proposed. First, classify the large-scale DMs into several subgroups according to their prior decision efficiency distribution. After clustering, collect the five-number summary of the incomplete decision sample information provided by the DMs in the subgroups. Second, estimate the mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis of the decision sample via the Cornish-Fisher expansion. Then utilize the Bayes estimation to address the reliability of the subgroups, thereby obtaining the confidence interval, which is used to develop the interval linguistic distribution preference relation (ILDPR) for the subgroups. Moreover, combine the reliability and the entropy measure constructed by the above four estimators to determine subgroup weights. Furthermore, present the expectation and variance of the ILDPR to sort the alternatives. Finally, demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed LSGDM method based on a case and a comparison.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL; SLIDING MODE
AB Typically the longitudinal and lateral control is separate for the tracking control of autonomous vehicles, especially for vehicles distributed driven at rear wheels. It may cause problems, such as high computation complexity and low performance. This paper proposes a trajectory tracking control algorithm with coupling of longitudinal and lateral control. In the presented algorithm, the trajectory tracking errors in lateral direction, heading angle error and speed error, and the allocation of longitudinal forces to the driven wheels are taken accounted in a cost function. By using model predictive control (MPC) method, the front wheel steering angle and the longitudinal force of the driving wheels are optimized in one step with no further need of torque allocation. A torque control algorithm is designed based on the target longitudinal force obtained and tire characteristics. Longitudinal forces are fulfilled through sliding control to achieve vehicle velocity. Stability of this algorithm is validated through map of beta-(beta)overdot method. This paper conducted simulation analysis on typical scenarios such as skid pad test, extreme corner turning test, and closed loop test. The results verified that the proposed algorithm has better tracking performance which decreased the lateral error by 14.6% than the decoupled method in closed loop test, and better dynamic response compared to the traditional MPC algorithm that does not consider longitudinal force optimization.

DT Article
DE Mapless navigation; Deep reinforcement learning; Mobile robot
ID DYNAMIC WINDOW APPROACH; OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently received a lot of attention due to its better performance compared to traditional algorithms in mapless navigation tasks. However, random exploration and sparse rewards may lead to inefficient DRL training in complex scenarios. In this paper, we first propose a gap-guided controller switching strategy to significantly improve the training efficiency of DRL by introducing human-designed priori knowledge. Specifically, we design a reward-based controller switching algorithm that allows the priori controller (expert) to correct the robot behavior in case of poor DRL controller performance, which can avoid random exploration during training. In addition, a gap detection algorithm is used as an online-mapless planner to compute a passable sub-goal within a limited field of view, ensuring that the robot receives dense rewards in complex scenarios. In summary, our method incorporates prior knowledge into network training by combining online-mapless planner and expert demonstration, which greatly improves training efficiency. We apply our method to mapless navigation tasks in both simulation and real worlds to demonstrate that the proposed method improves exploration efficiency by 62%, total reward by 42%, and training speed by 60% compared to the normal DRL methods.

AB Text detection is the primary task for digitization of ancient books. Different from the common scene text detection tasks (ICDAR, TotalText, etc.), the texts in handwritten ancient documents are more densely distributed and generally small objects; at the same time, the layout structure is also more complex, with problems such as mixed arrangement of pictures and texts and high background noise, all of which pose challenges for detection. According to the characteristics of ancient book images, this paper proposes a new fusion structure based on Feature Pyramid Networks, and takes FCOS as the baseline model to form a new detector (named RFCOS). We enhance the detection capability for dense and small text instances by adding bottom-up fusion paths, cross-layer connections and weighted fusion. Meanwhile, the loss of high-level feature maps during fusion is reduced by new upsampling method and lateral connections. We verified the effectiveness of our RFCOS on the HWAD (Handwritten Ancient Books Dataset), a dataset containing samples in four languages -Yi, Chinese, Tibetan and Tangut, and verify the generalization of RFCOS on another public dataset MTHv2. The results show that RFCOS outperformed most of the existing text detectors in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, due to their excellent prediction capabilities, the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in software has significantly increased. One of the most important aspects of ANNs is robustness. Most existing studies on robustness focus on adversarial attacks and complete redundancy schemes in ANNs. Such redundancy methods for robustness are not easily applicable in modern embedded systems. This work presents a study, based on simulations, about the robustness of ANNs used for prediction purposes based on weight alterations. We devise a method to increase the robustness of ANNs directly from ANN characteristics. By using this method, only the most important neurons/connections are replicated, keeping the additional hardware overheads to a minimum. For implementation and evaluation purposes, the networks-on-chip (NoC) case, which is the next generation of system-on-chip, was used as a case study. The proposed study/method was validated using simulations and can be used for larger and different types of networks and hardware due to its scalable nature. The simulation results obtained using different PARSEC (Princeton Application Repository for Shared-Memory Computers) benchmark suite traffic show that a high level of robustness can be achieved with minimum hardware requirements in comparison to other works.

AB Integrated gradients is an explainable AI technique that aims to explain the relationship between a model's predictions in terms of its features. Adapting this technique to point clouds and semantic segmentation models allows a class-wise attribution of the predictions with respect to the input features. This allows better insight into how a model reached a prediction. Furthermore, it allows a quantitative analysis of how much each feature contributes to a prediction. To obtain these attributions, a baseline with high entropy is generated and interpolated with the point cloud to be visualized. These interpolated point clouds are then run through the network and their gradients are collected. By observing the change in gradients during each iteration an attribution can be found for each input feature. These can then be projected back onto the original point cloud and compared to the predictions and input point cloud. These attributions are generated using RandLA-Net due to it being an efficient semantic segmentation model that uses comparatively few parameters, therefore keeping the number of gradients that must be stored at a reasonable level. The attribution was run on the public Semantic3D dataset and the SVGEO large-scale urban dataset.

AB As an indispensable branch of unsupervised learning, deep clustering is rapidly emerging along with the growth of deep neural networks. Recently, contrastive learning paradigm has been combined with deep clustering to achieve more competitive performance. However, previous works mostly employ random augmentations to construct sample pairs for contrastive clustering. Different augmentations of a sample are treated as positive sample pairs, which may result in false positives and ignore the semantic variations of different samples. To address these limitations, we present a novel end-to-end contrastive clustering framework termed Contrastive Clustering with Effective Sample pairs construction (CCES), which obtains more semantic information by jointly leveraging an effective data augmentation method ContrastiveCrop and constructing positive sample pairs based on nearest-neighbor mining. Specifically, we augment original samples by adopting ContrastiveCrop, which explicitly reduces false positives and enlarges the variance of samples. Further, with the extracted feature representations, we provide a strategy to construct positive sample pairs via a sample and its nearest neighbor for instance-wise and cluster-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on four challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CCES for clustering, which surpasses the state-of-the-art deep clustering methods.

AB Traditional sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR), which requires a large amount of high quality data of a new class for training, can hardly classify new-class activities given only a few labeled samples. Using these models to customize and recognize personalized (new class) activity for a better user experience is a great challenge. It is time-consuming work for users to label abundant new-class time series data. Additionally, these activity sequences are weakly-labeled with existing annotation technology. The purpose of this work is to learn a meta-classifier that generalizes well in weakly-labeled new-class activities even given few noisy samples. On this basis, we combine the power of few-shot learning and weakly supervised classification to achieve the above goal. We propose a novel self-relation attention Prototypical Networks for personalized HAR to extract more discriminative target features from the spatiotemporal features of noisy sensor data. Attention-based meta-learning generates each subsequence contribution to the object activity features automatically on the subsequence-level relation mining in one weakly labeled sample. Therefore, the highlighted object activity features are less affected by the noisy subsequences. Furthermore, we design an augmentation operation for the highlighted features to avoid the biased target activity prototype in each class. Finally, we evaluate the proposed models in extensive experiments, including accuracy evaluations, ablation studies and the influence of thresholds. The results show that our proposal achieves a better performance in weakly-supervised HAR compared with other models. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Active perception/vision exploits the ability of robots to interact with their environment, for example move in space, towards increasing the quantity or quality of information obtained through their sensors and, thus, improving their performance in various perception tasks. Active face recognition is largely understudied in recent literature. Attempting to tackle this situation, in this paper, we propose an active approach that utilizes facial views produced by photorealistic facial image rendering. Essentially, the robot that performs the recognition selects the best among a number of candidate movements around the person of interest by simulating their results through view synthesis. This is accomplished by feeding the robot's face recognizer with a real-world facial image acquired in the current position, generating synthesized views that differ by +/-theta degrees from the current view and deciding, based on the confidence of the recognizer, whether to stay in place or move to the position that corresponds to one of the two synthesized views, in order to acquire a new real image with its sensor. Experimental results in three datasets verify the superior performance of the proposed method compared to the respective "static" approach, approaches based on the same face recognizer that involve synthetic face frontalization and synthesized views, random direction robot movement, robot movement towards a frontal location based on view angle estimation, as well as a state of the art active method. Results from a proof of concept simulation in a robotic simulator are also provided.

AB The objective of semantic segmentation in cross-modal medicine is to align the distribution among dif-ferent domains. The images from different domains contain various styles and boundary information, which the previous method ignores. Inspired by this observation, we considered employing the style and boundary information from features. We proposed a simple but effective way containing a style adaptation module and boundary enhancement module to facilitate the medical semantic segmentation on an unlabeled domain. In particular, the style adaptation module highlights the style information from the deep features through Fast Fourier Transform and low pass filter to assist in aligning the domain dis-tributions. The boundary enhancement module utilizes the phase spectrum of features to obtain the boundary information and improve the segmentation ability by aggregating the boundary information. Results from experiments on two public datasets show that our proposed method effectively improves the segmentation performance of unlabeled target images and outperforms the most advanced domain adaptation approaches. Both qualitative and quantitative results evaluate the effectiveness of style fea-tures and boundary information in domain alignment.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study conducted a lexicon-based content analysis of building information modeling (BIM) logs from four major BIM authoring tools and four custom-developed BIM loggers to understand whether the BIM logs satisfy the information requirements for various BIM log mining use cases, as well as to assess their potential for future development and research. First, through a critical review of previous studies, 19 different ways of using BIM logs were identified, including authoring and collaborative pattern discovery, authoring process modeling, collaboration pattern analysis, command predictions, and team optimization; however, most of the uses con-cerned process discovery. The analysis also revealed that BIM log mining has mainly been used for the design phase, with a few examples of being used for the construction phase. For BIM log mining, various techniques ranging from simple frequency analyses via social network analyses to advanced pattern discovery were deployed. In terms of BIM log sources, native BIM logs from Revit were dominantly used almost in all studies, aside from a few studies that used custom-developed BIM logs. The content analysis of BIM logs showed that the contents of native BIM logs provided by major BIM authoring tools varied, but commonly lacked model-element-specific information; this limitation prevents in-depth analyses of BIM processes. Overall, the current dispro-portionate focus on process discovery in the design phase of BIM log mining suggests that the application of BIM log mining is still in its early stages and holds significant potential for other project phases if adding model-element-specific information is incorporated.

AB The opportunities for leveraging technology to enhance the efficiency of vessel port activities are vast. Applying video analytics to model and optimize certain processes offers a remarkable way to improve overall operations. Within the realm of vessel port activities, two crucial processes are vessel approximation and the docking process. This work specifically focuses on developing a vessel velocity estimation model and a docking mooring analytical system using a computer vision approach. The study introduces algorithms for speed estimation and mooring bitt detection, leveraging techniques such as the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for precise image comparison. The obtained results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, demonstrating satisfactory speed estimation capabilities and successful identification of tied cables on the mooring bitts. These advancements pave the way for enhanced safety and efficiency in vessel docking procedures. However, further research and improvements are necessary to address challenges related to occlusions and illumination variations and explore additional techniques to enhance the models' performance and applicability in real-world scenarios.

The concepts and indicators characterizing the processes of agricultural operations of the machine fleet in the agrarian business are considered. A classification of approaches for optimizing the implementation of a complex of mechanized agro-technical operations is given. We systemize different views on the problems under study and possible solutions. The advantages of the proposed model and algorithm, as well as the problematic aspects of their information and instrumental support are discussed. The problem of choosing the optimality criterion when setting the formal problem of optimizing agricultural operations by a fleet of machines in the agricultural field is considered. A modification of the economic and mathematical model for optimizing the structure and production schedules of the machine and tractor fleet is developed. The model is applied in a numerical experiment using real data of a specific agricultural enterprise, and the economic interpretation of the results is discussed. We apply an approach for determining the economic effect of the use of the developed model and algorithm. The possibilities for practical application of the obtained results of the study are substantiated.

AB For multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs), there are multiple equivalent Pareto optimal solutions in the decision space that are corresponding to the same objective value. Therefore, the main tasks of multimodal multi-objective optimization (MMO) are to find a high-quality PF approximation in the objective space and maintain the population diversity in the decision space. To achieve the above objectives, this article proposes a zoning search-based multimodal multi-objective brain storm optimization algorithm (ZS-MMBSO). At first, the search space segmentation method is employed to divide the search space into some sub-regions. Moreover, a novel individual generation strategy is incorporated into the multimodal multi-objective brain storm optimization algorithm, which can improve the search performance of the search engineering. The proposed algorithm is compared with five famous multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMOEAs) on IEEE CEC2019 MMOPs benchmark test suite. Experimental results indicate that the overall performance of the ZS-MMBSO is the best among all competitors.

AB Sudden air pollution accidents (explosions, fires, leaks, etc.) in chemical industry parks may result in great harm to people's lives, property, and the ecological environment. A gas tracking network can monitor hazardous gas diffusion using traceability technology combined with sensors distributed within the scope of a chemical industry park. Such systems can automatically locate the source of pollutants in a timely manner and notify relevant departments to take major hazards into their control. However, tracing the source of the leak in a large area is still a tough problem, especially within an urban area. In this paper, the diffusion of 79 potential leaking sources with consideration of different weather conditions and complex urban terrain is simulated by AERMOD. Only 61 sensors are used to monitor the gas concentration within such a large scale. A fully connected network trained with a hybrid strategy is proposed to trace the leaking source effectively and robustly. Our proposed model reaches a final classification accuracy of 99.14%.

DE distributional reinforcement learning; sequential decision-making;

AB Classical reinforcement learning (RL) techniques are generally concerned with the design of decision-making policies driven by the maximisation of the expected outcome. Nevertheless, this approach does not take into consideration the potential risk associated with the actions taken, which may be critical in certain applications. To address that issue, the present research work introduces a novel methodology based on distributional RL to derive sequential decision-making policies that are sensitive to the risk, the latter being modelled by the tail of the return probability distribution. The core idea is to replace the Q function generally standing at the core of learning schemes in RL by another function, taking into account both the expected return and the risk. Named the risk-based utility function U, it can be extracted from the random return distribution Z naturally learnt by any distributional RL algorithm. This enables the spanning of the complete potential trade-off between risk minimisation and expected return maximisation, in contrast to fully risk-averse methodologies. Fundamentally, this research yields a truly practical and accessible solution for learning risk-sensitive policies with minimal modification to the distributional RL algorithm, with an emphasis on the interpretability of the resulting decision-making process.

AB This paper presents a dynamic modeling and trajectory tracking control design for a hyper-redundant continuum manipulator (HRM), which is able to continuously bend along its length. The HRM has the advantages of high flexibility, large workspace, and low inertia, but also poses challenges of complex kinematics, and dynamic coupling. To address these challenges, the kinematics model was developed based on the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) assumption that captures the relationship between the cable lengths, joint angles, and end-effector pose. Inverse kinematics is presented geometrically by solving trigonometric equations. The dynamic model for the continuum robot (CR) is derived using the Euler-Lagrange representation, which incorporates the effects of gravity and elasticity. Accordingly, three control strategies are developed and applied to a two-section continuum robot, which are the inverse dynamic proportional integral derivative controller (PID), fuzzy logic controller (FLC), and sliding mode controller (SMC). We validate our proposed methods through simulations on various 3D trajectories, utilized MATLAB symbolic math toolbox in conjunction with Simulink simulation; demonstrate and evaluate different close-loop dynamic control responses for different scenarios. This simulation used in the creation of a unique animated simulation for a whole 3D continuum robot while tracking its desired trajectories. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methods can effectively control the HRM with high tracking performance, exhibiting enhanced responses in terms of settling time, rising time, and steady-state error. While the developed SMC outperforms Poth's PID and FLC in terms of robustness and settling time (51% and 10.3%), respectively.

AB This paper presents an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platform used for the competition held at the International Conference for Unmanned Aircraft Systems 2022 (ICUAS'22). The envisioned scenario in the competition is delivering an extinguishing ball to a fire with a UAV. Driven on that thought, the qualifying round of the competition is organized in a realistic simulation environment. The competitors are required to navigate through a cluttered environment into a free space, where they perform a search for the target and deliver the ball as close as possible to that target. The competition finals were organized as a part of the conference, with the same goal as in the simulation qualifiers. The UAVs used for the competition are prepared and provided by the organizers. A detailed description of the UAV software and hardware is outlined in the paper as a step towards standardizing aerial research platform.

ID PATH-FOLLOWING CONTROL; SUBJECT
AB This paper presents an AD*-based technique for fast, dynamically feasible path replanning for collision avoidance of anguilliform-inspired articulated mobile robots operating in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles in underwater environments. Although a few past approaches have addressed the problem of the generation of dynamically feasible paths in the presence of static obstacles, to the best of our knowledge, path planning in the case of fish-inspired robots in the presence of dynamic obstacles has not been explored. We employ a lattice-based approach to generate dynamically feasible reachable nodes and, thereby, a search graph that captures the robot's kinodynamic constraints and accounts for the interaction with surrounding fluid flow. We employ proximity sensors to sense the dynamic obstacles for replanning. Moreover, a simple vector-based time-to-collision and collision state prediction method has been proposed to adapt the problem to a graph-search approach. We found that the developed approach could avoid collision with dynamic obstacles moving at 1.5 times the robot's speed, with a maximum success rate of around 78%. The average success rate obtained using the developed technique is 70%, which is more than the success rate obtained using D*-Lite for the examples reported in this paper. The developed approach can impart autonomy to fish-inspired robots operating in unstructured and cluttered environments.

AB A UAV equipped with an RGB-D camera and a downward facing optical flow sensor is set to explore an unknown indoor 3D-volume. The UAV's visual odometry is accomplished through the fusion of IMU, depth readings and the optical flow sensor. While the UAV is moving using a skeletal path to avoid collisions between the surrounding obstacles, it computes features from the environment. These features assist the UAV to localize itself in a self-identified map using the RTAB-Map SLAM. The UAV moves to the fire-alike target-set and for the unexplored area it uses a Chebyshev shortest path from the boundary free cells to the boundary of the target-set. Due to SLAM-induced errors, the UAV employs virtual potential fields and local depth measurements for obstacle avoidance. Upon detection of the target, comprised as a fiducial marker to emulate a fire-source, the UAV uses a ballistic trajectory to propel its payload (fire extinguishing material) towards the target. Simulation studies using Unity for photo-realistic indoor imaging, Gazebo for the UAV dynamics and ROS as intermediate between these components is used to validate the suggested scheme.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; ROBOT; NAVIGATION; SUBJECT
AB We consider the problem of multi-robot path planning in a complex, cluttered environment with the aim of reducing overall congestion in the environment, while avoiding any inter-robot communication or coordination. Such limitations may exist due to lack of communication or due to privacy restrictions (for example, autonomous vehicles may not want to share their locations or intents with other vehicles or even to a central server). The key insight that allows us to solve this problem is to stochastically distribute the robots across different routes in the environment by assigning them paths in different topologically distinct classes, so as to lower congestion and the overall travel time for all robots in the environment. We outline the computation of topologically distinct paths in a spatio-temporal configuration space and propose methods for the stochastic assignment of paths to the robots. A fast replanning algorithm and a potential field based controller allow robots to avoid collision with nearby agents while following the assigned path. Our simulation and experiment results show a significant advantage over shortest path following under such a coordination-free setup.

AB For the spherical robot, an efficient and precise velocity controller suitable for different terrains is crucial. In this paper, a new Riccati controller with feedforward compensation based on Kalman observer (FKO-Riccati controller) with better control performance and stronger robustness is proposed for velocity control of the spherical robot. An accurate dynamic model of the robot is established. Based on the model, a Riccati controller with velocity tracking performance and a Kalman velocity observer are proposed, and the output is feedforward compensated. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller, a series of experiments were conducted using a spherical robot named Rotunbot. The simulations and experimental results show that no matter what terrain the robot was in, compared with the traditional PID controller, the FKO-Riccati controller had better control performance and stronger robustness, whether it was going straight or turning.

ID AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; CONNECTIVITY
AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that can reduce quality of life and burden families. However, there is a lack of objectivity in clinical diagnosis, so it is very important to develop a method for early and accurate diagnosis. Multi-site data increases sample size and statistical power, which is convenient for training deep learning models. However, heterogeneity between sites will affect ASD recognition. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-site anti-interference neural network for ASD classification. The resting state brain functional image data provided by the multi-site is used to train the ASD classification model. The model consists of three modules. First, the site feature extraction module is used to quantify the inter-site heterogeneity, in which the autoencoder is used to reduce the feature dimension. Secondly, the presentation learning module is used to extract classification features. Finally, the anti-interference classification module uses the output of the first two modules as labels and inputs for multi-task adversarial training to complete the representation learning that is not affected by the confounding of sites, so as to realize the adaptive anti-interference ASD classification. The results show that the average accuracy of ten-fold cross validation is 75.56%, which is better than the existing studies. The innovation of our proposed method lies in the problem that the traditional single-task deep learning ASD classification model will be affected by the heterogeneity of multi-site data and interfere with the classification. Our method eliminates the influence of multi-site factors on feature extraction through multi-task adversarial training, so that the model can better adapt to the heterogeneity of multi-site data. Meanwhile, large-scale 1DconV is introduced to extract features of brain functional network, which provides support for the interpretability of the model. This method is expected to take advantage of multiple sites and provide reference for early diagnosis and treatment of ASD.

AB On delivery operations, vehicle routing problems regularly focus on optimizing route-solution quality. How-ever, the real-life execution of routes often differs from the computed routing plan. Therefore, the routing algorithms should use information from historic routes and drivers' decisions to make the planned route as similar as possible to the actual executed route. We study the problem of predicting route sequences that drivers follow in last-mile parcel delivery in the context of the 2021 Amazon Last-Mile Routing Research Challenge. We propose extracting information from historic routes using a probability estimation method that learns transition probabilities between clusters or zones, coupled with a simple yet effective two-stage Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) to incorporate the information from historical route data into route planning. Our GRASP includes components in the objective function that consider decisions observed on the historical route sequences supplied by Amazon. We evaluate the predicted route sequences using the score similarity metric provided in the Amazon challenge. The results show that our method obtains a similarity score of 0.0328, which is comparable to the scores achieved by the three winning teams of the Amazon challenge. The proposed method successfully uses historical routes to predict route sequences on a last-mile delivery setting.

AB With the development of booming AutoML systems, modeling processes have become more automatic for researchers. However, AutoML systems may struggle to identify the optimal surrogate type, find the best combination of the hyper-parameters or establish a high-fidelity ensembled surrogate model for certain datasets. To address these issues and further improve the warm-start procedure of AutoML, a Ranking Prediction Strategy assisted Automatic Model Selection (RPS-AMS) method is proposed. In the suggested method, an integration of evolutionary algorithms (EA-based) and feature-based driven model selection strategy selects the best or the best combination models for prediction. Based on the proposed criteria, an XGBoost regression model is trained to determine the rankings from the candidate surrogate models and then build an ensembled surrogate model to further enhance accuracy. We evaluate RPS-AMS using 13 mathematical functions, 14 public datasets, and a real engineering problem. Compared with the popular modeling tools, such as Auto-Sklearn and EvalML, the RPSAMS outperforms in term of accuracy while maintaining the performances of ergodic methods of all surrogate models. The accuracies of RPS-AMS rival EvalML in most tested datasets, although RPS-AMS may be slightly less efficient. Given that EvalML is a masterpiece of the AutoML systems, the performances of RPS-AMS are promising. This code is available at: https://github.com/HnuAiSimOpt/RPS-AMS.

AB Loop closure detection(LCD) is an essential part of the visual SLAM system, which can reduce the cumulative error caused by drift. LCD based on traditional methods adopts artificially designed image features. However, this method lacks semantic information and is vulnerable to the external lighting environment. Aiming at the problem of missing information in the image feature representation of LCD, this article proposes a feature extraction method based on multi-layer feature fusion of the lightweight network SqueezeNet. This method can reduce the loss of location and detail information and significantly improve the feature-matching accuracy and extraction rate. Then we employ the nonlinear KPCA method to reduce the dimension of the extracted image feature vectors. In addition, in order to prevent the error matching of adjacent images and the long matching time, we propose an adaptive range matching algorithm, which adaptively limits the matching range in the matching feature stage and jumps out of unnecessary candidate ranges by setting corresponding thresholds and dictionaries of candidate key frames. It not only improves the accuracy of LCD but also dramatically reduces the matching time. The extensive experiments on relevant datasets show that the proposed method has higher accuracy and rate than other methods of CNNs, achieving better robustness and real-time requirements and proving the method's effectiveness for LCD.

AB Legged manipulators are a prime candidate for reducing risk to human lives through completing tasks in hazardous environments. However, controlling these systems in real-world applications requires a highly functional teleoperation framework, capable of leveraging all utility of the robot to complete tasks. In this work, such a teleoperation framework is presented, where a wearable whole-body motion capture suit is integrated with a whole-body controller specialised for teleoperation and a set of teleoperation strategies that enable the control of all main frames of the robot along with additional functions. Within the whole-body controller, all tasks and constraints can be configured dynamically due to their modularity, hence enabling seamless transitions between each teleoperation strategy. As a result, this not only enables the realisation of trajectories outside the workspace without the whole-body controller but also the ability to complete tasks that would require an additional manipulator if just the gripper frames of the robot were controllable. To validate the presented framework, a set of real robot experiments have been completed to demonstrate all teleoperation strategies and analyse their proficiency.

ID IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; MRI; LORAKS
AB Recently, untrained neural networks (UNNs) have shown satisfactory performances for MR image reconstruction on random sampling trajectories without using additional full-sampled training data. However, the existing UNN-based approaches lack the modeling of physical priors, resulting in poor performance in some common scenarios (e.g., partial Fourier (PF), regular sampling, etc.) and the lack of theoretical guarantees for reconstruction accuracy. To bridge this gap, we propose a safeguarded k-space interpolation method for MRI using a specially designed UNN with a tripled architecture driven by three physical priors of the MR images (or k-space data), including transform sparsity, coil sensitivity smoothness, and phase smoothness. We also prove that the proposed method guarantees tight bounds for interpolated k-space data accuracy. Finally, ablation experiments show that the proposed method can characterize the physical priors of MR images well. Additionally, experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional parallel imaging methods and existing UNNs, and is even competitive against supervised-trained deep learning methods in PF and regular undersampling reconstruction.

AB Node classification tasks on graphs are addressed via fully-trained deep message-passing models that learn a hierarchy of node representations via multiple aggregations of a node's neighbourhood. While effective on graphs that exhibit a high ratio of intra-class edges, this approach poses challenges in the opposite case, i.e. heterophily, where nodes belonging to the same class are usually further apart. In graphs with a high degree of heterophily, the smoothed representations based on close neighbours com-puted by convolutional models are no longer effective. So far, architectural variations in message-passing models to reduce excessive smoothing or rewiring the input graph to improve longer-range message passing have been proposed. In this paper, we address the challenges of heterophilic graphs with Graph Echo State Network (GESN) for node classification. GESN is a reservoir computing model for graphs, where node embeddings are recursively computed by an untrained message-passing function. Our experiments show that reservoir models are able to achieve better or comparable accuracy with respect to most fully trained deep models that implement ad hoc variations in the architectural bias or perform rewiring as a preprocessing step on the input graph, with an improvement in terms of effi-ciency/accuracy trade-off. Furthermore, our analysis shows that GESN is able to effectively encode the structural relationships of a graph node, by showing a correlation between iterations of the recursive embedding function and the distribution of shortest paths in a graph.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study introduces a novel functional link neural network and explores the associated theorems for a class of nonlinear differential equations with fractional variable-order and time-varying delays. Lagrange polynomials, known for their efficiency in solving fractional calculus problems, are utilized as the neuro-solutions within the neural network structure. For an efficient learning process in artificial neural networks, appropriate activation functions play a crucial role. To handle the fractional derivative of variable-order and time-varying delays, it is essential to select the right activation function. Hence, numerical simulations are conducted to determine the optimal activation function for these equations. The training of the neural network is done using a modified Newton-Raphson method instead of the traditional supervised learning methods. As a result, the proposed functional link neural network provides more accurate results compared to conventional neural networks like the multilayer perceptron.

AB In many parts of the globe, heart disease or cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality. It is a group of conditions that includes heart failure and other cardiac problems. In the USA, there are an estimated 356,000 cases of hospital cardiac arrest every year, 90% of which are fatal, as reported by the American Heart Association (Tsao et al. in Circulation https:// doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001052, 2022). However, the survival rate may be improved by routine monitoring of cardiac function in order to detect the illness at an early stage. Many formerly intractable medical issues have made significant progress because of the combination of computer technology and biomedical research. Automatic prediction is made possible by the examination of previously learned data in machine learning. In this research, we utilize the Physionet Cinc/C Challenge 2016 Phonocardiogram dataset. Classification models like K-nearest neighbour (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AlexNet are used with the features retrieved using wavelet scattering transform and continuous wavelet transform. The primary objective of this work is to provide a very effective method for early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders, which will help clinical professionals better spot heart issues in their patients. Sensitivity, Specificity and other performance metrics are used to assess the effectiveness of the various categorization models. KNN, SVM, and AlexNet classifiers all achieve good accuracy with AlexNet outperforms the former two giving an accuracy of 98.11%, with a sensitivity of 96.20% and a specificity of 98.73%. Our suggested model's output has the potential to contribute significantly to the categorization of cardiac sounds.

AB This paper presents a new approach for consensus-based group decision making using bipolar fuzzy sets (BFSs). BFSs are effective tools for handling bipolarity and fuzziness, and they have been applied in various fields such as artificial intelligence, data science, and economics. However, there are currently no aggregation operators (AOs) that can aggregate criteria values in a bipolar fuzzy (BF) environment with the desired flexibility and generality, nor any consensus-reaching process proposed to capture the uncertainty of information when some experts are biased. To address these issues, the paper proposes bipolar fuzzy (BF) Archimedean-Dombi weighted aggregation operators (AOs) based consensus decision-making approach. The BF Archimedean-Dombi weighted averaging (BFADWA) and BF Archimedean-Dombi weighted geometric (BFADWG) AOs are proposed, and a consensus-based group decision-making methodology is developed. The criteria weights are calculated using Grey Correlation Coefficient. A case study with four experts is conducted to assess four Open-Source Software Learning Management Systems over a range of nine criteria. To confirm the consistency of the methodology, a comparative study is performed with other existing tools based on BF Dombi weighted averaging and geometric AOs, BF Hamacher weighted averaging and geometric AOs. Results show that the method generates the same ranking order and is more realistic and flexible. The proposed method can be applied to various fields where consensus-based group decision-making is required, providing a new perspective for handling uncertainty and bias in decision-making.

AB In recent years, scientists have developed a new type of algorithm called convolutional neural network algorithm in the field of neural networks. This algorithm not only has a powerful image recognition function, but also can distinguish and arrange data images. At the same time, the algorithm's recognition and processing functions are also very powerful, are able to identify relatively hidden images and process a very large image library in a short time. The research content of this article is the application and development of ceramic image creation based on the classification effect of neural network and the characteristics of quantum particle swarm algorithm. And according to the principles, standards, characteristics of neural network classification and the characteristics and technology of particle swarm algorithm, the traditional LB G algorithm and an improved LB G algorithm are discussed, and simulation experiments are carried out. During the experiment, the staff analyzed and optimized the specific process of the quantum particle swarm algorithm through a large number of calculations and simulation experiments. And according to the classification of neural network and quantum particle swarm algorithm, the researchers also proposed a set of practical ceramic image design methods. Through the inspection and comparison of the design results, the researchers preliminarily judged that the design method is not only practical, but also has many advantages such as recognition, high accuracy and good visual experience. At the same time, the staff also optimized the method based on the preliminary design results.

AB In this paper we investigate the role of self-learning agents in multi-agent models of financial markets. We develop an agent-based simulation model of a financial market and, in addition to the agents with fixed strategies used in previous research, we introduce an agent with a self-learning strategy. To model the behavior of such an agent, we use deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Next, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of the constructed model with outcomes of previously proposed models, as well as with the characteristics of real market. To conduct comparative analysis, we use stylized facts of asset returns that allow us to evaluate and compare the characteristics of the markets. Our results show that a model with a self-learning agent gives a better approximation of the real market than a model with classic agents. In particular, unlike the model with classical agents, the model with a self-learning agent turns out to be not so heavy-tailed. Thus, we demonstrate that for a complete understanding of market processes simulation models should take into account self-learning agents that have a significant presence at modern financial markets.Finally, we present the python package1, which was developed by us as part of the research implementation. This package allows to simulate the financial market, as well as create your own agents and evaluate their impact on the market.

AB A big challenge in dealing with real-world problems is scalability. In fact, this is partially the reason behind the success of deep learning over other learning paradigms. Here, we tackle the scalability of a novel learning paradigm proposed in 2021 based solely on self-organizing principles. This paradigm consists of only dynamical equations which self-organize with the input to create attractor-repeller points that are related to the patterns found in data. To achieve scalability for such a system, we propose the Magnum algorithm, which utilizes many self-organizing subsystems (Inertia-SyncMap) each with subsets of the problem's variables. The main idea is that by merging Inertia-SyncMaps, Magnum builds over time a variable correlation by consensus, capable of accurately predicting the structure of large groups of variables. Experiments show that Magnum surpasses or ties with other unsupervised algorithms in all of the high-dimensional chunking problems, each with distinct types of shapes and structural features. Moreover, Inertia-SyncMap alone outperforms or ties with other unsupervised algorithms in six out of seven basic chunking problems. Thus, this work sheds light on how self-organization learning paradigms can be scaled up to deal with high-dimensional structures and compete with current learning paradigms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In personalized recommender systems, the collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation approaches have been widely used to predict the preferences of users in real-world applications. Among them, Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) attracts much attention as it can easily explore the binary form of implicit feedback. However, it still suffers from the absence problem of negative feedback. To address this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid-feedback collaborative filtering model by jointly exploiting the explicit and implicit feedback. Based on the assumption that users prefer items with high ratings, this work firstly introduces the definition of explicit rating data to the BPR model and further proposes an improved Bayesian personalized ranking (IBPR) model to jointly extract the implicit feedback features of users and items. The IBPR model alleviates the problem of lack of negative feedback and promotes the anti-noise performance of the recommender system. Then the IBPR and BiasSVD (Biased Singular Value Decomposition) models are combined to further extract explicit latent features of users as well as items and construct the hybrid-feedback CF model. In this model, the user-item ranking matrix is reconstructed based on the extracted implicit feedback features, and the rating matrix is constructed based on the extracted explicit feedback features. Our proposed method is evaluated on five public datasets and achieves the competitive performance.

AB The main challenge of long-term tracking includes data uncertainty in long-term observations. Previous methods tackle the long-term tracking task by online update-based trackers. However, sophisticated online update strategies of these trackers are usually with a considerable computational burden. In this work, a contrastive learning-based online optimizer-assisted long-term tracking framework (named LTCO) is proposed to guide the online tracker to make more accurate update decisions while reducing the impact of online updates on tracking speed. Specifically, the optimizer first perceives the similarity between distractors and positive samples through metric learning. Next, the contrastive learning between target anchors and hard negative samples forces the optimizer to notice the difference between targets and distractors. Finally, the optimizer will learn a binary output to assist the tracker updating. The proposed optimizer can be easily integrated into other online trackers with little impact on their running speed. Extensive experimental results show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VOT2018LT, VOT2019LT, OxUvA, and LaSOT benchmarks while running at real-time speed on GPU.

DE Continual learning; Saliency map; Experience replay; Episodic memory;
   Online adaptation
AB Artificial learning systems aspire to mimic human intelligence by continually learning from a stream of tasks without forgetting past knowledge. One way to enable such learning is to store past experiences in the form of input examples in episodic memory and replay them when learning new tasks. However, performance of such method suffers as the size of the memory becomes smaller. In this paper, we propose a new approach for experience replay, where we select the past experiences by looking at the saliency maps, which provide visual explanations for the model's decision. Guided by these saliency maps, we pack the memory with only the parts or patches of the input images important for the model's prediction. While learning a new task, we replay these memory patches with appropriate zero-padding to remind the model about its past decisions. We evaluate our algorithm on CIFAR-100, miniImageNet and CUB datasets and report better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches. We perform a detailed study to show the effectiveness of zero-padded patch replay compared to the other candidate approaches. Moreover, with qualitative and quantitative analyses we show that our method captures richer summaries of past experiences without any memory increase and hence performs well with small episodic memory.

ID TRACKING
AB Our objective is to locate and provide a unique identifier for each mouse in a cluttered home-cage environment through time, as a precursor to automated behaviour recognition for biological research. This is a very challenging problem due to (i) the lack of distinguishing visual features for each mouse, and (ii) the close confines of the scene with constant occlusion, making standard visual tracking approaches unusable. However, a coarse estimate of each mouse's location is available from a unique RFID implant, so there is the potential to optimally combine information from (weak) tracking with coarse information on identity. To achieve our objective, we make the following key contributions: (a) the formulation of the object identification problem as an assignment problem (solved using Integer Linear Programming), (b) a novel probabilistic model of the affinity between tracklets and RFID data, and (c) a curated dataset with per-frame BB and regularly spaced ground-truth annotations for evaluating the models. The latter is a crucial part of the model, as it provides a principled probabilistic treatment of object detections given coarse localisation. Our approach achieves 77% accuracy on this animal identification problem, and is able to reject spurious detections when the animals are hidden.

With the development of artificial intelligence, many style transfer methods have emerged, which focus on stylizing content features in different aspects, such as loss functions, attention mechanism, and functional instance normalization layer. However, there are still problems such as the lack of local detail information or the insufficient degree of style fusion in the generated images. To get more realistic images, we propose an Enhanced-Channel Module, which vectorizes content feature maps and style feature maps to generate content-aware channel weights. The channel weights are multiplied by the content feature maps as the map offsets to complete the style injection. Meanwhile, in order to utilize the multilayer feature maps, we train the network in a progressive rendering way using multilayer content features and deep style features. The comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art methods prove that the proposed method can generate high-quality stylization results in artistic style transfer and video style transfer tasks, and the ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the different components.

AB The pinning-like bipartite synchronization is investigated for reaction-diffusion neural networks with cooperative-competitive interactions in this paper. First, a dural event-triggered control algorithm based on the time-space sampled-data scheme is employed to further decrease the transmission resources' consumption. Then, some sufficient conditions that guarantee the bipartite synchronization for the target neural networks with the signed graph are obtained by virtue of the Lyapunov method, Halanay's inequalities, and the pinning control technique. Moreover, new weighted integral inequalities are intro-duced to get higher upper bounds than what traditional inequality produces. Finally, a numerical simu-lation result is given to validate the advantages of the proposed method for realizing bipartite synchronization.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Camouflaged object, similar to the background, shows indistinct boundaries and low-contrast features, which brings great challenges to the detection task. Moreover, existing models still suffer from coarse object boundaries. Motivated by the complementary relationship between boundaries and camouflaged object regions, we propose an alternate guidance network named AGNet for better interaction between them. Specifically, we first propose feature selective module to select high discriminative features and simultaneously filter out noisy background features. The proposed AGNet follows a locate and refine manner, where multi-scale convolution is applied to expand receptive field for accurate initial coarse localization. Finally, a novel alternate guidance module is designed and embedded into each side-output to refine the previous localization progressively. Contributed by it, the complementary characteristic between the region and boundary features can be well captured, which is beneficial to obtain more complete detection. Experimental results on five COD datasets prove the effectiveness of our model, and it is superior to existing state-of-the-art models in object accuracy and boundary accuracy.

ID FLUID-INJECTION; SITE
AB Fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an emerging technology for vibration measurements with numerous applications in seismic signal analysis, including microseismicity detection, ambient noise tomography, earthquake source characterization, and active source seismology. Using laser-pulse techniques, DAS turns (commercial) fiber-optic cables into seismic arrays with a spatial sampling density of the order of meters and a time sampling rate up to one thousand Hertz. The versatility of DAS enables dense instrumentation of traditionally inaccessible domains, such as urban, glaciated, and submarine environments. This in turn opens up novel applications such as traffic density monitoring and maritime vessel tracking. However, these new environments also introduce new challenges in handling various types of recorded noise, impeding the application of traditional data analysis workflows. In order to tackle the challenges posed by noise, new denoising techniques need to be explored that are tailored to DAS. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning approach that leverages the spatial density of DAS measurements to remove spatially incoherent noise with unknown characteristics. This approach is entirely self-supervised, so no noise-free ground truth is required, and it makes no assumptions regarding the noise characteristics other than that it is spatio-temporally incoherent. We apply our approach to both synthetic and real-world DAS data to demonstrate its excellent performance, even when the signals of interest are well below the noise level. Our proposed methods can be readily incorporated into conventional data processing workflows to facilitate subsequent seismological analyses.

DE Computer vision; Surface anomaly detection; Image reconstruction and
   inpainting; Multi-scale feature enrichment
AB The detection of anomalous structures in natural image data plays a crucial role in numerous tasks in the field of computer vision. Methods based on image reconstruction or inpainting are trained on images with no anomalies or artificial anomalies; anomaly detection and localization are achieved by computing the difference between the input image and the reconstructed image. DR & AELIG;M trains two sub-networks to reduce over-fitting of synthetic appearances. This method uses an encoder-decoder and an U-Net-like network to detect and locate anomalies. In order to further improve the performance of the model in accurate inpainting of abnormal images and pixel-level segmentation, we propose a multi-scale anomaly embedding inpainting and discrimination model (M & AELIG;IDM). The proposed method introduces a trainable multi-scale feature enrichment module (MFEM) in reconstructive sub-network for image inpainting and an attention discriminative sub-network for defect segmentation. In addition, the Gaussian filtering is used to smooth the anomaly score map. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves excellent performance on the anomaly detection dataset MVTec and two unpublished fabric datasets with AUC scores of 98.5% and 98.1% at the image level and pixel level, respectively. Meanwhile, our model further achieves better detection performance on the supervised DAGM surface defect detection dataset, which proves the effectiveness of the method.

DE Terms-Domain adaptation; cross-domain knowledge extraction;
   collaborative training; wasserstein distance
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to utilize knowledge from a label-rich source domain to understand a similar yet distinct unlabeled target domain. Notably, global distribution statistics across domains and local semantic characteristics across samples, are two essential factors of data analysis that should be fully explored. Most existing UDA approaches either harness only one of them or fail to closely associate them for efficient adaptation. In this work, we propose a unified framework, called Collaborative Alignment Framework (CAF), which simultaneously reduces the global domain discrepancy and preserves the local semantic consistency for cross-domain knowledge transfer in a collaborative manner. Specifically, for domain-oriented alignment, we utilize adversarial training or minimize the Wasserstein distance between the two distributions to learn domain-level invariant representations. For semantic-oriented matching, we capture the semantic discrepancy between the predictions of two diverse task-specific classifiers and enhance the features of target data to be near the support of the source data class-wisely, which promotes semantic consistency across domains effectively. These two adaptation processes can be deeply intertwined in CAF via collaborative training, thus CAF can learn domain-invariant and semantic-consistent feature representations. Extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks, including DomainNet, VisDA-2017, Office-31, and ImageCLEF, demonstrate the proposed methods significantly outperform the existing methods, especially on the large-scale dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/CAF.

AB Passenger satisfaction is extremely important for the success of a public transportation system. Many studies have shown that passenger satisfaction strongly depends on the time they have to wait at the bus stop (waiting time) to get on a bus. To be specific, user satisfaction drops faster as the waiting time increases. Therefore, service providers want to provide a bus to the waiting passengers within a threshold to keep them satisfied. It is a two-pronged problem: (a) to satisfy more passengers the transport planner may increase the frequency of the buses, and (b) in turn, the increased frequency may impact the service operational costs. To address it, we propose PASS and COST as the two variants that satisfy different optimization criteria mentioned above. The optimization goal of PASS is the number of satisfied passengers while the optimization goal of COST is the number of passengers served per unit of driving time. Consequently, PASS utilizes resources to the maximum to satisfy the highest number of passengers, while COST optimizes for both passenger satisfaction and operational costs. Accordingly, we propose two algorithms to solve PASS and COST respectively and evaluate their performance based on real passenger demand data-set.

AB Traffic prediction is an important and yet highly challenging problem due to the complexity and constantly changing nature of traffic systems. To address the challenges, we propose a graph and attentive multi-path convolutional network (GAMCN) model to predict traffic conditions such as traffic speed across a given road network into the future. Our model focuses on the spatial and temporal factors that impact traffic conditions. To model the spatial factors, we propose a variant of the graph convolutional network (GCN) named LPGCN to embed road network graph vertices into a latent space, where vertices with correlated traffic conditions are close to each other. To model the temporal factors, we use a multi-path convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the joint impact of different combinations of past traffic conditions on the future traffic conditions. Such a joint impact is further modulated by an attention generated from an embedding of the prediction time, which encodes the periodic patterns of traffic conditions. We evaluate our model on real-world road networks and traffic data. The experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-art traffic prediction models by up to 18.9% in terms of prediction errors and 23.4% in terms of prediction efficiency.

AB Complicated temporal patterns can provide important information for accurate time series forecasting. Existing long short-term memory (LSTM) model with attention mechanism have achieved significant performance. However, the exponential decay of long-term memory of LSTM has not be resolved yet in these efforts, remaining a longstanding open problem in recurrent nature. This problem exhibits a bottleneck which restricts the performance of existing studies. Recently, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown high efficiency in capturing temporal patterns via the surrogate gradient (SG) method to resolve this issue. However, the concept-drift environment makes it impossible to pre-set the variance into the standard SG method due to time-varying data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive and hybrid spiking (AHS) module embedded LSTM, collaborating with two attention mechanisms (called HSN-LSTM) to resolve above-mentioned problems. First, the AHS module is analyzed theoretically can remain long-term memory. Moreover, our smooth SG method avoids pre-setting of variance, which is not sensitive in the above scenarios. Besides, we use the negative log-likelihood function to adjust the attention score for alleviating the negative impact from the concept-drift. Experiment results show the HSN-LSTM outperformed the state-of-the-art models on several multivariate time series datasets.

AB In recent years, context-aware recommender systems (CARSs), which incorporate contextual information to achieve better recommendations, become a hot topic in the domain of recommender systems. Many context-aware recommendation methods have been proposed in the past decades. Some literatures provide survey of the research on CARSs. However, they mainly focus on context-aware recommendation methods and overlook the evaluation of them. The evaluation methods, evaluation properties and datasets of CARSs are different from those of traditional recommender systems where contexts are not considered. In this paper, we provide a review for evaluation of CARSs. We will introduce the basic concepts of CARSs, propose a new dataset partition method for each category of CARSs according to our classification of CARSs, summarize the evaluation method. Then we summarize the evaluation properties that CARSs pays attention to, which are different from the NCARSs. In addition, we also summarize the datasets specifically for CARSs, its applicable CARSs type and its evaluation dimensions and metrics. Based on our review, we draw some conclusions from evaluation perspective and point out future research directions.

AB Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, which means the model too closely fits the training data while performing poorly in the test data. Among various methods of coping with overfitting, dropout is one of the representative ways. From randomly dropping neurons to dropping neural structures, dropout has achieved great success in improving model performances. Although various dropout methods have been designed and widely applied in past years, their effectiveness, application scenarios, and contributions have not been comprehensively summarized and empirically compared by far. It is the right time to make a comprehensive survey. In this paper, we systematically review previous dropout methods and classify them into three major categories according to the stage where dropout operation is performed. Specifically, more than seventy dropout methods published in top AI conferences or journals (e.g., TKDE, KDD, TheWebConf, SIGIR) are involved. The designed taxonomy is easy to understand and capable of including new dropout methods. Then, we further discuss their application scenarios, connections, and contributions. To verify the effectiveness of distinct dropout methods, extensive experiments are conducted on recommendation scenarios with abundant heterogeneous information. Finally, we propose some open problems and potential research directions about dropout that worth to be further explored.

ID SETS
AB One of the major problems in real-life multiblock dynamic data analysis is that all the available modalities may not be relevant. Some of them may provide noisy or even inconsistent information with respect to other modalities. So, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of a new modality before considering it for feature extraction. In this regard, the paper introduces a new multiset canonical correlation analysis (MCCA), termed as incremental MCCA (IMCCA). When a new modality is available for the analysis, the IMCCA generates the new canonical variables from that of the earlier modalities, without repeating the same procedure with the original data augmented by the new modality. The proposed IMCCA deals with the "curse of dimensionality" problem associated with multidimensional data sets, by using the ridge regression optimization technique. Using the proposed IMCCA model, a new feature extraction algorithm is introduced, which considers a new modality for the analysis if it has relevant and significant information with respect to existing modalities. The proposed algorithm starts with the two most relevant modalities, and the remaining modalities are added sequentially according to their relevance. The optimum regularization parameters for the proposed algorithm are estimated based on the supervised information of sample categories. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, along with a comparison with state-of-the-art multimodal data integration methods, is established on several real-life multiblock data sets.

AB Due to the ubiquity of missing data, data imputation has received extensive attention in the past decades. It is a well-recognized problem impacting almost all fields of scientific study. Existing imputation algorithms differ in problem settings, model selection, and data evaluation. There is a lack of systematic comparison study among imputation algorithms. In this paper, we survey this interesting and evolving research topic by broadly reviewing and experimentally comparing the state-of-the-art missing data imputation algorithms. We analyze and categorize 19 imputation algorithms. Extensive experiments over 15 real-world benchmark datasets are conducted under various settings of data types, missing mechanisms, missing rates, dataset/model parameters, as well as the post-imputation prediction task. We shed light on a series of constructive insights on imputation algorithms to tackle imputation problem in real-life scenarios. Moreover, we put forward promising future directions for data imputation problem.

AB Many binary class datasets in real-life applications are affected by class imbalance problem. Data complexities like noise examples, class overlap and small disjuncts problems are observed to play a key role in producing poor classification performance. These complexities tend to exist in tandem with class imbalance problem. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a well-known method to re-balance the number of examples in imbalanced datasets. However, this technique cannot effectively tackle data complexities and it also has the capability of magnifying the degree of complexities. Also, the performance of the SMOTE is still not satisfactory. Therefore, various SMOTE variants have been proposed to overcome the downsides of SMOTE either by combining SMOTE with other algorithms or modifying the existing SMOTE algorithm. This paper aims to comparatively review the algorithms applied in SMOTE variants and investigate which data complexities are being addressed in what variants. Series of experiments are conducted on 24 binary class imbalanced datasets to observe the changes in the data complexity measures after SMOTE variants were applied in these datasets. The evaluation metrics like G-Mean and F1-Score are also analyzed to investigate the difference in classification performance between SMOTE variants.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Prediction over tabular data is often a crucial task in many real-life applications. Recent advances in deep learning give rise to various deep models for tabular data prediction. A common and essential step in these models is to vectorize raw input features in tabular data into dense embeddings. Choosing a suitable dimension for each feature is challenging yet necessary to improve model's performance and reduce memory cost of model parameters. Existing solutions to embedding dimensionality search always choose dimensions from a restricted candidate set. This restriction improves the search efficiency but would produce suboptimal embedding dimensions that hurt model's predictive performance. In this paper, we develop AutoSrh, a flexible embedding dimensionality search framework that can select varying dimensions for different features through differentiable optimization. The key idea of AutoSrh is to relax the search space to be continuous and optimize the selection of embedding dimensions via gradient descent. After optimization, AutoSrh performs embedding pruning to derive the mixed embedding dimensions and retrains the model to further improve the performance. Extensive experiments on five real-world tabular datasets demonstrate that AutoSrh can achieve better predictive performance than the existing approaches with 1.1 similar to 1.6x lower training time cost and reserve model's predictive performance while reducing 50 similar to 95% embedding parameters.

AB Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function. In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which only work as low-pass filters.

AB Extreme multi-label text classification (XMTC) aims to tag a text instance with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. XMTC has attracted much recent attention due to massive label sets yielded by modern applications, such as news annotation and product recommendation. The main challenges of XMTC are the data scalability and sparsity, thereby leading to two issues: i) the intractability to scale to the extreme label setting, ii) the presence of long-tailed label distribution, implying that a large fraction of labels have few positive training instances. To overcome these problems, we propose BGNN-XML, a scalable graph neural network framework tailored for XMTC problems. Specifically, we exploit label correlations via excavating their co-occurrence patterns and build a label graph based on the correlation matrix. We then conduct the attributed graph clustering by performing graph convolution with a low-pass graph filter to jointly model label dependencies and label features, which induces semantic label clusters. We further propose a bilateral-branch graph isomorphism network to decouple representation learning and classifier learning for better modeling tail labels. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that BGNN-XML significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable prediction efficiency and model size.

AB This article is on designing a compact data structure for multi-set membership testing that allows fast set querying. Multi-set membership testing is a fundamental operation for computing systems. Most existing schemes for multi-set membership testing are built upon Bloom filter and fall short in either storage space cost or query speed. To address this issue, we propose Noisy Bloom Filter (NBF), Error Corrected Noisy Bloom Filter (NBF-E), and Data-driven Noisy Bloom Filter (NBF-D) in this paper. We optimize their misclassification and false positive rates by theoretical analysis and present criteria for selection between NBF, NBF-E, and NBF-D. The key novelty of the three schemes is to store set ID information in a compact but noisy way that allows fast recording and querying and use a denoising method for querying. Especially, NBF-E incorporates asymmetric error-correcting coding techniques into NBF, and NBF-D encodes set ID basedt membership testing. on their cardinality. To evaluate NBF, NBF-E, and NBF-D in comparison with the prior art, we conducted experiments using real-world network traces. The results show that NBF, NBF-E, and NBF-D significantly advance the state-of-the-art on multi-se

TI Classification-Labeled Continuousization and Multi-Domain
   Spatio-Temporal Fusion for Fine-Grained Urban Crime Prediction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Spatiotemporal data mining; urban computing; deep learning
AB Fine-grained urban crime prediction is of great significance to urban management and public safety. Previous crime prediction work has been done at a relatively coarse time granularity, which may suffer from two issues for fine-grained crime prediction. 1) The zero-inflation problem associated with fine-grained granularity. Crime occurrence is sparse, and when the time granularity becomes finer, it leads to a more sparse prediction label for this problem resulting in the zero inflation problem. 2) Insufficient amount of information involved in crime datasets. When the spatio-temporal granularity becomes smaller, more information from related fields needs to be introduced to extract spatio-temporal features to assist the analysis. To address the first issue, we introduce a classification-labeled continuousization strategy and a weighted loss function for sparse classification problem, making the model more likely to focus on non-zero elements in zero-inflated datasets. For the second issue, we propose a novel deep learning based model, termed attention-based spatio-temporal multi-domain fusion network, which fuses features from multiple datasets in related domains. We evaluate our method on six real-world datasets collected in New York City and experiments on our model show the advantages beyond many competitive baselines.

AB Geospatial data provides a lot of benefits for personalized services. However, since the geospatial data contains sensitive information about personal activities, collecting the raw data has a potential risk of leaking private information from the collectors. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP), which protects the privacy of users without trusting the collector, has been adopted to preserve privacy in many real applications. In this paper, we investigate the problem of collecting the locations of individual users under LDP, and propose a perturbation mechanism designed carefully to minimize the expected error of perturbed locations according to the privacy budget and the data domain. The frequency distribution of perturbed locations inevitably has a large error. To tackle the problem, we also propose a postprocessing algorithm to estimate the original frequency distribution of collected data by using convex optimization. By experiments with various real datasets, we show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

   collection; riffle independent model; local differential privacy
AB With the deep penetration of the Internet and mobile devices, preference rankings are being collected on a massive scale by diverse data collectors for various business demands. However, users' preference rankings in many applications are highly sensitive. Without proper privacy protection mechanisms, it either puts individual privacy in jeopardy or hampers business opportunities due to users' unwillingness to share their true rankings. In this paper, we initiate the study of collecting preference rankings under local differential privacy. The key technical challenge comes from the fact that the number of possible rankings could be large in practical settings, leading to excessive injected noise. To solve this problem, we present a novel approach SAFARI, whose main idea is to collect a set of distributions over small domains which are carefully chosen based on the riffle independent (RI) model to approximate the overall distribution of users' rankings, and then generate a synthetic ranking dataset from the obtained distributions. By working on small domains instead of a large domain, SAFARI can significantly reduce the magnitude of added noise. In SAFARI, we design two transformation rules, namely Rule I and Rule II, to instruct users to transform their data to provide the information about the distributions of the small domains. In particular, we propose a method called LADE to precisely estimate the required distributions used for the structure learning of RI model. We also propose a new LDP method called SAFA for frequency estimation over multiple attributes that have small domains. We formally prove that SAFARI guarantees $\varepsilon$e-local differential privacy. Extensive experiments on real datasets confirm the effectiveness of SAFARI.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Phrase mining is an essential step when transforming unstructured text into structured information, in which the aim is to extract high-quality phrases from given corpora automatically. Existing statistics-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance on this task. However, such methods often rely heavily on statistical signals to extract quality phrases, ignoring the effect of contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware method, called ConPhrase, for quality phrase mining under distantly supervised settings. Specifically, ConPhrase formulates phrase mining as a sequence labeling problem by considering local contextual information, and also incorporates distant supervision methods to automatically generate labeled data. It comprises two modules designed to tackle global information scarcity and noisy data filtration: 1) a topic-aware phrase recognition network that incorporates domain-related topic information into word representation learning to identify quality phrases effectively; 2) an instance selection network that focuses on choosing correct sentences with reinforcement learning for improving the prediction performance of the phrase recognition network. Moreover, we also propose an extended variant of ConPhrase, called ConPhrase+, that further enhances phrase recognition by utilizing document-level contextual information across sentences within the entire document. Experimental results show that contextual information is indispensable for phrase mining and our context-aware methods perform significantly better than state-of-the-art approaches on three publicly available datasets.

AB Many applications rely on continual data collection to provide real-time information services, e.g., real-time road traffic forecasts. However, the collection of original data brings risks to user privacy. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as a private data collection framework for mass population. However, for continual data collection, existing LDP schemes, e.g., those employing the memoization technique, are known to have privacy leakage on data change points over time. In this paper, we propose a new scheme with stronger privacy guarantee for continual frequency estimation under LDP, namely, Dynamic Difference Report Mechanism (DDRM). In DDRM, we introduce difference trees to capture the data changes over time, which well addresses possible privacy leakage on data change points. As for the utility enhancement, DDRM exploits the common case of no data change in time series and thereby suppresses the consumption of privacy budget in such cases. Meanwhile, an optimal privacy budget allocation scheme is proposed to encourage users to report more data for better estimation accuracy. By both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluations, we show DDRM achieves highly accurate frequency estimation in real time.

TI Deep Cross-Modal Proxy Hashing

AB Due to the high retrieval efficiency and low storage cost for cross-modal search tasks, cross-modal hashing methods have attracted considerable attention from the researchers. For the supervised cross-modal hashing methods, how to make the learned hash codes sufficiently preserve semantic information contained in the label of datapoints is the key to further enhance the retrieval performance. Hence, almost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depend on defining similarities between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing model learning fully or partly. However, the defined similarity between datapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and misses abundant semantic information, which then hinders the further improvement of retrieval performance. Thus, in this paper, different from previous works, we propose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity between datapoints, called Deep Cross-modal Proxy Hashing (DCPH). Specifically, DCPH first trains a proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset into a semantic discriminative hash code, called proxy hash code. Each proxy hash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category well. Next, without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the training process of the modality-specific hashing networks, we propose a novel margin-dynamic-softmax loss to directly utilize the proxy hashing codes as supervised information. Finally, by minimizing the novel margin-dynamic-softmax loss, the modality-specific hashing networks can be trained to generate hash codes that can simultaneously preserve the cross-modal similarity and abundant semantic information well. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the cross-modal retrieval tasks.

AB Seeking an efficient solution for the problem of dynamic user preferences on social networks is challenging because the input data are short texts and user preferences usually change over time. This work proposes a novel framework that tackles these challenges based on deep neural networks and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. The framework consists of three primary phases: (1) learning the hidden space of user texts; (2) word generation and mass inference; and (3) mass combination and keyword extraction. In the first phase, user texts are grouped into small batches according to timestamps. Each batch is used for separately training two types of neural networks, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). In the second phase, the generators in the trained VAE and GAN work independently as two experts to generate bunches of tokens for modeling user preferences. Each bunch is considered as one piece of evidence, and is transformed into the so-called mass function in Dempster-Shafer theory by maximum a posterior estimation. In the final phase, Dempster's rule of combination is utilized for fusing the two independent pieces of evidence into an overall mass. This mass is used for extracting top keywords to form the user preferences within a specific time span. The experiments on short text datasets verified that the proposed method outperforms baseline models on many evaluation metrics. Additionally, the output of the proposed framework could be used for visualization, which is useful in many practical applications.

AB Time Series Classification (TSC) is a crucial area in machine learning. Although applications of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in this area have led to relatively good results, classifying this kind of data is a major challenge. This issue is due to the nature of time-series as it involves high data volume, unfavorable elements such as noise, inconsistency, and missing values. Shallow approaches solve these challenges using temporal discretization. Despite offering significant advantages, deep learning (DL) models do not apply temporal discretization in an end-to-end manner. This paper develops three end-to-end DL models, namely FCN-DISC, LSTM-FCN-DISC, and ALSTM-FCN-DISC, to integrate the benefits of temporal discretization and deep network architecture. The proposed models attempt to select the values of the input time-series that play a more effective role in model training by embedding temporal discretization in deep network architecture. These models use two loss functions to construct a discretized time series and optimize network weights. Thus, a new loss function for discretization was also introduced in addition to the cross-entropy. Experiments on univariate TSC datasets demonstrate that the proposed models, in most cases, outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

AB A cross join between two attribute sets holds on a relation whenever its projection onto the union of the attribute sets is the cross join between its projections on the first and second attribute set. Hence, the cross join is a fundamental operator on database relations. For example, it can rewrite the division operator into a simple projection, or measure the independence of tuple values between two attribute sets during cardinality estimation. It is therefore surprising that we present the first research on the discovery problem of cross joins. We show that the problem of deciding whether there is a cross join that holds on a given relation is not only NP-complete but W[3]-complete in its arguably most natural parameter, namely its arity. We establish the first algorithms that discover all cross joins that hold on a given relation. We illustrate in experiments with benchmark data that our algorithms perform well within the limits established by our hardness results. Our treatment of cross joins and the design of our algorithms enables us to extend our findings to the discovery of cross joins that meet a given approximation ratio. Our experiments quantify the trade-off between discovery time and targeted ratio.

AB Label noise and long-tailed distributions are two major challenges in distantly supervised relation extraction. Recent studies have shown great progress on denoising, but paid little attention to the problem of long-tailed relations. In this paper, we introduce a constraint graph to model the dependencies between relation labels. On top of that, we further propose a novel constraint graph-based relation extraction framework(CGRE) to handle the two challenges simultaneously. CGRE employs graph convolution networks to propagate information from data-rich relation nodes to data-poor relation nodes, and thus boosts the representation learning of long-tailed relations. To further improve the noise immunity, a constraint-aware attention module is designed in CGRE to integrate the constraint information. Extensive experimental results indicate that CGRE achieves significant improvements over the previous methods for both denoising and long-tailed relation extraction.

AB Influenced by the great success of deep learning via cloud computing and the rapid development of edge chips, research in artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted to both of the computing paradigms, i.e., cloud computing and edge computing. In recent years, we have witnessed significant progress in developing more advanced AI models on cloud servers that surpass traditional deep learning models owing to model innovations (e.g., Transformers, Pretrained families), explosion of training data and soaring computing capabilities. However, edge computing, especially edge and cloud collaborative computing, are still in its infancy to announce their success due to the resource-constrained IoT scenarios with very limited algorithms deployed. In this survey, we conduct a systematic review for both cloud and edge AI. Specifically, we are the first to set up the collaborative learning mechanism for cloud and edge modeling with a thorough review of the architectures that enable such mechanism. We also discuss potentials and practical experiences of some on-going advanced edge AI topics including pretraining models, graph neural networks and reinforcement learning. Finally, we discuss the promising directions and challenges in this field.

TI Efficient Multi-View K-Means Clustering With Multiple Anchor Graphs

DE Multi-view clustering; k-means; anchor graph; orthogonality
AB Multi-view clustering has attracted a lot of attention due to its ability to integrate information from distinct views, but how to improve efficiency is still a hot research topic. Anchor graph-based methods and k-means-based methods are two current popular efficient methods, however, both have limitations. Clustering on the derived anchor graph takes a while for anchor graph-based methods, and the efficiency of k-means-based methods drops significantly when the data dimension is large. To emphasize these issues, we developed an efficient multi-view k-means clustering method with multiple anchor graphs (EMKMC). It first constructs anchor graphs for each view and then integrates these anchor graphs using an improved k-means strategy to obtain sample categories without any extra post-processing. Since EMKMC combines the high-efficiency portions of anchor graph-based methods and k-means-based methods, its efficiency is substantially higher than current fast methods, especially when dealing with large-scale high-dimensional multi-view data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to other state-of-the-art methods, EMKMC can boost clustering efficiency by several to thousands of times while maintaining comparable or even exceeding clustering effectiveness.

DE Discrete collaborative filtering; efficient recommendation; explainable
   recommendation
AB Using hashing to learn the binary codes of users and items significantly improves the efficiency and reduces the space consumption of the recommender system. However, existing hashing-based recommender systems remain black boxes without any explainable outputs that illustrate why the system recommends the items. In this paper, we present a new end-to-end discrete recommendation framework based on the multi-task learning to simultaneously perform explainable and efficient recommendation. Toward this goal, an Explainable Discrete Collaborative Filtering (EDCF) method is proposed to preserve the user-item interaction features and semantic text features into binary hash codes by adaptively exploiting the correlations between the preference prediction task and the explanation generation task. At the online recommendation stage, EDCF makes efficient top-K recommendation by calculating the Hamming distances between the feature hash codes, and simultaneously generates natural language explanations for recommendation results through the explanation generation module. To obtain the hash codes directly from the end-to-end neural network, we introduce an attentive TextCNN and an Adaptive Tanh layer in the preference prediction task. For explanation generation, Long Short-Term Memory is employed to generate the explanations for recommendation results from the binary hash codes of user and item. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Graph neural network (GNN) has shown its prominent performance in representation learning of graphs but it has not been fully considered for heterogeneous graphs which contain more complex structures and rich semantics. The rich semantic information of heterogeneous graph can be usually revealed by meta-paths. Therefore, most of the existing GNN models designed for heterogeneous graphs utilize the meta-path based neighborhood sampler to divide a heterogeneous graph into multiple homogeneous subgraphs according to various meta-paths so that the homogeneous GNN can be applied to investigate heterogeneous graphs. Nevertheless, the way of embedding semantic information of meta-paths into multiple homogeneous graphs is implicit and ineffective, which cannot accurately capture the semantics of heterogeneous graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised GNN model named Explicit Message-Passing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (EMP), which executes the process of explicit message-passing along the meta-paths. Besides, we also propose a split method for meta-paths and consider mutual effect between various meta-paths in advance in the proposed model, so that the semantic information of the whole set of meta-paths can be captured accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model.

TI Fast Flexible Bipartite Graph Model for Co-Clustering

ID NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; INFORMATION
AB Co-clustering methods make use of the correlation between samples and attributes to explore the co-occurrence structure in data. These methods have played a significant role in gene expression analysis, image segmentation, and document clustering. In bipartite graph partition-based co-clustering methods, the relationship between samples and attributes is described by constructing a diagonal symmetric bipartite graph matrix, which is clustered by the philosophy of spectral clustering. However, this not only has high time complexity but also the same number of row and column clusters. In fact, the number of categories of rows and columns often changes in the real world. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel fast flexible bipartite graph model for the co-clustering method (FBGPC) that directly uses the original matrix to construct the bipartite graph. Then, it uses the inflation operation to partition the bipartite graph in order to learn the co-occurrence structure of the original data matrix based on the inherent relationship between bipartite graph partitioning and co-clustering. Finally, hierarchical clustering is used to obtain the clustering results according to the set relationship of the co-occurrence structure. Extensive empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposed model and verify the faster performance, generality, and flexibility of our model.

AB In decision-making systems, how to address uncertainty plays an important role for the improvement of system performance in uncertainty reasoning. Dempster-Shafer evidence (DSE) theory is an effective method to address uncertainty in decision-making problems by means of basic belief assignments (BBAs) and Dempster's combination rule. In the DSE theory, divergence measure between BBAs, which is beneficial for conflict information management in decision making, remains an open issue. In this paper, several generalized evidential divergences (EDs) are proposed and studied to measure the difference and discrepancy between BBAs in DSE theory, which have more universal applicability in decision theory. On this basis, a uniform BJS divergence-based decision-making algorithm is devised to improve the decision level. Furthermore, the extensions of weighted BJS to decision-making algorithms are discussed by considering not only subjective weights but also objective weights. Notably, this is the first work to propose the weighted BJS divergence in DSE theory providing a promising way to analyze decision-making problems from different perspectives. Besides, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods. Finally, the proposed BJS-based decision-making algorithm is applied to pattern classification. The results validate that the proposed decision making algorithm is beneficial for diverse real-world datasets and outperforms several well-known related works and demonstrates higher classification accuracy as well as robustness.

ID DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
AB Directional distribution analysis has long served as a fundamental functionality in abstracting dispersion and orientation of spatial datasets. Spatial datasets that describe sensitive information of individuals such as health status and home addresses must be used and shared cautiously to protect individuals' privacy. There is an inherent tension between the need of accurate directional distribution result and the requirement of individuals' location privacy. Plenty of excellent location privacy protection approaches such as geo-indistinguishability can provide strong protection for locations but considerably at the expense of statistical quality of subsequent directional distribution analysis. In this paper, to protect individual location data for directional distribution, we define the geographic feature of community with covariance matrix and then propose a geo-ellipse-indistinguishability privacy notion incorporating this covariance matrix. As an instantiation of metric differential privacy, geo-ellipse-indistinguishability guarantees pairwise inputs cannot be distinguishable with the level proportional to privacy budget and Mahalanobis distance between them, given a randomized output. We also present elliptical privacy mechanisms to achieve this privacy definition on the basis of gamma distribution and multivariate normal distribution. We finally evaluate the empirical utility of the proposed mechanism in New York home addresses database. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same privacy level, our proposed elliptical approach can achieve significantly higher directional distribution utility than circular noise function based method.

   learning
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) are popularly used to analyze non-euclidean graph data. Despite their successes, the design of graph neural networks requires heavy manual work and rich domain knowledge. Recently, neural architecture search algorithms are widely used to automatically design neural architectures for CNNs and RNNs. Inspired by the success of neural architecture search algorithms, we present a graph neural architecture search algorithm GraphNAS that enables automatic design of the best graph neural architecture based on reinforcement learning. Specifically, GraphNAS uses a recurrent network as the controller to generate variable-length strings that describe the architectures of graph neural networks, and trains the recurrent network with policy gradient to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation data set. Moreover, based on GraphNAS, we design a new GraphNAS++ model using distributed neural architecture search. Compared with GraphNAS that generates and evaluates only one candidate architecture at each iteration, GraphNAS++ generates a mini-batch of candidate architectures and evaluates them in a distributed computing environment until convergence. Experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphNAS can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of accuracy. Moreover, GraphNAS++ can speed up the design process at least five times by using the distributed training framework with GPUs.

AB Stock trend prediction is a hot issue in the Fintech field. Effective stock profiling is challenging due to highly non-stationary dynamics and complex interplays. Existing methods usually regard each stock independently or detect simplistic homogeneous structures. Practically, stock correlation originates from diverse aspects and underlying relationship signals are implicit in comprehensive graphs. Besides, RNNs are extensively used to simulate stock volatility while inadequate in capturing fine-granular patterns across local time snippets. To this end, in this paper we propose HATR-I, a Hierarchical Adaptive Temporal-Relational Interaction model to characterize and predict stock evolutions. Specifically, we grasp short- and long-term transition regularities of stock dynamics based on cascaded dilated convolutions and gating paths. By formulating different views of domain adjacency graphs into a unified multiplex network with edge attributes, we inject node- and semantic-level dual attention to refine the propagation of inter-stock collaborative information. Particularly, the stock pair matching is proceeding along each time-stage rather than until final compressed representations, meanwhile significant feature points and scales are identified considering the effect of time attenuation. Finally, we deduce latent shared clusters as global regularization to optimize the stock representations. Experiments on three real-world stock market datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

AB Network embedding - finding a low dimensional representation of the nodes with attributes in a hierarchical, directed network remains a challenging problem in the machine learning community. An emerging approach is to embed complex networks - networks of real-world systems - into hyperbolic space due to the fact that hyperbolic space can better naturally represent such a network's hierarchical structure. Existing hyperbolic embedding approaches, however, cannot handle the embedding of attributed directed networks to an arbitrary embedding dimension. To fill this gap, we introduce HEADNet, for Hyperbolic Embedding of Attributed Directed Networks, an algorithm based on extending previous works for embedding directed attributed networks to Gaussian distributions in hyperbolic space of arbitrary dimension. Through experimentation on a variety of both synthetic and real-world networks, we show that HEADNet can achieve competitive performance on common downstream machine learning tasks, including predicting directed links for previously unseen nodes. HEADNet provides an inductive hyperbolic embedding method for directed attributed networks, which opens the door to hyperbolic manifold learning on a wider range of real-world networks.

DE Graph neural network; hypergraph; noisy point clouds; three-dimensional
   (3D) detection
AB It is challenging to detect 3D objects from noise point clouds by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), though graph-based methods have shown promising results in 3D classifications. Since strong robustness against noise is offered by hypergraph, a relative paradigm named HyperGraph Construction-Compression-Conversion (HG3C) is proposed for detecting 3D objects from noise point clouds. Our method presents the capacity of reducing graph redundancy and capturing the variances from multiple features, by pre-encoding the graph, to improve the graph representations in point clouds. A fused graph neural network is further designed to predict the shape and category of the target in converted graphs. The experiments, on both the KITTI and Nuscene, show that the proposed approach achieves leading accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of using the hypergraph transformation to extract and compress point cloud information from noisy point clouds.

AB User engagement has recently received significant attention in understanding the decay and expansion of communities in many online social networking platforms. When a user chooses to leave a social networking platform, it may cause a cascading dropping out among her friends. In many scenarios, it would be a good idea to persuade critical users to stay active in the network and prevent such a cascade because critical users can have significant influence on user engagement of the whole network. Many user engagement studies have been conducted to find a set of critical (anchored) users in the static social network. However, social networks are highly dynamic and their structures are continuously evolving. In order to fully utilize the power of anchored users in evolving networks, existing studies have to mine multiple sets of anchored users at different times, which incurs an expensive computational cost. To better understand user engagement in evolving network, we target a new research problem called Anchored Vertex Tracking (AVT) in this article, aiming to track the anchored users at each timestamp of evolving networks. Nonetheless, it is nontrivial to handle the AVT problem which we have proved to be NP-hard. To address the challenge, we develop a greedy algorithm inspired by the previous anchored $k$k-core study in the static networks. Furthermore, we design an incremental algorithm to efficiently solve the AVT problem by utilizing the smoothness of the network structure's evolution. The extensive experiments conducted on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms and the effectiveness in solving the AVT problem.

AB Among a big body of recently developed algorithms for machine learning and data mining, a class of models using non-convex/non-smooth sparsity-inducing norms achieves promising results on many challenging tasks. An important problem faced with such models is to find an effective solution for the objective function with one or multiple intractable terms. Although a large number of optimization approaches have been developed, most of them are tailored to a specific model. Besides, these approaches generally introduce some additional parameters and no longer guarantee convergence. In this work, we first revisit some representative non-convex/non-smooth machine learning models, and then unity them into a generic formulation. Theoretically, we develop a simple yet efficient optimization framework, namely Iteratively Re-Weighted method (IRW), to solve such a class of models and provide the corresponding convergence analysis. Particularly, we validate our proposed method on two challenging machine learning tasks: multi-task regression and feature selection.

AB The accumulated massive job and employee data at various platforms such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor are very valuable for many online applications such as job/employee search and recommendations. In order to exploit these data, an interesting and practical problem is how to learn effective job and employee representations, which could be further utilized for many computing tasks such as searching for similar jobs and employees. Yet this problem is very challenging because these user-generated job and employee data are semi-structured and created without standards, which makes them very messy, sparse, and difficult to model. Developing novel and advanced methods to learn job and employee representations has become an urgent need. To this end, in this paper, we develop a novel neural network model for job and employee embeddings. Our proposed approach consists of three components to model career data from three levels of granularity: job content, job context, and job sequence. We fine-tune a transformer model to learn the semantics of massive text in job content, build a shallow neural network to accumulate contextual information in job sequences, and develop an RNN encoder-decoder model to learn representations of employees' career paths. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct two experimental tasks: job similarity and employee similarity searches. The experimental results with a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of the developed approach.

AB Molecular interaction prediction is essential in various applications including drug discovery and material science. The problem becomes quite challenging when the interaction is represented by unmapped relationships in molecular networks, namely molecular interaction, because it easily suffers from (i) insufficient labeled data with many false-positive samples, and (ii) ignoring a large number of biological entities with rich information in the knowledge graph. Most of the existing methods cannot properly exploit the information of knowledge graph and molecule graph simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a large-scale Knowledge Graph enhanced Multi-Task Learning model, namely KG-MTL, which extracts the features from both knowledge graph and molecular graph in a synergistic way. Moreover, we design an effective Shared Unit that helps the model to jointly preserve the semantic relations of drug entity and the neighbor structures of the compound in both knowledge graph and molecular graph. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed KG-MTL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two representative molecular interaction prediction tasks: drug-target interaction prediction and compound-protein interaction prediction. The source code of KG-MTL is available at https://github.com/xzenglab/KG-MTL.

AB Multi-view clustering aims to reveal the correlation between different input modalities in an unsupervised way. Similarity between data samples can be described by a similarity graph, which governs the quality of multi-view clustering. However, existing multi-view graph learning methods mainly construct similarity graph based on raw features, which are unreliable as real-world datasets usually contain noises, outliers, or even redundant information. In this paper, we formulate a novel model to simultaneously learn a robust structured similarity graph and perform multi-view clustering. The similarity graph is adaptively learned based on a latent representation that is invulnerable to noises and outliers. Furthermore, the similarity graph is enforced to contain a clear structure, i.e., the number of connected components of the target graph is exactly equal to the ground-truth class number. Consequently, the label to each data sample can be directly assigned without any postprocessing. As a result, our model aims at accomplishing three subtasks: latent representation extraction, similarity graph learning, and cluster label allocation, in a unified framework. These three subtasks are seamlessly integrated and can be mutually boosted by each other towards the overall optimal solution. An efficient alternation algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

AB Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL features of entities (e.g., prior probability, relatedness score, and entity embedding) are usually estimated based on Wikipedia. However, for newly emerging entities (EEs) which have just been discovered in news, they may still not be included in Wikipedia yet. As a consequence, it is unable to obtain required EL features for those EEs from Wikipedia and EL models will always fail to link ambiguous mentions with those EEs correctly as the absence of their EL features. To deal with this problem, in this paper we focus on a new task of learning EL features for emerging entities in a general way. We propose a novel approach called STAMO to learn high-quality EL features for EEs automatically, which needs just a small number of labeled documents for each EE collected from the Web, as it could further leverage the knowledge hidden in the unlabeled data. STAMO is mainly based on self-training, which makes it flexibly integrated with any EL feature or EL model, but also makes it easily suffer from the error reinforcement problem caused by the mislabeled data. Instead of some common self-training strategies that try to throw the mislabeled data away explicitly, we regard self-training as a multiple optimization process with respect to the EL features of EEs, and propose both intra-slot and inter-slot optimizations to alleviate the error reinforcement problem implicitly. We construct two EL datasets involving selected EEs to evaluate the quality of obtained EL features for EEs, and the experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other baseline methods of learning EL features.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great power in modeling graph structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs may make biased predictions w.r.t protected sensitive attributes, e.g., skin color and gender. This is because machine learning algorithms including GNNs are trained to reflect the distribution of the training data which often contains historical bias towards sensitive attributes. In addition, we empirically show that the discrimination in GNNs can be magnified by graph structures and the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. As a result, the applications of GNNs in high-stake domains such as crime rate prediction would be largely limited. Though extensive studies of fair classification have been conducted on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) data, methods to address the problem of discrimination on non-i.i.d data are rather limited. Generally, learning fair models require abundant sensitive attributes to regularize the model. However, for many graphs such as social networks, users are reluctant to share sensitive attributes. Thus, only limited sensitive attributes are available for fair GNN training in practice. Moreover, directly collecting and applying the sensitive attributes in fair model training may cause privacy issues, because the sensitive information can be leaked in data breach or attacks on the trained model. Therefore, we study a novel and important problem of learning fair GNNs with limited number of private sensitive attributes, i.e., sensitive attributes that are processed with a privacy-preserving mechanism. In an attempt to address these problems, FairGNN is proposed to eliminate the bias of GNNs whilst maintaining high node classification accuracy by leveraging graph structures and limited sensitive information. To further preserve the privacy, private sensitive attributes with privacy guarantee are obtained by injecting noise based on local differential privacy. And We further extend FairGNN to NT-FairGNN to handle the limited and private sensitive attributes to simultaneously achieve fairness and preserve privacy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FairGNN and NT-FairGNN in achieving fair and high-accurate classification.

AB Time-series and event sequences are widely collected data types in real-world applications. Modeling and forecasting of such temporal data play an important role in an informed decision-making process. A major limitation of previous methods is that they either focus on time-series or events, rather than the combination of the two worlds. In fact, the two types of data often provide complementary information, emphasizing the necessity of jointly modeling the both. In this paper, we propose the RNN-ODE collaborative model for joint modeling and forecasting of heterogeneous time-series and event sequence data, which combines several useful techniques from both Bayesian and deep learning for its interpretability. Specifically, we devise a tailored encoder to combine the advances in deep temporal point processes models and variational recurrent neural networks. To predict the probability of event occurrence over an arbitrary continuous-time horizon, we base our model on the mathematical foundation of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). Extensive experimental results on simulations and real data sets show that compared with existing methods, our integrated approach can achieve more competitive forecasting performance of both time-series and event sequences.

TI Link Prediction with Contextualized Self-Supervision

DE Link prediction; self-supervised learning; attributed networks
ID NETWORKS
AB Link prediction aims to infer the link existence between pairs of nodes in networks/graphs. Despite their wide application, the success of traditional link prediction algorithms is hindered by three major challenges-link sparsity, node attribute noise and dynamic changes-that are faced by many real-world networks. To address these challenges, we propose a Contextualized Self-Supervised Learning (CSSL) framework that fully exploits structural context prediction for link prediction. The proposed CSSL framework learns a link encoder to infer the link existence probability from paired node embeddings, which are constructed via a transformation on node attributes. To generate informative node embeddings for link prediction, structural context prediction is leveraged as a self-supervised learning task to boost the link prediction performance. Two types of structural context are investigated, i.e., context nodes collected from random walks versus context subgraphs. The CSSL framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner, with the learning of model parameters supervised by both the link prediction and self-supervised learning tasks. The proposed CSSL is a generic and flexible framework in the sense that it can handle both attributed and non-attributed networks, and operate under both transductive and inductive link prediction settings. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on seven real-world benchmark networks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed self-supervision based link prediction algorithm over state-of-the-art baselines, on different types of networks under both transductive and inductive settings. The proposed CSSL also yields competitive performance in terms of its robustness to node attribute noise and scalability over large-scale networks.

AB Processing large-scale data sets with limited labels has always been a difficult task in data mining. Facing this difficulty, two local feature selection algorithms, LARD and LRSD, have been proposed based on dependency degree, which can process partially labeled data sets and greatly improve the computational efficiency. However, it is very difficult for these algorithms to calculate large-scale data with millions of samples on a typical personal computer. Although the related family method is a more efficient approach than dependency degree, it cannot be used for partially labeled large-scale data. As a result, a local feature selection method based on related family is proposed to accelerate data processing in the paper. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can run 405 times faster than LARD on partially labeled data sets and maintain high classification accuracy. In addition, this new algorithm can effectively process partially labeled large-scale data sets with 5,000,000 samples or 20,000 features on a typical personal computer.

AB Crowd flow prediction, which aims to predict the in/out flows of different areas of a city, plays a critically important role in many real-world applications including intelligent transportation systems and public safety. The challenges of this problem lie in both the dynamic mobility patterns of crowds and the complex spatial-temporal correlations. Meanwhile, crowd flow is highly correlated to and affected by the Origin-Destination (OD) locations of the flow trajectories, which is largely ignored by existing works. In this paper, we study the novel problem of predicting the crowd flow and flow OD simultaneously, and propose a Multi-task Bayes-enhanced Adversarial Spatial Temporal Network entitled MBA-STNet to effectively address it. MBA-STNet adopts a shared-private framework which contains private spatial-temporal encoders, a shared spatial-temporal encoder, and decoders to learn the task-specific features and shared features. To effectively extract discriminative shared features, an adversarial loss on shared feature extraction is incorporated to reduce information redundancy. A Bayesian heterogeneous Spatio-temporal Attention Network is designed to learn the complex spatio-temporal correlations and alleviate the problem of data uncertainty. We also design an attentive temporal queue to capture the complex temporal dependency automatically without the help of domain knowledge.

AB The wide spread of fake news is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a single domain (e.g., politics). However, correlations exist commonly across multiple news domains, and thus it is promising to simultaneously detect fake news of multiple domains. Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in multi-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling incompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs one single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece. In this paper, we propose a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (M3 FEND) to address these two challenges. We model news pieces from a multi-view perspective, including semantics, emotion, and style. Specifically, we propose a Domain Memory Bank to enrich domain information which could discover potential domain labels based on seen news pieces and model domain characteristics. Then, with enriched domain information as input, a Domain Adapter could adaptively aggregate discriminative information from multiple views for news in various domains. Extensive offline experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of M3 FEND, and online tests verify its superiority in practice. Our code is available at https://github.com/ICTMCG/M3FEND.

AB As a fundamental structure in real-world networks, in addition to graph topology, communities can also be reflected by abundant node attributes. In attributed community detection, probabilistic generative models (PGMs) have become the mainstream method due to their principled characterization and competitive performances. Here, we propose a novel PGM without imposing any distributional assumptions on attributes, which is superior to the existing PGMs that require attributes to be categorical or Gaussian distributed. Based on the block model of graph structure, our model incorporates the attribute by describing its effect on node popularity. To characterize the effect quantitatively, we analyze the community detectability for our model and then establish the requirements of the node popularity term. This leads to a new scheme for the crucial model selection problem in choosing and solving attributed community detection models. With the model determined, an efficient algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters and to infer the communities. The proposed method is validated from two aspects. First, the effectiveness of our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed by the detectability condition. Second, extensive experiments indicate that our method not only outperforms the competing approaches on the employed datasets, but also shows better applicability to networks with various node attributes.

AB While self-supervised learning techniques are often used to mine hidden knowledge from unlabeled data via modeling multiple views, it is unclear how to perform effective representation learning in a complex and inconsistent context. To this end, we propose a new multi-view self-supervised learning method, namely consistency and complementarity network (CoCoNet), to comprehensively learn global inter-view consistent and local cross-view complementarity-preserving representations from multiple views. To capture crucial common knowledge which is implicitly shared among views, CoCoNet employs a global consistency module that aligns the probabilistic distribution of views by utilizing an efficient discrepancy metric based on the generalized sliced Wasserstein distance. To incorporate cross-view complementary information, CoCoNet proposes a heuristic complementarity-aware contrastive learning approach, which extracts a complementarity-factor jointing cross-view discriminative knowledge and uses it as the contrast to guide the learning of view-specific encoders. Theoretically, the superiority of CoCoNet is verified by our information-theoretical-based analyses. Empirically, our thorough experimental results show that CoCoNet outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods by a significant margin, for instance, CoCoNet beats the best benchmark method by an average margin of 1.1% on ImageNet.

AB As a key component of e-commerce computing, product representation learning (PRL) provides benefits for a variety of applications, including product matching, search, and categorization. The existing PRL approaches have poor language understanding ability due to their inability to capture contextualized semantics. In addition, the learned representations by existing methods are not easily transferable to new products. Inspired by the recent advance of pre-trained language models (PLMs), we make the attempt to adapt PLMs for PRL to mitigate the above issues. In this article, we develop KINDLE, a Knowledge-drIven pre-trainiNg framework for proDuct representation LEarning, which can preserve the contextual semantics and multi-faceted product knowledge robustly and flexibly. Specifically, we first extend traditional one-stage pre-training to a two-stage pre-training framework, and exploit a deliberate knowledge encoder to ensure a smooth knowledge fusion into PLM. In addition, we propose a multi-objective heterogeneous embedding method to represent thousands of knowledge elements. This helps KINDLE calibrate knowledge noise and sparsity automatically by replacing isolated classes as training targets in knowledge acquisition tasks. Furthermore, an input-aware gating network is proposed to select the most relevant knowledge for different downstream tasks. Finally, extensive experiments have demonstrated the advantages of KINDLE over the state-of-the-art baselines across three downstream tasks.

   representation learning
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful techniques in representation learning for graphs and have been increasingly deployed in a multitude of different applications that involve node- and graph-wise tasks. Most existing studies solve either the node-wise task or the graph-wise task independently while they are inherently correlated. This work proposes a unified model, AdamGNN, to interactively learn node and graph representations in a mutual-optimisation manner. Compared with existing GNN models and graph pooling methods, AdamGNN enhances the node representation with the learned multi-grained semantics and avoids losing node features and graph structure information during pooling. Specifically, a differentiable pooling operator is proposed to adaptively generate a multi-grained structure that involves meso- and macro-level semantic information in the graph. We also devise the unpooling operator and the flyback aggregator in AdamGNN to better leverage the multi-grained semantics to enhance node representations. The updated node representations can further adjust the graph representation in the next iteration. Experiments on 14 real-world graph datasets show that AdamGNN can significantly outperform 17 competing models on both node- and graph-wise tasks. The ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of AdamGNN's components, and the last empirical analysis further reveals the ingenious ability of AdamGNN in capturing long-range interactions.

TI Multi-Granularity Regularized Re-Balancing for Class Incremental
   Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Class hierarchy; class incremental learning; multi-granularity
   regularization; re-balancing modeling
AB Deep learning models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learning new tasks incrementally. Incremental learning has been proposed to retain the knowledge of old classes while learning to identify new classes. A typical approach is to use a few exemplars to avoid forgetting old knowledge. In such a scenario, data imbalance between old and new classes is a key issue that leads to performance degradation of the model. Several strategies have been designed to rectify the bias towards the new classes due to data imbalance. However, they heavily rely on the assumptions of the bias relation between old and new classes. Therefore, they are not suitable for complex real-world applications. In this study, we propose an assumption-agnostic method, Multi-Granularity Regularized re-Balancing (MGRB), to address this problem. Re-balancing methods are used to alleviate the influence of data imbalance; however, we empirically discover that they would under-fit new classes. To this end, we further design a novel multi-granularity regularization term that enables the model to consider the correlations of classes in addition to re-balancing the data. A class hierarchy is first constructed by ontology or grouping semantically or visually similar classes. The multi-granularity regularization then transforms the one-hot label vector into a continuous label distribution, which reflects the relations between the target class and other classes based on the constructed class hierarchy. Thus, the model can learn the inter-class relational information, which helps enhance the learning of both old and new classes. Experimental results on both public datasets and a real-world fault diagnosis dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/lilyht/CIL-MGRB.

AB In the face of high-dimensional and complex data, effective subspace can preserve specific statistical properties and provide an appropriate representation of data, which generally facilitates the underlying tasks such as clustering or classification. Meanwhile, multiple kernel learning is a technique to combine multiple kernels from different feature spaces effectively. Thus, by incorporating multiple kernels into the process of subspace learning, different feature spaces can be projected into a unified subspace. This article proposes the Multiple Kernel Subspace Learning (MKSL) for embedding the original space into a unified subspace. Multiple kernels of different feature spaces are combined by MKSL in the process of learning, which can extend the suitability for various applications. Moreover, to generate the optimal combination kernel of subspace learning, we propose a two-step iteration strategy to learn the appropriate kernel weights and transformation matrix of projecting simultaneously. Furthermore, our proposed formulation of MKSL can introduce different prior knowledge such as class information and neighborhood relationships. Thus it is competent to the unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and supervised learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse datasets, and the performances are comprehensively evaluated on different tasks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is outstanding in unsupervised clustering task and effective in supervised and semi-supervised classification tasks.

AB Naive Bayes (NB) continues to be one of the top 10 data mining algorithms due to its simplicity, efficiency and efficacy. Numerous enhancements have been proposed to weaken its attribute conditional independence assumption. However, all of them only focus on the raw attribute view, which is hard to reflect all the data characteristics in real-world applications. To portray data characteristics more comprehensively, in this study, we construct two label views from the raw attributes and propose a novel model called multi-view attribute weighted naive Bayes (MAWNB). In MAWNB, we first build multiple super-parent one-dependence estimators (SPODEs) as well as random trees (RTs), then we utilize each of them to classify each training instance in turn and use all their predicted class labels to construct two label views. Next, to avoid attribute redundancy, we optimize the weight of each attribute value for each class by minimizing the negative conditional log-likelihood (CLL) in each view. Finally, the estimated class-membership probabilities by three views are fused to predict the class label for each test instance. Extensive experiments show that MAWNB significantly outperforms NB and all the other existing state-of-the-art competitors.

AB We study the problem of Network Embedding (NE) for content-rich networks. NE models aim to learn efficient low-dimensional dense vectors for network vertices which are crucial to many network analysis tasks. The core problem of content-rich network embedding is to learn and integrate the semantic information conveyed by network structure and node content. In this paper, we propose a general end-to-end model, Dual GEnerative Network Embedding (DGENE), to leverage the complementary information of network structure and content. In this model, each vertex is regarded as an object with two modalities: node identity and textual content. Then we formulate two dual generation tasks, Node Identification (NI) which recognizes nodes' identities given their contents, and Content Generation (CG) which generates textual contents given the nodes' identities. We develop specific Content2Node and Node2Content models for the two tasks. Under the DGENE framework, the two dual models are learned by sharing and integrating intermediate layers. Extensive experimental results show that our model yields a significant performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art NE methods. Moreover, our model has an interesting and useful byproduct, that is, a component of our model can generate texts and nodes, which is potentially useful for many tasks.

   Bloom Filter
ID PERSISTENT
AB The fundamental issue of how to calculate the false positive probability of widely used Bloom Filters (BF), from which the conventional wisdom is to derive the optimal value of k, remains elusive. Since Bloom gave the false positive formula in 1970, in 2008, Bose et al. pointed out that Bloom's formula is flawed; and in 2010, Christensen et al. pointed out that Bose's formula is also flawed and gave another formula. Although Christensen's formula is perfectly accurate, it is time-consuming and impossible to calculate the optimal value of k. Based on the following observation: for a BF with m bits and n elements, if and only if its entropy is the largest, its false positive probability is the smallest, we propose the first approach to calculating the optimal k without any false positive formula. Furthermore, we propose a new and more accurate upper bound for the false positive probability. When the size of a Bloom Filter becomes infinitely large, our upper bound turns equal to the lower bound, which becomes Bloom's formula and deepens our understanding towards it. Besides, we derive the bounds of correct rate of Counting Bloom Filters (CBFs) by applying our proposed formulas about BFs to them.

ID ART
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive performance when testing and training graph data come from identical distribution. However, existing GNNs lack out-of-distribution generalization abilities so that their performance substantially degrades when there exist distribution shifts between testing and training graph data. To solve this problem, in this work, we propose an out-of-distribution generalized graph neural network (OOD-GNN) for achieving satisfactory performance on unseen testing graphs that have different distributions with training graphs. Our proposed OOD-GNN employs a novel nonlinear graph representation decorrelation method utilizing random Fourier features, which encourages the model to eliminate the statistical dependence between relevant and irrelevant graph representations through iteratively optimizing the sample graph weights and graph encoder. We further present a global weight estimator to learn weights for training graphs such that variables in graph representations are forced to be independent. The learned weights help the graph encoder to get rid of spurious correlations and, in turn, concentrate more on the true connection between learned discriminative graph representations and their ground-truth labels. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the out-of-distribution generalization abilities on two synthetic and 12 real-world datasets with distribution shifts. The results demonstrate that our proposed OOD-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Analytics over social graphs allows to extract valuable knowledge and insights for many fields like community detection, fraud detection, and interest mining. In practice, decentralized social graphs frequently arise, where the social graph is not available to a single entity and is decentralized among a large number of users, each holding only a limited local view about the whole graph. Collecting the local views for analytics of decentralized social graphs raises critical privacy concerns, as they encode private information about the social interactions among individuals. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate PrivGED, a new system aimed at privacy-preserving analytics over decentralized social graphs. PrivGED focuses on the support for eigendecomposition, one popular and fundamental graph analytics task producing eigenvalues/eigenvectors over the adjacency matrix of a social graph and benefits various practical applications. PrivGED is built from a delicate synergy of insights on graph analytics, lightweight cryptography, and differential privacy, allowing users to securely contribute their local views on a decentralized social graph for a cloud-based eigendecomposition analytics service while gaining strong privacy protection. Extensive experiments over real-world social graph datasets demonstrate that PrivGED achieves accuracy comparable to the plaintext domain, with practically affordable performance superior to prior art.

AB Concepts are building blocks of human thinking. For machines, concept understanding has also been increasingly important, which makes concept representation a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. While many concepts have their instances, the massive amount of information carried by instances has long been ignored in current concept representation, which limits the usage of these concepts in applications. In this paper, inspired by prototype theory in cognitive science, we propose prototypical concept representation for machines, which represents each concept with a distributed prototype derived from representations of its instances. For prototypical representation learning, we further introduce a novel model named Prototypical Siamese Network (PSN). PSN is trained under the supervision of isA determination, one of the most important concept-related applications. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, thus validating the effectiveness of prototypical concept representation.

TI Rank-r Discrete Matrix Factorization for Anchor Graph Clustering

ID ALGORITHMS
AB Considering many graph clustering methods are with quadratic or cubic time complexity and need post-processing to obtain the discrete solution. Combining with the anchor graph, we study a novel graph clustering model called Rank-$r$r Discrete Matrix Factorization (DMF-RR), which is linear time complexity, and motivated by nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Instead of constraining the factor matrices of NMF to be nonnegative as many existed methods, we constrain them to indicator matrices. Thus, DMF-RR can obtain the discrete solution by directly solving the original problem without post-processing. Furthermore, considering the greater similarity between samples of the same category, an anchor graph is constructed as an input to capture essential clustering structure by utilizing the duality information between samples and anchors. Subsequently, an efficient and simple algorithm is proposed due to the nature of indicator matrices. Extensive experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of DMF-RR.

AB Distance function is a main metrics of measuring the affinity between two data points in machine learning. Extant distance functions often provide unreachable distance values in real applications. This can lead to incorrect measure of the affinity between data points. This paper proposes a reachable distance function for KNN classification. The reachable distance function is not a geometric direct-line distance between two data points. It gives a consideration to the class attribute of a training dataset when measuring the affinity between data points. Concretely speaking, the reachable distance between data points includes their class center distance and real distance. Its shape looks like "Z," and we also call it a Z distance function. In this way, the affinity between data points in the same class is always stronger than that in different classes. Or, the intraclass data points are always closer than those interclass data points. We evaluated the reachable distance with experiments, and demonstrated that the proposed distance function achieved better performance in KNN classification.

TI Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Shared-Account Cross-Domain Sequential
   Recommendation

DE Cross-domain recommendation; reinforcement learning; sequential
   recommendation; shared-account recommendation
ID MODEL
AB Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (SCSR) is an emerging yet challenging task that simultaneously considers the shared-account and cross-domain characteristics in the sequential recommendation. Existing works on Shared-account Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (SCSR) are mainly based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) but they ignore the fact that although multiple users share a single account, it is mainly occupied by one user at a time. This observation motivates us to learn a more accurate user-specific account representation by attentively focusing on its recent behaviors. Furthermore, though existing works endow lower weights to irrelevant interactions, they may still dilute the domain information and impede the cross-domain recommendation. To address the above issues, we propose a reinforcement learning-based solution, namely RL-ISN, which consists of a basic cross-domain recommender and a reinforcement learning-based domain filter. Specifically, to model the account representation in the shared-account scenario, the basic recommender first clusters users' mixed behaviors as latent users, and then leverages an attention model over them to conduct user identification. To reduce the impact of irrelevant domain information, we formulate the domain filter as a hierarchical reinforcement learning task, where a high-level task is utilized to decide whether to revise the whole transferred sequence or not, and if it does, a low-level task is further performed to determine whether to remove each interaction within it or not. To evaluate the performance of our solution, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our RL-ISN method compared with the state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

DE Neural networks; time series classification; relationship features
ID FOREST; EEG
AB Time series classification has ubiquitous applications in the real world. Owing to its importance, many time series classification techniques have been proposed over years. Among them, neural network based methods have attracted significant research attention due to their ability to automatically extract latent and discriminative features from data. In this paper, we explore relationship features, which provide valuable global information for time series analytics, and propose a general neural network architecture, namely Rel-CNN, to learn both global and local subsequence features for time series classification. Moreover, we provide two detailed model designs, Relationship Feature based Convolution Filtering and Latent Relationship Feature based Convolution Filtering, and address technical issues due to excessive parameters to learn in these models. We evaluate our models and baselines on time series classification, with extensive experiments on the widely-used 85 uni-variate "bake-off" datasets and 8 multi-variate UEA datasets. Experimental results show that our Rel-CNN models are superior to the representative time series classifiers, in terms of average accuracy, average Macro-f1 and ranking metrics. In addition, an ensemble version of Rel-CNN also outperforms the state-of-the-art ensemble classifiers in terms of average rank, average accuracy and average Macro-f1 on the bake-off datasets.

AB In financial credit scoring, loan applications may be approved or rejected. We can only observe default/non-default labels for approved samples but have no observations for rejected samples, which leads to missing-not-at-random selection bias. Machine learning models trained on such biased data are inevitably unreliable. In this work, we find that the default/non-default classification task and the rejection/approval classification task are highly correlated, according to both real-world data study and theoretical analysis. Consequently, the learning of default/non-default can benefit from rejection/approval. Accordingly, we for the first time propose to model the biased credit scoring data with Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Specifically, we propose a novel Reject-aware Multi-Task Network (RMT-Net), which learns the task weights that control the information sharing from the rejection/approval task to the default/non-default task by a gating network based on rejection probabilities. RMT-Net leverages the relation between the two tasks that the larger the rejection probability, the more the default/non-default task needs to learn from the rejection/approval task. Furthermore, we extend RMT-Net to RMT-Net++ for modeling scenarios with multiple rejection/approval strategies. Extensive experiments are conducted on several datasets, and strongly verifies the effectiveness of RMT-Net on both approved and rejected samples. In addition, RMT-Net++ further improves RMT-Net's performances.

AB Relational databases are widely applied in various industries, such as government departments, medical institutions and enterprises, for data storage and relationship management. It is convenience to data maintenance, however, the data in it maybe vulnerable to be forged or tampered with. Therefore, protecting the copyright of relational databases is a critical issue. Fortunately, watermarking technology can be used to prove copyright ownership. Since the digital watermarking technology can solve this problem effectively, based on semantic, we propose two watermarking approaches with high security and strong robustness for numeric and non-numeric data of relational databases in this paper. On the one hand, we propose a reversible numeric watermarking approach. It performs the replacement operation at the semantic level and retain the statistical characteristics of the data. On the other hand, based on word segmentation and word embedding, the non-numerical attributes of the relational database with natural language are chosen to embed watermark. It is noteworthy that the proposed mechanism can be applied to both Chinese and English with minimum distortion. Additionally, we also propose the virtual splitting of attribute column and the principle of modification minimum to guarantee the capacity of watermark and reduce the data modification rate. Additionally, the BCH (31,16,7) error control code is added to the binary watermark string to improve the detection rate of watermark. Based on the above innovations, the security of watermarking algorithm is improved successfully by double encryption (chaos encryption and hash encryption) with two keys (the user's private key and the attribute column key). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two algorithms in this paper have stronger robustness on defensing malicious attacks than previous works.

AB The multi-view subspace clustering attracts much attention in recent years. Most methods follow the framework of fusing the affinity graph learned in each view. In this framework, both the fusion strategy and built graph of each view are very important. In this paper, we propose novel methods for multi-view subspace clustering to address these two aspects. On the one hand, we adopt the autoencoders with Laplacian regularization to construct the affinity graph in each view. Compared with previous work employing the autoencoders, the Laplacian term in our method can guide the learned latent representation favoring affinity extraction. Besides, we also discuss the reasons for adding Laplacian regularization. On the other hand, we propose a novel fusion strategy distinguished from the related literature. If the affinity graph of some view is not extracted well, the performance of previous fusion strategies will be seriously affected. Since our strategy can choose the best part from each affinity graph, it can overcome this limitation to some extent. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmark data sets confirm the effectiveness of our method.

AB Multi-view clustering is an important research topic due to its capability to utilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature learning for deep multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of some views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner, pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC outperforms 14 competitors including classic and state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/SubmissionsIn/SDMVC.

AB Multi-view clustering method tries to improve the performance of clustering by using the information existing in different views. The tensorial representation is more suitable to capture the high order correlations across different views while keep local geometrical structure in specific view. In this paper, we propose a sliced sparse gradient induced multi-view subspace clustering method via tensorial arctangent rank minimization, named SSG-TAR method. First, a tensorial arctangent rank (TAR) is defined, which is a tighter surrogate of the tensor rank and more effective to explore the consistency among multiple views. Second, a sliced sparse gradient regularization (SSG) is first proposed to enhance the discrimination between clusters and better capture the complementary information in view-specific feature space. Finally, we unify these two terms together and establish an efficient algorithm to optimize the proposed model. Furthermore, the constructed sequence was proved to converge to the stationary KKT point. We have carried out extensive experiments on ten datasets across different types and sizes to verify the performance of our model. The experimental results show that our method have achieved the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Through the application of process mining, organisations can improve their business processes by leveraging data recorded as a result of the performance of these processes. Over the past two decades, the field of process mining evolved considerably, offering a rich collection of analysis techniques with different objectives and characteristics. Despite the advances in this field, a solid statistical foundation is still lacking. Such a foundation would allow analysis outcomes to be found or judged using the notion of statistical significance, thus providing a more objective way to assess these outcomes. This article contributes several statistical tests and association measures that treat process behaviour as a variable. The sensitivity of these tests to their parameters is evaluated and their applicability is illustrated through the use of real-life event logs. The presented tests and measures constitute a key contribution to a statistical foundation for process mining.

AB Recently, forecasting the crowd flows has become an important research topic, and plentiful technologies have achieved good performances. As we all know, the flow at a citywide level is in a mixed state with several basic patterns (e.g., commuting, working, and commercial) caused by the city area functional distributions (e.g., developed commercial areas, educational areas and parks). However, existing technologies have been criticized for their lack of considering the differences in the flow patterns among regions since they want to build only one comprehensive model to learn the mixed flow tensors. Recognizing this limitation, we present a new perspective on flow prediction and propose an explainable framework named ST-ExpertNet, which can adopt every spatial-temporal model and train a set of functional experts devoted to specific flow patterns. Technically, we train a bunch of experts based on the Mixture of Experts (MoE), which guides each expert to specialize in different kinds of flow patterns in sample spaces by using the gating network. We define several criteria, including comprehensiveness, sparsity, and preciseness, to construct the experts for better interpretability and performances. We conduct experiments on a wide range of real-world taxi and bike datasets in Beijing and NYC. The visualizations of the expert's intermediate results demonstrate that our ST-ExpertNet successfully disentangles the city's mixed flow tensors along with the city layout, e.g., the urban ring road structure. Different network architectures, such as ST-ResNet, ConvLSTM, and CNN, have been adopted into our ST-ExpertNet framework for experiments and the results demonstrates the superiority of our framework in both interpretability and performances.

TI STP-TrellisNets plus : Spatial-Temporal Parallel TrellisNets for

DT Article
DE Metro station passenger flow; multi-step prediction; TrellisNet;
   encoder-decoder; diffusion graph convolution
AB The drastic increase of metro passengers in recent years inevitably causes the overcrowdedness in the metro systems. Accurately predicting passenger flows at metro stations is critical for efficient metro system management, which helps alleviate such overcrowdedness. Compared to the prevalent next-step prediction, multi-step passenger flow prediction could prominently increase the prediction duration and reveal finer-grained passenger flow variations, which better helps metro system management. Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of multi-step metro station passenger (MSP) flow prediction. In light of MSP flows' unique spatial-temporal characteristics, we propose STP-TrellisNets+, which for the first time augments the newly-emerged temporal convolutional framework TrellisNet for multi-step MSP flow prediction. The temporal module of STP-TrellisNets+ (named CP-TrellisNetsED) employs a Closeness TrellisNet followed by a Periodicity TrellisNets-based Encoder-Decoder (P-TrellisNetsED) to jointly capture the short- and long-term temporal correlation of MSP flows. In parallel to CP-TrellisNetsED, its spatial module (named GC-TrellisNetsED) adopts a novel transfer flow-based metric to characterize the spatial correlation among MSP flows, and implements another TrellisNetsED on multiple diffusion graph convolutional networks (DGCNs) in time-series order to capture the dynamics of such spatial correlation. Extensive experiments with two large-scale real-world automated fare collection datasets demonstrate that STP-TrellisNets+ outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Finding tampered regions in images is a common research topic in machine learning and computer vision. Although many image manipulation location algorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on RGB images with different color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the potential tampering clues is often ignored. Moreover, among the manipulation operations, splicing and copy-move are two frequently used methods, but as their characteristics are quite different, specific methods have been individually designed for detecting the operations of either splicing or copy-move, and it is very difficult to widely apply these methods in practice. To solve these issues, in this work, a novel end-to-end two-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for generic image manipulation localization where the RGB stream, the frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework. Specifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to adaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and eliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive cross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB feature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location network (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the parameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are further fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly optimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The results of the extensive experiments performed on six public benchmarks of the image manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, In-The-Wild, NIST-16, and IMD-2020, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can substantially outperform state-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of MCC, F1, and AUC while maintaining robustness with respect to various attacks. Compared with DeepLabV3+ on the CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, In-The-Wild, and NIST-16 datasets, the improvements in MCC/F1 reach 11%/11.1%, 8.2%/10.3%, 10.2%/11.6%, 8.9%/6.2%, and 13.3%/16.0%, respectively. Moreover, when IMD2020 is utilized, its AUC improvement can achieve 14.7%.

AB Clinical risk prediction based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) can assist doctors in better judgment and can make sense of early diagnosis. However, the prediction performance heavily relies on effective representations from multi-dimensional time-series EHR data. Existing solutions usually focus on temporal features or inherent relations between clinical event variables or extract both information in two separate phases. This usually leads to insufficient patient feature information and results in poor prediction performance. Moreover, existing methods based on Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network usually require manual selection of proper Meta-Paths. To solve these problems, we propose the Time-aware Context-Gated Graph Attention Network (T-ContextGGAN). Specifically, we design a GNN based module with Time-aware Meta-Paths and self-attention mechanism to extract both temporal semantic information and inherent relations of EHR data simultaneously and perform automatic Meta-Path selection. To evaluate the proposed model, we extract the first 48 hour EHR data in the first Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission of three different tasks from two open-source datasets and model various clinical variables on the proposed EHRGraph. Extensive experimental results show the proposed model can effectively extract informative features, and outperform existing state-of-art models in terms of various prediction measures. Our code is available in https://github.com/OwlCitizen/TContext-GGAN.

AB Besides entity-centric knowledge, usually organized as Knowledge Graph (KG), events are also an essential kind of knowledge in the world, which trigger the spring up of event-centric knowledge representation form like Event KG (EKG). It plays an increasingly important role in many downstream applications, such as search, question-answering, recommendation, financial quantitative investments, and text generation. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of EKG from history, ontology, instance, and application views. Specifically, to characterize EKG thoroughly, we focus on its history, definition, schema induction, acquisition, related representative graphs/systems, and applications. The development processes and trends are studied therein. We further summarize prospective directions to facilitate future research on EKG.

AB Recently, aligning users among different social networks has received significant attention. However, most of the existing studies do not consider users' behavior information during the aligning procedure and thus still suffer from poor learning performance. In fact, we observe that social network alignment and user behavior analysis can benefit from each other. Motivated by such an observation, we propose to jointly study the social network alignment and user behavior analysis problem in this paper. We design a novel framework named BANANA-RGB. In this framework, to capture users' multi-scale behavior information in each social network, we train a variant of the hierarchical periodic memory network with personalized memorization. To leverage behavior analysis for social network alignment, we design a tensor fusion network-based alignment component to improve the performance. To further leverage social network alignment for behavior analysis, we design a gating-based cross-network behavior fusion component to integrate users' behavior information in different social networks based on the alignment result. We iteratively train the above two components to make the two tasks benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recently, fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) of different satellites has become an effective way to improve the resolution of an HSI. However, due to different imaging satellites, different illumination, and adjacent imaging time, the LR-HSI and HR-MSI may not satisfy the observation models established by existing works, and the LR-HSI and HR-MSI are hard to be registered. To solve the above problems, we establish new observation models for LR-HSIs and HR-MSIs from different satellites, then a deep-learning-based framework is proposed to solve the key steps in multi-satellite HSI fusion, including image registration, blur kernel learning, and image fusion. Specifically, we first construct a convolutional neural network (CNN), called RegNet, to produce pixel-wise offsets between LR-HSI and HR-MSI, which are utilized to register the LR-HSI. Next, according to the new observation models, a tiny network, called BKLNet, is built to learn the spectral and spatial blur kernels, where the BKLNet and RegNet can be trained jointly. In the fusion part, we further train a FusNet by downsampling the registered data with the learned spatial blur kernel. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in HSI registration and fusion accuracy.

AB Neural architecture search (NAS) can automatically discover well-performing architectures in a large search space and has been shown to bring improvements to various applications. However, the computational burden of NAS is huge, since exploring a large search space can need evaluating more than thousands of architecture samples. To improve the sample efficiency of search space exploration, predictor-based NAS methods learn a performance predictor of architectures, and utilize the predictor to sample worth-evaluating architectures. The encoding scheme of NN architectures is crucial to the predictor's generalization ability, and thus crucial to the efficacy of the NAS process. To this end, we have designed a generic Graph-based neural ArchiTecture Encoding Scheme (GATES), a more reasonable modeling of NN architectures that mimics their data processing. Nevertheless, GATES is unaware of the concrete computing semantic of NN operations or architectures. Thus, the learning of operation embeddings and weights in GATES can only exploit the information in architectures-performance pairs. We propose GATES++, which incorporates multifaceted information about NN's operation-level and architecture-level computing semantics into its construction and training, respectively. Experiments on benchmark search spaces show that both the operation-level and architecture-level information can bring improvements alone, and GATES++ can discover better architectures after evaluating the same number of architectures.

AB Neural chat translation (NCT) aims to translate a cross-lingual chat between speakers of different languages. Existing context-aware NMT models cannot achieve satisfactory performances due to the following inherent problems: 1) limited resources of annotated bilingual dialogues; 2) the neglect of modelling conversational properties; 3) training discrepancy between different stages. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-task multi-stage transitional (MMT) training framework, where an NCT model is trained using the bilingual chat translation dataset and additional monolingual dialogues. We elaborately design two auxiliary tasks, namely utterance discrimination and speaker discrimination, to introduce the modelling of dialogue coherence and speaker characteristic into the NCT model. The training process consists of three stages: 1) sentence-level pre-training on large-scale parallel corpus; 2) intermediate training with auxiliary tasks using additional monolingual dialogues; 3) context-aware fine-tuning with gradual transition. Particularly, the second stage serves as an intermediate phase that alleviates the training discrepancy between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Moreover, to make the stage transition smoother, we train the NCT model using a gradual transition strategy, i.e., gradually transiting from using monolingual to bilingual dialogues. Extensive experiments on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed training framework.

AB Registration is a basic yet crucial task in point cloud processing. In correspondence-based point cloud registration, matching correspondences by point feature techniques may lead to an extremely high outlier (false correspondence) ratio. Current outlier removal methods still suffer from low efficiency, accuracy, and recall rate. We use an intuitive method to describe the 6-DOF (degree of freedom) curtailment process in point cloud registration and propose an outlier removal strategy based on the reliability of the correspondence graph. The method constructs the corresponding graph according to the given correspondences and designs the concept of the reliability degree of the graph node for optimal candidate selection and the reliability degree of the graph edge to obtain the global maximum consensus set. The presented method achieves fast and accurate outliers removal along with gradual aligning parameters estimation. Extensive experiments on simulations and challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can still perform effective point cloud registration even the correspondence outlier ratio is over 99%, and the efficiency is better than the state-of-the-art. Code is available at https://github.com/WPC-WHU/GROR.

ID OBJECT DETECTION
AB Compared with current RGB or RGB-D saliency detection datasets, those for light field saliency detection often suffer from many defects, e.g., insufficient data amount and diversity, incomplete data formats, and rough annotations, thus impeding the prosperity of this field. To settle these issues, we elaborately build a large-scale light field dataset, dubbed PKU-LF, comprising 5,000 light fields and covering diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. Our PKU-LF provides all-inclusive representation formats of light fields and offers a unified platform for comparing algorithms utilizing different input formats. For sparking new vitality in saliency detection tasks, we present many unexplored scenarios (such as underwater and high-resolution scenes) and the richest annotations (such as scribble annotations, bounding boxes, object-/instance-level annotations, and edge annotations), on which many potential attention modeling tasks can be investigated. To facilitate the development of saliency detection, we systematically evaluate and analyze 16 representative 2D, 3D, and 4D methods on four existing datasets and the proposed dataset, furnishing a thorough benchmark. Furthermore, tailored to the distinct structural characteristics of light fields, a novel symmetric two-stream architecture (STSA) network is proposed to predict the saliency of light fields more accurately. Specifically, our STSA incorporates a focalness interweavement module (FIM) and three partial decoder modules (PDM). The former is designed to efficiently establish long-range dependencies across focal slices, while the latter aims to effectively aggregate the extracted coadjutant features in a mutual-enhancement way. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform the competitors.

AB Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) in computer vision are primarily comparative, whose goal is to preserve invariant and discriminative semantics in latent representations by comparing siamese image views. However, the preserved high-level semantics do not contain enough local information, which is vital in medical image analysis (e.g., image-based diagnosis and tumor segmentation). To mitigate the locality problem of comparative SSL, we propose to incorporate the task of pixel restoration for explicitly encoding more pixel-level information into high-level semantics. We also address the preservation of scale information, a powerful tool in aiding image understanding but has not drawn much attention in SSL. The resulting framework can be formulated as a multi-task optimization problem on the feature pyramid. Specifically, we conduct multi-scale pixel restoration and siamese feature comparison in the pyramid. In addition, we propose non-skip U-Net to build the feature pyramid and develop sub-crop to replace multi-crop in 3D medical imaging. The proposed unified SSL framework (PCRLv2) surpasses its self-supervised counterparts on various tasks, including brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2018), chest pathology identification (ChestX-ray, CheXpert), pulmonary nodule detection (LUNA), and abdominal organ segmentation (LiTS), sometimes outperforming them by large margins with limited annotations. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/RL4M/PCRLv2.

AB Partially labeled data learning (PLDL), including partial label learning (PLL) and partial multi-label learning (PML), has been widely used in nowadays data science. Researchers attempt to construct different specific models to deal with the different classification tasks for PLL and PML scenarios respectively. The main challenge in training classifiers for PLL and PML is how to deal with ambiguities caused by the noisy false-positive labels in the candidate label set. The state-of-the-art strategy for both scenarios is to perform disambiguation by identifying the ground-truth label(s) directly from the candidate label set, which can be summarized into two categories: 'the identifying method' and 'the embedding method'. However, both kinds of methods are constructed by hand-designed heuristic modeling under considerations like feature/label correlations with no theoretical interpretation. Instead of adopting heuristic or specific modeling, we propose a novel unifying framework called A Unifying Probabilistic Framework for Partially Labeled Data Learning (UPF-PLDL), which is derived from a clear probabilistic formulation, and brings existing research on PLL and PML under one theoretical interpretation with respect to information theory. Furthermore, the proposed UPF-PLDL also unifies 'the identifying method' and 'the embedding method' into one integrated framework, which naturally incorporates the feature and label correlation considerations. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets for both PLL and PML scenarios clearly demonstrate the superiorities of the derived framework.

AB In this article, we provide an intuitive viewing to simplify the Siamese-based trackers by converting the tracking task to a classification. Under this viewing, we perform an in-depth analysis for them through visual simulations and real tracking examples, and find that the failure cases in some challenging situations can be regarded as the issue of missing decisive samples in offline training. Since the samples in the initial (first) frame contain rich sequence-specific information, we can regard them as the decisive samples to represent the whole sequence. To quickly adapt the base model to new scenes, a compact latent network is presented via fully using these decisive samples. Specifically, we present a statistics-based compact latent feature for fast adjustment by efficiently extracting the sequence-specific information. Furthermore, a new diverse sample mining strategy is designed for training to further improve the discrimination ability of the proposed compact latent network. Finally, a conditional updating strategy is proposed to efficiently update the basic models to handle scene variation during the tracking phase. To evaluate the generalization ability and effectiveness and of our method, we apply it to adjust three classical Siamese-based trackers, namely SiamRPN++, SiamFC, and SiamBAN. Extensive experimental results on six recent datasets demonstrate that all three adjusted trackers obtain the superior performance in terms of the accuracy, while having high running speed.

AB While graph representation learning methods have shown success in various graph mining tasks, what knowledge is exploited for predictions is less discussed. This paper proposes a novel Adaptive Subgraph Neural Network named AdaSNN to find critical structures in graph data, i.e., subgraphs that are dominant to the prediction results. To detect critical subgraphs of arbitrary size and shape in the absence of explicit subgraph-level annotations, AdaSNN designs a Reinforced Subgraph Detection Module to search subgraphs adaptively without heuristic assumptions or predefined rules. To encourage the subgraph to be predictive at the global scale, we design a Bi-Level Mutual Information Enhancement Mechanism including both global-aware and label-aware mutual information maximization to further enhance the subgraph representations in the perspective of information theory. By mining critical subgraphs that reflect the intrinsic property of a graph, AdaSNN can provide sufficient interpretability to the learned results. Comprehensive experimental results on seven typical graph datasets demonstrate that AdaSNN has a significant and consistent performance improvement and provides insightful results.

AB Natural science datasets frequently violate assumptions of independence. Samples may be clustered (e.g., by study site, subject, or experimental batch), leading to spurious associations, poor model fitting, and confounded analyses. While largely unaddressed in deep learning, this problem has been handled in the statistics community through mixed effects models, which separate cluster-invariant fixed effects from cluster-specific random effects. We propose a general-purpose framework for Adversarially-Regularized Mixed Effects Deep learning (ARMED) models through non-intrusive additions to existing neural networks: 1) an adversarial classifier constraining the original model to learn only cluster-invariant features, 2) a random effects subnetwork capturing cluster-specific features, and 3) an approach to apply random effects to clusters unseen during training. We apply ARMED to dense, convolutional, and autoencoder neural networks on 4 datasets including simulated nonlinear data, dementia prognosis and diagnosis, and live-cell image analysis. Compared to prior techniques, ARMED models better distinguish confounded from true associations in simulations and learn more biologically plausible features in clinical applications. They can also quantify inter-cluster variance and visualize cluster effects in data. Finally, ARMED matches or improves performance on data from clusters seen during training (5-28% relative improvement) and generalization to unseen clusters (2-9% relative improvement) versus conventional models.

AB Supervised deep learning has achieved tremendous success in many computer vision tasks, which however is prone to overfit noisy labels. To mitigate the undesirable influence of noisy labels, robust loss functions offer a feasible approach to achieve noise-tolerant learning. In this work, we systematically study the problem of noise-tolerant learning with respect to both classification and regression. Specifically, we propose a new class of loss function, namely asymmetric loss functions (ALFs), which are tailored to satisfy the Bayes-optimal condition and thus are robust to noisy labels. For classification, we investigate general theoretical properties of ALFs on categorical noisy labels, and introduce the asymmetry ratio to measure the asymmetry of a loss function. We extend several commonly-used loss functions, and establish the necessary and sufficient conditions to make them asymmetric and thus noise-tolerant. For regression, we extend the concept of noise-tolerant learning for image restoration with continuous noisy labels. We theoretically prove that l(p) loss (p > 0) is noise-tolerant for targets with the additive white Gaussian noise. For targets with general noise, we introduce two losses as surrogates of l(0) loss that seeks the mode when clean pixels keep dominant. Experimental results demonstrate that ALFs can achieve better or comparative performance compared with the state-of-the-arts. The source code of our method is available at: https://github.com/hitcszx/ALFs.

AB Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) and boosting are two popular ensemble learning approaches, which combine multiple base learners to generate a composite model for more accurate and more reliable performance. They have been widely used in biology, engineering, healthcare, etc. This article proposes BoostForest, which is an ensemble learning approach using BoostTree as base learners and can be used for both classification and regression. BoostTree constructs a tree model by gradient boosting. It increases the randomness (diversity) by drawing the cut-points randomly at node splitting. BoostForest further increases the randomness by bootstrapping the training data in constructing different BoostTrees. BoostForest generally outperformed four classical ensemble learning approaches (Random Forest, Extra-Trees, XGBoost and LightGBM) on 35 classification and regression datasets. Remarkably, BoostForest tunes its parameters by simply sampling them randomly from a parameter pool, which can be easily specified, and its ensemble learning framework can also be used to combine many other base learners.

AB High-speed imaging can help us understand some phenomena that are too fast to be captured by our eyes. Although ultra-fast frame-based cameras (e.g., Phantom) can record millions of fps at reduced resolution, they are too expensive to be widely used. Recently, a retina-inspired vision sensor, spiking camera, has been developed to record external information at 40, 000 Hz. The spiking camera uses the asynchronous binary spike streams to represent visual information. Despite this, how to reconstruct dynamic scenes from asynchronous spikes remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce novel high-speed image reconstruction models based on the short-term plasticity (STP) mechanism of the brain, termed TFSTP and TFMDSTP. We first derive the relationship between states of STP and spike patterns. Then, in TFSTP, by setting up the STP model at each pixel, the scene radiance can be inferred by the states of the models. In TFMDSTP, we use the STP to distinguish the moving and stationary regions, and then use two sets of STP models to reconstruct them respectively. In addition, we present a strategy for correcting error spikes. Experimental results show that the STP-based reconstruction methods can effectively reduce noise with less computing time, and achieve the best performances on both real-world and simulated datasets.

AB This article focuses on conditional generative modeling (CGM) for image data with continuous, scalar conditions (termed regression labels). We propose the first model for this task which is called continuous conditional generative adversarial network (CcGAN). Existing conditional GANs (cGANs) are mainly designed for categorical conditions (e.g., class labels). Conditioning on regression labels is mathematically distinct and raises two fundamental problems: (P1) since there may be very few (even zero) real images for some regression labels, minimizing existing empirical versions of cGAN losses (a.k.a. empirical cGAN losses) often fails in practice; and (P2) since regression labels are scalar and infinitely many, conventional label input mechanisms (e.g., combining a hidden map of the generator/discriminator with a one-hot encoded label) are not applicable. We solve these problems by: (S1) reformulating existing empirical cGAN losses to be appropriate for the continuous scenario; and (S2) proposing a naive label input (NLI) mechanism and an improved label input (ILI) mechanism to incorporate regression labels into the generator and the discriminator. The reformulation in (S1) leads to two novel empirical discriminator losses, termed the hard vicinal discriminator loss (HVDL) and the soft vicinal discriminator loss (SVDL) respectively, and a novel empirical generator loss. Hence, we propose four versions of CcGAN employing different proposed losses and label input mechanisms. The error bounds of the discriminator trained with HVDL and SVDL, respectively, are derived under mild assumptions. To evaluate the performance of CcGANs, two new benchmark datasets (RC-49 and Cell-200) are created. A novel evaluation metric (Sliding Frechet Inception Distance) is also proposed to replace Intra-FID when Intra-FID is not applicable. Our extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets (i.e., RC-49, UTKFace, Cell-200, and Steering Angle with both low and high resolutions) support the following findings: the proposed CcGAN is able to generate diverse, high-quality samples from the image distribution conditional on a given regression label; and CcGAN substantially outperforms cGAN both visually and quantitatively.

AB Despite advances in feature representation, leveraging geometric relations is crucial for establishing reliable visual correspondences under large variations of images. In this work we introduce a Hough transform perspective on convolutional matching and propose an effective geometric matching algorithm, dubbed Convolutional Hough Matching (CHM). The method distributes similarities of candidate matches over a geometric transformation space and evaluates them in a convolutional manner. We cast it into a trainable neural layer with a semi-isotropic high-dimensional kernel, which learns non-rigid matching with a small number of interpretable parameters. To further improve the efficiency of high-dimensional voting, we also propose to use an efficient kernel decomposition with center-pivot neighbors, which significantly sparsifies the proposed semi-isotropic kernels without performance degradation. To validate the proposed techniques, we develop the neural network with CHM layers that perform convolutional matching in the space of translation and scaling. Our method sets a new state of the art on standard benchmarks for semantic visual correspondence, proving its strong robustness to challenging intra-class variations.

AB Attention-based neural networks, such as Transformers, have become ubiquitous in numerous applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. In all kinds of attention networks, the attention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input tokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning based on representations, wherein the attention maps of different layers are learned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the evolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual convolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the attention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a residual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token relationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an evolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it is beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this process. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced evolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various applications, including time-series representation, natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on time-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated Convolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best SOTA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork that explicitly models the layer-wise evolution of attention maps. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/pkuyym/EvolvingAttention.

AB Co-salient object detection (Co-SOD) aims at discovering the common objects in a group of relevant images. Mining a co-representation is essential for locating co-salient objects. Unfortunately, the current Co-SOD method does not pay enough attention that the information not related to the co-salient object is included in the co-representation. Such irrelevant information in the co-representation interferes with its locating of co-salient objects. In this paper, we propose a Co-Representation Purification (CoRP) method aiming at searching noise-free co-representation. We search a few pixel-wise embeddings probably belonging to co-salient regions. These embeddings constitute our co-representation and guide our prediction. For obtaining purer co-representation, we use the prediction to iteratively reduce irrelevant embeddings in our co-representation. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our CoRP achieves state-of-the-art performances on the benchmark datasets. Our source code is available at https://github.com/ZZY816/CoRP.

AB Recently, one critical issue looms large in the field of recommender systems - there are no effective benchmarks for rigorous evaluation - which consequently leads to unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. We, therefore, conduct studies from the perspectives of practical theory and experiments, aiming at benchmarking recommendation for rigorous evaluation. Regarding the theoretical study, a series of hyper-factors affecting recommendation performance throughout the whole evaluation chain are systematically summarized and analyzed via an exhaustive review on 141 papers published at eight top-tier conferences within 2017-2020. We then classify them into model-independent and model-dependent hyper-factors, and different modes of rigorous evaluation are defined and discussed in-depth accordingly. For the experimental study, we release DaisyRec 2.0 library by integrating these hyper-factors to perform rigorous evaluation, whereby a holistic empirical study is conducted to unveil the impacts of different hyper-factors on recommendation performance. Supported by the theoretical and experimental studies, we finally create benchmarks for rigorous evaluation by proposing standardized procedures and providing performance of ten state-of-the-arts across six evaluation metrics on six datasets as a reference for later study. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation, provides potential solutions for rigorous evaluation, and lays foundation for further investigation.

AB Unconstrained handwritten text recognition is a challenging computer vision task. It is traditionally handled by a two-step approach, combining line segmentation followed by text line recognition. For the first time, we propose an end-to-end segmentation-free architecture for the task of handwritten document recognition: the Document Attention Network. In addition to text recognition, the model is trained to label text parts using begin and end tags in an XML-like fashion. This model is made up of an FCN encoder for feature extraction and a stack of transformer decoder layers for a recurrent token-by-token prediction process. It takes whole text documents as input and sequentially outputs characters, as well as logical layout tokens. Contrary to the existing segmentation-based approaches, the model is trained without using any segmentation label. We achieve competitive results on the READ 2016 dataset at page level, as well as double-page level with a CER of 3.43% and 3.70%, respectively. We also provide results for the RIMES 2009 dataset at page level, reaching 4.54% of CER. We provide all source code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/FactoDeepLearning/DAN.

AB In this paper, we propose a deep metric learning with adaptively composite dynamic constraints (DML-DC) method for image retrieval and clustering. Most existing deep metric learning methods impose pre-defined constraints on the training samples, which might not be optimal at all stages of training. To address this, we propose a learnable constraint generator to adaptively produce dynamic constraints to train the metric towards good generalization. We formulate the objective of deep metric learning under a proxy Collection, pair Sampling, tuple Construction, and tuple Weighting (CSCW) paradigm. For proxy collection, we progressively update a set of proxies using a cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from the current batch of samples. For pair sampling, we employ a graph neural network to model the structural relations between sample-proxy pairs to produce the preservation probabilities for each pair. Having constructed a set of tuples based on the sampled pairs, we further re-weight each training tuple to adaptively adjust its effect on the metric. We formulate the learning of the constraint generator as a meta-learning problem, where we employ an episode-based training scheme and update the generator at each iteration to adapt to the current model status. We construct each episode by sampling two subsets of disjoint labels to simulate the procedure of training and testing and use the performance of the one-gradient-updated metric on the validation subset as the meta-objective of the assessor. We conducted extensive experiments on five widely used benchmarks under two evaluation protocols to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

AB Adverse weather conditions in real-world scenarios lead to performance degradation of deep learning-based detection models. A well-known method is to use image restoration methods to enhance degraded images before object detection. However, how to build a positive correlation between these two tasks is still technically challenging. The restoration labels are also unavailable in practice. To this end, taking the hazy scene as an example, we propose a union architecture BAD-Net that connects the dehazing module and detection module in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we design a two-branch structure with an attention fusion module for fully combining hazy and dehazing features. This reduces bad impacts on the detection module when the dehazing module performs poorly. Besides, we introduce a self-supervised haze robust loss that enables the detection module to deal with different degrees of haze. Most importantly, an interval iterative data refinement training strategy is proposed to guide the dehazing module learning with weak supervision. BAD-Net improves further detection performance through detection-friendly dehazing. Extensive experiments on RTTS and VOChaze datasets show that BAD-Net achieves higher accuracy compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods. It is a robust detection framework for bridging the gap between low-level dehazing and high-level detection.

AB In this work, we study the challenging problem of instance-aware human body part parsing. We introduce a new bottom-up regime which achieves the task through learning category-level human semantic segmentation as well as multi-person pose estimation in a joint and end-to-end manner. The output is a compact, efficient and powerful framework that exploits structural information over different human granularities and eases the difficulty of person partitioning. Specifically, a dense-to-sparse projection field, which allows explicitly associating dense human semantics with sparse keypoints, is learnt and progressively improved over the network feature pyramid for robustness. Then, the difficult pixel grouping problem is cast as an easier, multi-person joint assembling task. By formulating joint association as maximum-weight bipartite matching, we develop two novel algorithms based on projected gradient descent and unbalanced optimal transport, respectively, to solve the matching problem differentiablly. These algorithms make our method end-to-end trainable and allow back-propagating the grouping error to directly supervise multi-granularity human representation learning. This is significantly distinguished from current bottom-up human parsers or pose estimators which require sophisticated post-processing or heuristic greedy algorithms. Extensive experiments on three instance-aware human parsing datasets (i.e., MHP-v2, DensePose-COCO, PASCAL-Person-Part) demonstrate that our approach outperforms most existing human parsers with much more efficient inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/tfzhou/MG-HumanParsing.

AB Classic embedded feature selection algorithms are often divided in two large groups: tree-based algorithms and LASSO variants. Both approaches are focused in different aspects: while the tree-based algorithms provide a clear explanation about which variables are being used to trigger a certain output, LASSO-like approaches sacrifice a detailed explanation in favor of increasing its accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel embedded feature selection algorithm, called End-to-End Feature Selection (E2E-FS), that aims to provide both accuracy and explainability in a clever way. Despite having non-convex regularization terms, our algorithm, similar to the LASSO approach, is solved with gradient descent techniques, introducing some restrictions that force the model to specifically select a maximum number of features that are going to be used subsequently by the classifier. Although these are hard restrictions, the experimental results obtained show that this algorithm can be used with any learning model that is trained using a gradient descent algorithm.

AB Recently, fusing the LiDAR point cloud and camera image to improve the performance and robustness of 3D object detection has received more and more attention, as these two modalities naturally possess strong complementarity. In this paper, we propose EPNet++ for multi-modal 3D object detection by introducing a novel Cascade Bi-directional Fusion (CB-Fusion) module and a Multi-Modal Consistency (MC) loss. More concretely, the proposed CB-Fusion module enhances point features with plentiful semantic information absorbed from the image features in a cascade bi-directional interaction fusion manner, leading to more powerful and discriminative feature representations. The MC loss explicitly guarantees the consistency between predicted scores from two modalities to obtain more comprehensive and reliable confidence scores. The experimental results on the KITTI, JRDB and SUN-RGBD datasets demonstrate the superiority of EPNet++ over the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we emphasize a critical but easily overlooked problem, which is to explore the performance and robustness of a 3D detector in a sparser scene. Extensive experiments present that EPNet++ outperforms the existing SOTA methods with remarkable margins in highly sparse point cloud cases, which might be an available direction to reduce the expensive cost of LiDAR sensors.

AB Detecting digital face manipulation has attracted extensive attention due to fake media's potential risks to the public. However, recent advances have been able to reduce the forgery signals to a low magnitude. Decomposition, which reversibly decomposes an image into several constituent elements, is a promising way to highlight the hidden forgery details. In this paper, we investigate a novel 3D decomposition based method that considers a face image as the production of the interaction between 3D geometry and lighting environment. Specifically, we disentangle a face image into four graphics components including 3D shape, lighting, common texture, and identity texture, which are respectively constrained by 3D morphable model, harmonic reflectance illumination, and PCA texture model. Meanwhile, we build a fine-grained morphing network to predict 3D shapes with pixel-level accuracy to reduce the noise in the decomposed elements. Moreover, we propose a composition search strategy that enables an automatic construction of an architecture to mine forgery clues from forgery-relevant components. Extensive experiments validate that the decomposed components highlight forgery artifacts, and the searched architecture extracts discriminative forgery features. Thus, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Latent fingerprint enhancement is an essential preprocessing step for latent fingerprint identification. Most latent fingerprint enhancement methods try to restore corrupted gray ridges/valleys. In this paper, we propose a new method that formulates latent fingerprint enhancement as a constrained fingerprint generation problem within a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. We name the proposed network FingerGAN. It can enforce its generated fingerprint (i.e, enhanced latent fingerprint) indistinguishable from the corresponding ground truth instance in terms of the fingerprint skeleton map weighted by minutia locations and the orientation field regularized by the FOMFE model. Because minutia is the primary feature for fingerprint recognition and minutia can be retrieved directly from the fingerprint skeleton map, we offer a holistic framework that can perform latent fingerprint enhancement in the context of directly optimizing minutia information. This will help improve latent fingerprint identification performance significantly. Experimental results on two public latent fingerprint databases demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the arts significantly. The codes will be available for non-commercial purposes from https://github.com/HubYZ/LatentEnhancement.

AB Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that measure per-pixel brightness differences asynchronously. Recovering brightness from events is appealing since the reconstructed images inherit the high dynamic range (HDR) and high-speed properties of events; hence they can be used in many robotic vision applications and to generate slow-motion HDR videos. However, state-of-the-art methods tackle this problem by training an event-to-image Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which lacks explainability and is difficult to tune. In this work we show, for the first time, how tackling the combined problem of motion and brightness estimation leads us to formulate event-based image reconstruction as a linear inverse problem that can be solved without training an image reconstruction RNN. Instead, classical and learning-based regularizers are used to solve the problem and remove artifacts from the reconstructed images. The experiments show that the proposed approach generates images with visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods despite only using data from a short time interval. State-of-the-art results are achieved using an image denoising Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the regularization function. The proposed regularized formulation and solvers have a unifying character because they can be applied also to reconstruct brightness from the second derivative. Additionally, the formulation is attractive because it can be naturally combined with super-resolution, motion-segmentation and color demosaicing.

AB This paper proposes a novel paradigm for the unsupervised learning of object landmark detectors. Contrary to existing methods that build on auxiliary tasks such as image generation or equivariance, we propose a self-training approach where, departing from generic keypoints, a landmark detector and descriptor is trained to improve itself, tuning the keypoints into distinctive landmarks. To this end, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between producing new pseudo-labels through feature clustering and learning distinctive features for each pseudo-class through contrastive learning. With a shared backbone for the landmark detector and descriptor, the keypoint locations progressively converge to stable landmarks, filtering those less stable. Compared to previous works, our approach can learn points that are more flexible in terms of capturing large viewpoint changes. We validate our method on a variety of difficult datasets, including LS3D, BBCPose, Human3.6M and PennAction, achieving new state of the art results.

AB Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) is a classical method that estimates fluid flow by analyzing the motion of injected particles. To reconstruct and track the swirling particles is a difficult computer vision problem, as the particles are dense in the fluid volume and have similar appearances. Further, tracking a large number of particles is particularly challenging due to heavy occlusion. Here we present a low-cost PIV solution that uses compact lenslet-based light field cameras as imaging device. We develop novel optimization algorithms for dense particle 3D reconstruction and tracking. As a single light field camera has limited capacity in resolving depth (z-dimension measurement), the resolution of 3D reconstruction on the x-y plane is much higher than along the z-axis. To compensate for the imbalanced resolution in 3D, we use two light field cameras positioned at an orthogonal angle to capture particle images. In this way, we can achieve high-resolution 3D particle reconstruction in the full fluid volume. For each time frame, we first estimate particle depths under a single viewpoint by exploiting the focal stack symmetry of light field. We then fuse the recovered 3D particles in two views by solving a linear assignment problem (LAP). Specifically, we propose an anisotropic point-to-ray distance as matching cost to handle the resolution mismatch. Finally, given a sequence of 3D particle reconstructions over time, we recover the full-volume 3D fluid flow with a physically-constrained optical flow, which enforces local motion rigidity and fluid incompressibility. We perform comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real data for ablation and evaluation. We show that our method recovers full-volume 3D fluid flows of various types. Two-view reconstruction results achieves higher accuracy than those with one view only.

AB Conversations have become a critical data format on social media platforms. Understanding conversation from emotion, content and other aspects also attracts increasing attention from researchers due to its widespread application in human-computer interaction. In real-world environments, we often encounter the problem of incomplete modalities, which has become a core issue of conversation understanding. To address this problem, researchers propose various methods. However, existing approaches are mainly designed for individual utterances rather than conversational data, which cannot fully exploit temporal and speaker information in conversations. To this end, we propose a novel framework for incomplete multimodal learning in conversations, called "Graph Complete Network (GCNet)," filling the gap of existing works. Our GCNet contains two well-designed graph neural network-based modules, "Speaker GNN" and "Temporal GNN," to capture temporal and speaker dependencies. To make full use of complete and incomplete data, we jointly optimize classification and reconstruction tasks in an end-to-end manner. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three benchmark conversational datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our GCNet is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in incomplete multimodal learning.

AB The minimal geodesic models established upon the eikonal equation framework are capable of finding suitable solutions in various image segmentation scenarios. Existing geodesic-based segmentation approaches usually exploit image features in conjunction with geometric regularization terms, such as euclidean curve length or curvature-penalized length, for computing geodesic curves. In this paper, we take into account a more complicated problem: finding curvature-penalized geodesic paths with a convexity shape prior. We establish new geodesic models relying on the strategy of orientation-lifting, by which a planar curve can be mapped to an high-dimensional orientation-dependent space. The convexity shape prior serves as a constraint for the construction of local geodesic metrics encoding a particular curvature constraint. Then the geodesic distances and the corresponding closed geodesic paths in the orientation-lifted space can be efficiently computed through state-of-the-art Hamiltonian fast marching method. In addition, we apply the proposed geodesic models to the active contours, leading to efficient interactive image segmentation algorithms that preserve the advantages of convexity shape prior and curvature penalization.

AB Self-similarity is valuable to the exploration of non-local textures in single image super-resolution (SISR). Researchers usually assume that the importance of non-local textures is positively related to their similarity scores. In this paper, we surprisingly found that when repairing severely damaged query textures, some non-local textures with low-similarity which are closer to the target can provide more accurate and richer details than the high-similarity ones. In these cases, low-similarity does not mean inferior but is usually caused by different scales or orientations. Utilizing this finding, we proposed a Global Learnable Attention (GLA) to adaptively modify similarity scores of non-local textures during training instead of only using a fixed similarity scoring function such as the dot product. The proposed GLA can explore non-local textures with low-similarity but more accurate details to repair severely damaged textures. Furthermore, we propose to adopt Super-Bit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (SB-LSH) as a preprocessing method for our GLA. With the SB-LSH, the computational complexity of our GLA is reduced from quadratic to asymptotic linear with respect to the image size. In addition, the proposed GLA can be integrated into existing deep SISR models as an efficient general building block. Based on the GLA, we constructed a Deep Learnable Similarity Network (DLSN), which achieves state-of-the-art performance for SISR tasks of different degradation types (e.g., blur and noise). Our code and a pre-trained DLSN have been uploaded to GitHub(dagger) for validation.

AB In the paper, we study a class of useful minimax problems on Riemanian manifolds and propose a class of effective Riemanian gradient-based methods to solve these minimax problems. Specifically, we propose an effective Riemannian gradient descent ascent (RGDA) algorithm for the deterministic minimax optimization. Moreover, we prove that our RGDA has a sample complexity of O(kappa(2)epsilon(-2)) for finding an epsilon-stationary solution of the Geodesically-Nonconvex Strongly-Concave (GNSC) minimax problems, where kappa denotes the condition number. At the same time, we present an effective Riemannian stochastic gradient descent ascent (RSGDA) algorithm for the stochastic minimax optimization, which has a sample complexity of O(kappa(4)epsilon(-4)) for finding an epsilon-stationary solution. To further reduce the sample complexity, we propose an accelerated Riemannian stochastic gradient descent ascent (Acc-RSGDA) algorithm based on the momentum-based variance-reduced technique. We prove that our Acc-RSGDA algorithm achieves a lower sample complexity of (O) over tilde(kappa(4)epsilon(-3)) in searching for an epsilon-stationary solution of the GNSC minimax problems.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have successfully boosted skeleton-based human action recognition. However, existing GCN-based methods mostly cast the problem as separated person's action recognition while ignoring the interaction between the action initiator and the action responder, especially for the fundamental two-person interactive action recognition. It is still challenging to effectively take into account the intrinsic local-global clues of the two-person activity. Additionally, message passing in GCN depends on adjacency matrix, but skeleton-based human action recognition methods tend to calculate the adjacency matrix with the fixed natural skeleton connectivity. It means that messages can only travel along a fixed path at different layers of the network or in different actions, which greatly reduces the flexibility of the network. To this end, we propose a novel graph diffusion convolutional network for skeleton based semantic recognition of two-person actions by embedding the graph diffusion into GCNs. At technical fronts, we dynamically construct the adjacency matrix based on practical action information, so that we can guide the message propagation in a more meaningful way. Simultaneously, we introduce the frame importance calculation module to conduct dynamic convolution, so that we can avoid the negative effect caused by the traditional convolution, wherein the shared weights may fail to capture key frames or be affected by noisy frames. Besides, we comprehensively leverage the multidimensional features related to joints' local visual appearances, global spatial relationship and temporal coherency, and for different features, different metrics are designed to measure the similarity underlying the corresponding real physical law of the motions. Moreover, extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on four public large-scale datasets (NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton 400, and SBU-Interaction) demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Human activity understanding is of widespread interest in artificial intelligence and spans diverse applications like health care and behavior analysis. Although there have been advances with deep learning, it remains challenging. The object recognition-like solutions usually try to map pixels to semantics directly, but activity patterns are much different from object patterns, thus hindering another success. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm to reformulate this task in two-stage: first mapping pixels to an intermediate space spanned by atomic activity primitives, then programming detected primitives with interpretable logic rules to infer semantics. To afford a representative primitive space, we build a knowledge base including 26+ M primitive labels and logic rules from human priors or automatic discovering. Our framework, Human Activity Knowledge Engine (HAKE), exhibits superior generalization ability and performance upon canonical methods on challenging benchmarks. Code and data are available at http://hake-mvig.cn/.

ID VISUAL TRACKING
AB Correlation has a critical role in the tracking field, especially in recent popular Siamese-based trackers. The correlation operation is a simple fusion method that considers the similarity between the template and the search region. However, the correlation operation is a local linear matching process, losing semantic information and easily falling into a local optimum, which may be the bottleneck in designing high-accuracy tracking algorithms. In this work, to determine whether a better feature fusion method exists than correlation, a novel attention-based feature fusion network, inspired by the transformer, is presented. This network effectively combines the template and search region features using attention mechanism. Specifically, the proposed method includes an ego-context augment module based on self-attention and a cross-feature augment module based on cross-attention. First, we present a transformer tracking (named TransT) method based on the Siamese-like feature extraction backbone, the designed attention-based fusion mechanism, and the classification and regression heads. Based on the TransT baseline, we also design a segmentation branch to generate the accurate mask. Finally, we propose a stronger version of TransT by extending it with a multi-template scheme and an IoU prediction head, named TransT-M. Experiments show that our TransT and TransT-M methods achieve promising results on seven popular benchmarks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/chenxin-dlut/TransT-M.

AB Recent works attempt to employ pre-training in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). However, these methods neglect the importance of historical contexts or ignore predicting future actions during pre-training, limiting the learning of visual-textual correspondence and the capability of decision-making. To address these problems, we present a history-enhanced and order-aware pre-training with the complementing fine-tuning paradigm (HOP+) for VLN. Specifically, besides the common Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Trajectory-Instruction Matching (TIM) tasks, we design three novel VLN-specific proxy tasks: Action Prediction with History (APH) task, Trajectory Order Modeling (TOM) task and Group Order Modeling (GOM) task. APH task takes into account the visual perception trajectory to enhance the learning of historical knowledge as well as action prediction. The two temporal visual-textual alignment tasks, TOM and GOM further improve the agent's ability to order reasoning. Moreover, we design a memory network to address the representation inconsistency of history context between the pre-training and the fine-tuning stages. The memory network effectively selects and summarizes historical information for action prediction during fine-tuning, without costing huge extra computation consumption for downstream VLN tasks. HOP+ achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four downstream VLN tasks (R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and NDH), which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

AB This article examines performance evaluation criteria for basic vision tasks involving sets of objects namely, object detection, instance-level segmentation and multi-object tracking. The rankings of algorithms by a criterion can fluctuate with different choices of parameters, e.g. Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold, making their evaluations unreliable. More importantly, there is no means to verify whether we can trust the evaluations of a criterion. This work suggests a notion of trustworthiness for performance criteria, which requires (i) robustness to parameters for reliability, (ii) contextual meaningfulness in sanity tests, and (iii) consistency with mathematical requirements such as the metric properties. We observe that these requirements were overlooked by many widely-used criteria, and explore alternative criteria using metrics for sets of shapes. We also assess all these criteria based on the suggested requirements for trustworthiness.

AB Reconstruction of high dynamic range image from a single low dynamic range image captured by a conventional RGB camera, which suffers from over- or under-exposure, is an ill-posed problem. In contrast, recent neuromorphic cameras like event camera and spike camera can record high dynamic range scenes in the form of intensity maps, but with much lower spatial resolution and no color information. In this article, we propose a hybrid imaging system (denoted as NeurImg) that captures and fuses the visual information from a neuromorphic camera and ordinary images from an RGB camera to reconstruct high-quality high dynamic range images and videos. The proposed NeurImg-HDR+ network consists of specially designed modules, which bridges the domain gaps on resolution, dynamic range, and color representation between two types of sensors and images to reconstruct high-resolution, high dynamic range images and videos. We capture a test dataset of hybrid signals on various HDR scenes using the hybrid camera, and analyze the advantages of the proposed fusing strategy by comparing it to state-of-the-art inverse tone mapping methods and merging two low dynamic range images approaches. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on both synthetic data and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid high dynamic range imaging system.

TI Hyperparameter-Free Localized Simple Multiple Kernel K-means With Global

AB The newly proposed localized simple multiple kernel k-means (SimpleMKKM) provides an elegant clustering framework which sufficiently considers the potential variation among samples. Although achieving superior clustering performance in some applications, we observe that it is required to pre-specify an extra hyperparameter, which determines the size of the localization. This greatly limits its availability in practical applications since there is a little guideline to set a suitable hyperparameter in clustering tasks. To overcome this issue, we firstly parameterize a neighborhood mask matrix as a quadratic combination of a set of pre-computed base neighborhood mask matrices, which corresponds to a group of hyperparameters. We then propose to jointly learn the optimal coefficient of these neighborhood mask matrices together with the clustering tasks. By this way, we obtain the proposed hyperparameter-free localized SimpleMKKM, which corresponds to a more intractable minimization-minimization-maximization optimization problem. We rewrite the resultant optimization as a minimization of an optimal value function, prove its differentiability, and develop a gradient based algorithm to solve it. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the obtained optimum is the global one. Comprehensive experimental study on several benchmark datasets verifies its effectiveness, comparing with several state-of-the-art counterparts in the recent literature. The source code for hyperparameter-free localized SimpleMKKM is available at https://github.com/xinwangliu/SimpleMKKMcodes/.

ID VISUAL COMPLEXITY; BEAUTY
AB Image complexity (IC) is an essential visual perception for human beings to understand an image. However, explicitly evaluating the IC is challenging, and has long been overlooked since, on the one hand, the evaluation of IC is relatively subjective due to its dependence on human perception, and on the other hand, the IC is semantic-dependent while real-world images are diverse. To facilitate the research of IC assessment in this deep learning era, we built the first, to our best knowledge, large-scale IC dataset with 9,600 well-annotated images. The images are of diverse areas such as abstract, paintings and real-world scenes, each of which is elaborately annotated by 17 human contributors. Powered by this high-quality dataset, we further provide a base model to predict the IC scores and estimate the complexity density maps in a weakly supervised way. The model is verified to be effective, and correlates well with human perception (with the Pearson correlation coefficient being 0.949). Last but not the least, we have empirically validated that the exploration of IC can provide auxiliary information and boost the performance of a wide range of computer vision tasks. The dataset and source code can be found at https://github.com/tinglyfeng/IC9600.

TI Interactive Object Segmentation With Inside-Outside Guidance
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep learning; image segmentation; interactive segmentation
ID CUT
AB This article explores how to harvest precise object segmentation masks while minimizing the human interaction cost. To achieve this, we propose a simple yet effective interaction scheme, named Inside-Outside Guidance (IOG). Concretely, we leverage an inside point that is clicked near the object center and two outside points at the symmetrical corner locations (top-left and bottom-right or top-right and bottom-left) of an almost-tight bounding box that encloses the target object. The interaction results in a total of one foreground click and four background clicks for segmentation. The advantages of our IOG are four-fold: 1) the two outside points can help remove distractions from other objects or background; 2) the inside point can help eliminate the unrelated regions inside the bounding box; 3) the inside and outside points are easily identified, reducing the confusion raised by the state-of-the-art DEXTR Maninis et al. 2018, in labeling some extreme samples; 4) it naturally supports additional click annotations for further correction. Despite its simplicity, our IOG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmarks such as GrabCut Rother et al. 2004, PASCAL Everingham et al. 2010 and MS COCO Russakovsky et al. 2015, but also demonstrates strong generalization capability across different domains such as street scenes (Cityscapes Cordts et al. 2016), aerial imagery (Rooftop Sun et al. 2014 and Agriculture-Vision Chiu et al. 2020) and medical images (ssTEM Gerhard et al. 2013).

DT Article
DE Causality; distributional shift; contextual bandits; off-policy learning
ID INFERENCE; SELECTION; DIAGRAMS
AB Contextual bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms have been successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as online advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they have yet to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare. One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the underlying mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over different environments. In many real-world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static environment assumption. In this paper, we take a step toward tackling the problem of environmental shifts considering the framework of offline contextual bandits. We view the environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and propose multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the underlying mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality literature and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy invariance is only relevant if unobserved variables are present and show that, in that case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across environments under suitable assumptions.

DE Graph reasoning; knowledge-guided learning; long-tailed problem;
   situation recognition
AB The task of situation recognition aims to solve the visual reasoning problem with the ability to predict the activity happening (salient action) in an image and the nouns of all associated semantic roles playing in the activity. This poses severe challenges due to long-tailed data distributions and local class ambiguities. Prior works only propagate the local noun-level features on one single image without utilizing global information. We propose a Knowledge-aware Global Reasoning (KGR) framework to endow neural networks with the capability of adaptive global reasoning over nouns by exploiting diverse statistical knowledge. Our KGR is a local-global architecture, which consists of a local encoder to generate noun features using local relations and a global encoder to enhance the noun features via global reasoning supervised by an external global knowledge pool. The global knowledge pool is created by counting the pairwise relationships of nouns in the dataset. In this paper, we design an action-guided pairwise knowledge as the global knowledge pool based on the characteristic of the situation recognition task. Extensive experiments have shown that our KGR not only achieves state-of-the-art results on a large-scale situation recognition benchmark, but also effectively solves the long-tailed problem of noun classification by our global knowledge.

DT Article
DE Encoder-decoder; group-wise semantic; knowledge-enriched attention;
   multi-modal decoder; visual storytelling
AB As a technically challenging topic, visual storytelling aims at generating an imaginary and coherent story with narrative multi-sentences from a group of relevant images. Existing methods often generate direct and rigid descriptions of apparent image-based contents, because they are not capable of exploring implicit information beyond images. Hence, these schemes could not capture consistent dependencies from holistic representation, impairing the generation of reasonable and fluent stories. To address these problems, a novel knowledge-enriched attention network with group-wise semantic model is proposed. Three main novel components are designed and supported by substantial experiments to reveal practical advantages. First, a knowledge-enriched attention network is designed to extract implicit concepts from external knowledge system, and these concepts are followed by a cascade cross-modal attention mechanism to characterize imaginative and concrete representations. Second, a group-wise semantic module with second-order pooling is developed to explore the globally consistent guidance. Third, a unified one-stage story generation model with encoder-decoder structure is proposed to simultaneously train and infer the knowledge-enriched attention network, group-wise semantic module and multi-modal story generation decoder in an end-to-end fashion. Substantial experiments on the visual storytelling datasets with both objective and subjective evaluation metrics demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme as compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Though 3D convolutions are able to recognize which object is performing the described actions, they still introduce misaligned spatial information from adjacent frames, which inevitably confuses features of the target frame and leads to inaccurate segmentation. To tackle this issue, we propose a language-aware spatial-temporal collaboration framework that contains a 3D temporal encoder upon the video clip to recognize the described actions, and a 2D spatial encoder upon the target frame to provide undisturbed spatial features of the referred object. For multimodal features extraction, we propose a Cross-Modal Adaptive Modulation (CMAM) module and its improved version CMAM+ to conduct adaptive cross-modal interaction in the encoders with spatial- or temporal-relevant language features which are also updated progressively to enrich linguistic global context. In addition, we also propose a Language-Aware Semantic Propagation (LASP) module in the decoder to propagate semantic information from deep stages to the shallow stages with language-aware sampling and assignment, which is able to highlight language-compatible foreground visual features and suppress language-incompatible background visual features for better facilitating the spatial-temporal collaboration. Extensive experiments on four popular referring video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the previous state-of-the-art methods.

DE Synthetic aperture imaging; event camera; spiking neural network
AB Although synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) can achieve the seeing-through effect by blurring out off-focus foreground occlusions while recovering in-focus occluded scenes from multi-view images, its performance is often deteriorated by dense occlusions and extreme lighting conditions. To address the problem, this paper presents an Event-based SAI (E-SAI) method by relying on the asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range acquired by an event camera. Specifically, the collected events are first refocused by a Refocus-Net module to align in-focus events while scattering out off-focus ones. Following that, a hybrid network composed of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed to encode the spatio-temporal information from the refocused events and reconstruct a visual image of the occluded targets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed E-SAI method can achieve remarkable performance in dealing with very dense occlusions and extreme lighting conditions and produce high-quality images from pure events.

AB Compared with contact-based fingerprint acquisition techniques, contactless acquisition has the advantages of less skin distortion, more complete fingerprint area, and hygienic acquisition. However, perspective distortion is a challenge in contactless fingerprint recognition, which changes the ridge frequency and relative minutiae location, and thus degrades the recognition accuracy. We propose a learning-based shape-from-texture algorithm to reconstruct a 3-D finger shape from a single image and unwarp the raw image to suppress the perspective distortion. Our experimental results for 3-D reconstruction on contactless fingerprint databases show that the proposed method has high 3-D reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results for contactless-to-contactless and contactless-to-contact-based fingerprint matching indicate that the proposed method can improve the matching accuracy.

AB This article proposes a multi-label classification algorithm capable of continual learning by applying an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based clustering algorithm and the Bayesian approach for label probability computation. The ART-based clustering algorithm adaptively and continually generates prototype nodes corresponding to given data, and the generated nodes are used as classifiers. The label probability computation independently counts the number of label appearances for each class and calculates the Bayesian probabilities. Thus, the label probability computation can cope with an increase in the number of labels. Experimental results with synthetic and real-world multi-label datasets show that the proposed algorithm has competitive classification performance to other well-known algorithms while realizing continual learning.

TI Neural Radiance Fields From Sparse RGB-D Images for High-Quality View

DT Article
DE Novel view synthesis; neural rendering; neural radiance fields
AB The recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF) use a continuous function formulated as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model the appearance and geometry of a 3D scene. This enables realistic synthesis of novel views, even for scenes with view dependent appearance. Many follow-up works have since extended NeRFs in different ways. However, a fundamental restriction of the method remains that it requires a large number of images captured from densely placed viewpoints for high-quality synthesis and the quality of the results quickly degrades when the number of captured views is insufficient. To address this problem, we propose a novel NeRF-based framework capable of high-quality view synthesis using only a sparse set of RGB-D images, which can be easily captured using cameras and LiDAR sensors on current consumer devices. First, a geometric proxy of the scene is reconstructed from the captured RGB-D images. Renderings of the reconstructed scene along with precise camera parameters can then be used to pre-train a network. Finally, the network is fine-tuned with a small number of real captured images. We further introduce a patch discriminator to supervise the network under novel views during fine-tuning, as well as a 3D color prior to improve synthesis quality. We demonstrate that our method can generate arbitrary novel views of a 3D scene from as few as 6 RGB-D images. Extensive experiments show the improvements of our method compared with the existing NeRF-based methods, including approaches that also aim to reduce the number of input images.

TI Non-Graph Data Clustering via <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) Bipartite Graph
   Convolution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Anchors; efficient clustering; graph convolution network;
   self-supervised learning; siamese network
AB Since the representative capacity of graph-based clustering methods is usually limited by the graph constructed on the original features, it is attractive to find whether graph neural networks (GNNs), a strong extension of neural networks to graphs, can be applied to augment the capacity of graph-based clustering methods. The core problems mainly come from two aspects. On the one hand, the graph is unavailable in the most general clustering scenes so that how to construct graph on the non-graph data and the quality of graph is usually the most important part. On the other hand, given n samples, the graph-based clustering methods usually consume at least O(n(2)) time to build graphs and the graph convolution requires nearly O(n(2)) for a dense graph and O(vertical bar E vertical bar) for a sparse one with vertical bar E vertical bar edges. Accordingly, both graph-based clustering and GNNs suffer from the severe inefficiency problem. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel clustering method, AnchorGAE, with the self-supervised estimation of graph and efficient graph convolution. We first show how to convert a non-graph dataset into a graph dataset, by introducing the generative graph model and anchors. A bipartite graph is built via generating anchors and estimating the connectivity distributions of original points and anchors. We then show that the constructed bipartite graph can reduce the computational complexity of graph convolution from O(n(2)) and O(vertical bar E vertical bar) to O(n). The succeeding steps for clustering can be easily designed as O(n) operations. Interestingly, the anchors naturally lead to siamese architecture with the help of the Markov process. Furthermore, the estimated bipartite graph is updated dynamically according to the features extracted by GNN modules, to promote the quality of the graph by exploiting the high-level information by GNNs. However, we theoretically prove that the self-supervised paradigm frequently results in a collapse that often occurs after 2-3 update iterations in experiments, especially when the model is well-trained. A specific strategy is accordingly designed to prevent the collapse. The experiments support the theoretical analysis and show the superiority of AnchorGAE.

AB We introduce a new image segmentation task, called Entity Segmentation (ES), which aims to segment all visual entities ( objects and stuffs) in an image without predicting their semantic labels. By removing the need of class label prediction, the models trained for such task can focus more on improving segmentation quality. It has many practical applications such as image manipulation and editing where the quality of segmentation masks is crucial but class labels are less important. We conduct the first-ever study to investigate the feasibility of convolutional center-based representation to segment things and stuffs in a unified manner, and show that such representation fits exceptionally well in the context of ES. More specifically, we propose a CondInst-like fully-convolutional architecture with two novel modules specifically designed to exploit the classagnostic and non-overlapping requirements of ES. Experiments show that the models designed and trained for ES significantly outperforms popular class-specific panoptic segmentation models in terms of segmentation quality. Moreover, an ES model can be easily trained on a combination of multiple datasets without the need to resolve label conflicts in dataset merging, and the model trained for ES on one or more datasets can generalize very well to other test datasets of unseen domains. The code has been released at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Entity.

TI Orientational Distribution Learning With Hierarchical Spatial Attention
   for Open Set Recognition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DE Composite feature space; hierarchical spatial attention; open set
   recognition; orientational distribution learning
AB Open set recognition (OSR) aims to correctly recognize the known classes and reject the unknown classes for increasing the reliability of the recognition system. The distance-based loss is often employed in deep neural networks-based OSR methods to constrain the latent representation of known classes. However, the optimization is usually conducted using the nondirectional euclidean distance in a single feature space without considering the potential impact of spatial distribution. To address this problem, we propose orientational distribution learning (ODL) with hierarchical spatial attention for OSR. In ODL, the spatial distribution of feature representation is optimized orientationally to increase the discriminability of decision boundaries for open set recognition. Then, a hierarchical spatial attention mechanism is proposed to assist ODL to capture the global distribution dependencies in the feature space based on spatial relationships. Moreover, a composite feature space is constructed to integrate the features from different layers and different mapping approaches, and it can well enrich the representation information. Finally, a decision-level fusion method is developed to combine the composite feature space and the naive feature space for producing a more comprehensive classification result. The effectiveness of ODL has been demonstrated on various benchmark datasets, and ODL achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI Orthogonal SVD Covariance Conditioning and Latent Disentanglement
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Covariance conditioning; differentiable SVD; orthogonality constraint;
   unsupervised latent disentanglement
AB Inserting an SVD meta-layer into neural networks is prone to make the covariance ill-conditioned, which could harm the model in the training stability and generalization abilities. In this article, we systematically study how to improve the covariance conditioning by enforcing orthogonality to the Pre-SVD layer. Existing orthogonal treatments on the weights are first investigated. However, these techniques can improve the conditioning but would hurt the performance. To avoid such a side effect, we propose the Nearest Orthogonal Gradient (NOG) and Optimal Learning Rate (OLR). The effectiveness of our methods is validated in two applications: decorrelated Batch Normalization (BN) and Global Covariance Pooling (GCP). Extensive experiments on visual recognition demonstrate that our methods can simultaneously improve covariance conditioning and generalization. The combinations with orthogonal weight can further boost the performance. Moreover, we show that our orthogonality techniques can benefit generative models for better latent disentanglement through a series of experiments on various benchmarks.

ID MANIFOLD REGULARIZATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a well-labeled source domain to a related and unlabeled target domain with identical label space. The main workhorse in UDA is domain alignment and has proven successful. However, it is practically difficult to find an appropriate source domain with identical label space. A more practical scenario is partial domain adaptation (PDA) where the source label space subsumes the target one. Unfortunately, due to the non-identity between label spaces, it is extremely hard to obtain an ideal alignment, conversely, easier resulting in mode collapse and negative transfer. These motivate us to find a relatively simpler alternative to solve PDA. To achieve this, we first explore a theoretical analysis, which says that the target risk is bounded by both model smoothness and between-domain discrepancy. Then, we instantiate the model smoothness as an intra-domain structure preserving (IDSP) while giving up possibly riskier domain alignment. To our best knowledge, this is the first naive attempt for PDA without alignment. Finally, our empirical results on benchmarks demonstrate that IDSP is not only superior to the PDA SOTAs (e.g., similar to+10% on Cl! Rw and similar to+8% on Ar -> Rw), but also complementary to domain alignment in the standard UDA.

DE Multi-view reconstruction; inverse rendering; polarization
ID PHOTOMETRIC STEREO; 3D RECONSTRUCTION; POLARIZATION; SHAPE
AB A polarization camera has great potential for 3D reconstruction since the angle of polarization (AoP) and the degree of polarization (DoP) of reflected light are related to an object's surface normal. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction method called Polarimetric Multi-View Inverse Rendering (Polarimetric MVIR) that effectively exploits geometric, photometric, and polarimetric cues extracted from input multi-view color-polarization images. We first estimate camera poses and an initial 3D model by geometric reconstruction with a standard structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipeline. We then refine the initial model by optimizing photometric rendering errors and polarimetric errors using multi-view RGB, AoP, and DoP images, where we propose a novel polarimetric cost function that enables an effective constraint on the estimated surface normal of each vertex, while considering four possible ambiguous azimuth angles revealed from the AoP measurement. The weight for the polarimetric cost is effectively determined based on the DoP measurement, which is regarded as the reliability of polarimetric information. Experimental results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our Polarimetric MVIR can reconstruct a detailed 3D shape without assuming a specific surface material and lighting condition.

ID QUANTIZATION
AB In this article, we propose extremely low-precision vision transformers called Quantformer for efficient inference. Conventional network quantization methods directly quantize weights and activations of fully-connected layers without considering properties of transformer architectures. Quantization sizably deviates the self-attention compared with full-precision counterparts, and the shared quantization strategy for diversely distributed patch features causes severe quantization errors. To address these issues, we enforce the self-attention rank in quantized transformers to mimic that in full-precision counterparts with capacity-aware distribution for information retention, and quantize patch features with group-wise discretization strategy for quantization error minimization. Specifically, we efficiently preserve the self-attention rank consistency by minimizing the distance between the self-attention in quantized and real-valued transformers with adaptive concentration degree, where the optimal concentration degree is selected according to the self-attention entropy for model capacity adaptation. Moreover, we partition patch features in different dimensions with differentiable group assignment, so that features in different groups leverage various discretization strategies with minimal rounding and clipping errors. Experimental results show that our Quantformer outperforms the state-of-the-art network quantization methods by a sizable margin across various vision transformer architectures in image classification and object detection. We also integrate our Quantformer with mixed-precision quantization to further enhance the performance of the vanilla models.

DT Article
DE Cross-image semantic consistency; label rectifying; semantic
   segmentation; semi-supervised learning
AB Semi-supervised semantic segmentation aims to learn a semantic segmentation model via limited labeled images and adequate unlabeled images. The key to this task is generating reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled images. Existing methods mainly focus on producing reliable pseudo labels based on the confidence scores of unlabeled images while largely ignoring the use of labeled images with accurate annotations. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Image Semantic Consistency guided Rectifying (CISC-R) approach for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which explicitly leverages the labeled images to rectify the generated pseudo labels. Our CISC-R is inspired by the fact that images belonging to the same class have a high pixel-level correspondence. Specifically, given an unlabeled image and its initial pseudo labels, we first query a guiding labeled image that shares the same semantic information with the unlabeled image. Then, we estimate the pixel-level similarity between the unlabeled image and the queried labeled image to form a CISC map, which guides us to achieve a reliable pixel-level rectification for the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on the PASCALVOC 2012, Cityscapes, and COCO datasets demonstrate that the proposed CISC-R can significantly improve the quality of the pseudo labels and outperform the state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Luffy03/CISC-R.

AB Scene recovery is a fundamental imaging task with several practical applications, including video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, etc. In this article, we provide a new real-time scene recovery framework to restore degraded images under different weather/imaging conditions, such as underwater, sand dust and haze. A degraded image can actually be seen as a superimposition of a clear image with the same color imaging environment (underwater, sand or haze, etc.). Mathematically, we can introduce a rank-one matrix to characterize this phenomenon, i.e., rank-one prior (ROP). Using the prior, a direct method with the complexity OoNTHORN is derived for real-time recovery. For general cases, we develop ROPthorn to further improve the recovery performance. Comprehensive experiments of the scene recovery illustrate that our method outperforms competitively several state-of-the-art imaging methods in terms of efficiency and robustness.

ID RECOGNITION; ATTENTION
AB Adversarial attacks can easily fool object recognition systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Although many defense methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them can still be adaptively evaded. One reason for the weak adversarial robustness may be that DNNs are only supervised by category labels and do not have part-based inductive bias like the recognition process of humans. Inspired by a well-known theory in cognitive psychology - recognition-by-components, we propose a novel object recognition model ROCK (Recognizing Object by Components with human prior Knowledge). It first segments parts of objects from images, then scores part segmentation results with predefined human prior knowledge, and finally outputs prediction based on the scores. The first stage of ROCK corresponds to the process of decomposing objects into parts in human vision. The second stage corresponds to the decision process of the human brain. ROCK shows better robustness than classical recognition models across various attack settings. These results encourage researchers to rethink the rationality of currently widely-used DNN-based object recognition models and explore the potential of part-based models, once important but recently ignored, for improving robustness.

   super-resolution
AB Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image or video by introducing an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g., scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g., HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C-2-Matching in this work, which performs explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) To bridge the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) To address the resolution gap, we adopt teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue between input images and reference images. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Reference-based Image Super-Resolution (Ref Image SR) under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. We also extend C-2-Matching to Reference-based Video Super-Resolution (Ref VSR) task, where an image taken in a similar scene serves as the HR reference image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C-2-Matching significantly outperforms state of the arts by up to 0.7 dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark and also boosts the performance of video super-resolution by incorporating the C-2-Matching component into Video SR pipelines. Notably, C-2-Matching also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as robustness across large scale and rotation transformations.

   out-of-distribution detection; shannon entropy
AB In deep neural learning, a discriminator trained on in-distribution (ID) samples may make high-confidence predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. This triggers a significant matter for robust, trustworthy and safe deep learning. The issue is primarily caused by the limited ID samples observable in training the discriminator when OOD samples are unavailable. We propose a general approach for fine-tuning discriminators by implicit generators (FIG). FIG is grounded on information theory and applicable to standard discriminators without retraining. It improves the ability of a standard discriminator in distinguishing ID and OOD samples by generating and penalizing its specific OOD samples. According to the Shannon entropy, an energy-based implicit generator is inferred from a discriminator without extra training costs. Then, a Langevin dynamic sampler draws specific OOD samples for the implicit generator. Lastly, we design a regularizer fitting the design principle of the implicit generator to induce high entropy on those generated OOD samples. The experiments on different networks and datasets demonstrate that FIG achieves the state-of-the-art OOD detection performance.

AB 3D indoor scenes are widely used in computer graphics, with applications ranging from interior design to gaming to virtual and augmented reality. They also contain rich information, including room layout, as well as furniture type, geometry, and placement. High-quality 3D indoor scenes are highly demanded while it requires expertise and is time-consuming to design high-quality 3D indoor scenes manually. Existing research only addresses partial problems: some works learn to generate room layout, and other works focus on generating detailed structure and geometry of individual furniture objects. However, these partial steps are related and should be addressed together for optimal synthesis. We propose SCENEHGN, a hierarchical graph network for 3D indoor scenes that takes into account the full hierarchy from the room level to the object level, then finally to the object part level. Therefore for the first time, our method is able to directly generate plausible 3D room content, including furniture objects with fine-grained geometry, and their layout. To address the challenge, we introduce functional regions as intermediate proxies between the room and object levels to make learning more manageable. To ensure plausibility, our graph-based representation incorporates both vertical edges connecting child nodes with parent nodes from different levels, and horizontal edges encoding relationships between nodes at the same level. Our generation network is a conditional recursive neural network (RvNN) based variational autoencoder (VAE) that learns to generate detailed content with fine-grained geometry for a room, given the room boundary as the condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ourmethod produces superior generation results, even when comparing results of partial steps with alternative methods that can only achieve these. We also demonstrate that our method is effective for various applications such as part-level room editing, room interpolation, and room generation by arbitrary room boundaries.

DE Generative adversarial networks; image synthesis; data augmentation;
   few-shot image-to-image translation
AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) typically suffer from overfitting when limited training data is available. To facilitate GAN training, current methods propose to use data-specific augmentation techniques. Despite the effectiveness, it is difficult for these methods to scale to practical applications. In this article, we present ScoreMix, a novel and scalable data augmentation approach for various image synthesis tasks. We first produce augmented samples using the convex combinations of the real samples. Then, we optimize the augmented samples by minimizing the norms of the data scores, i.e., the gradients of the log-density functions. This procedure enforces the augmented samples close to the data manifold. To estimate the scores, we train a deep estimation network with multi-scale score matching. For different image synthesis tasks, we train the score estimation network using different data. We do not require the tuning of the hyperparameters or modifications to the network architecture. The ScoreMix method effectively increases the diversity of data and reduces the overfitting problem. Moreover, it can be easily incorporated into existing GAN models with minor modifications. Experimental results on numerous tasks demonstrate that GAN models equipped with the ScoreMix method achieve significant improvements.

   sampling; stochastic complementary strategy
AB Searching for a more compact network width recently serves as an effective way of channel pruning for the deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under hardware constraints. To fulfil the searching, a one-shot supernet is usually leveraged to efficiently evaluate the performance w.r.t. different network widths. However, current methods mainly follow a unilaterally augmented (UA) principle for the evaluation of each width, which induces the training unfairness of channels in supernet. In this article, we introduce a new supernet called Bilaterally Coupled Network (BCNet) to address this issue. In BCNet, each channel is fairly trained and responsible for the same amount of network widths, thus each network width can be evaluated more accurately. Besides, we propose to reduce the redundant search space and present the BCNetV2 as the enhanced supernet to ensure rigorous training fairness over channels. Furthermore, we leverage a stochastic complementary strategy for training the BCNet, and propose a prior initial population sampling method to boost the performance of the evolutionary search. We also propose a new open-source width search benchmark on macro structures named Channel-Bench-Macro for the better comparisons of the width search algorithmswith MobileNet- and ResNet-like architectures. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TI Self-Adversarial Disentangling for Specific Domain Adaptation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Autonomous driving; domain adaptation; feature disentangling;
   representation learning; scene understanding
AB Domain adaptation aims to bridge the domain shifts between the source and the target domain. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog, rainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior knowledge about the domain shifts on a specific dimension, thus leading to less desired adaptation performance. In this article, we study a practical setting called Specific Domain Adaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target domains in a demanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the intra-domain gap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of domain shifts in this dimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain. To address the problem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD) framework. In particular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the source domain by introducing a domainness creator with providing additional supervisory signals. Guided by the created domainness, we design a self-adversarial regularizer and two loss functions to jointly disentangle the latent representations into domainness-specific and domainness-invariant features, thus mitigating the intra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken as a plug-and-play framework and does not introduce any extra costs in the inference time. We achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-artmethods in both object detection and semantic segmentation.

DE Depth estimation; dataset; high fidelity human reconstruction; normal
   estimation; single view 3D reconstruction; self-supervised learning
AB A key challenge of learning a visual representation for the 3D high fidelity geometry of dressed humans lies in the limited availability of the ground truth data (e.g., 3D scanned models), which results in the performance degradation of 3D human reconstruction when applying to real-world imagery. We address this challenge by leveraging a new data resource: a number of social media dance videos that span diverse appearance, clothing styles, performances, and identities. Each video depicts dynamic movements of the body and clothes of a single person while lacking the 3D ground truth geometry. To learn a visual representation from these videos, we present a new self-supervised learning method to use the local transformation that warps the predicted local geometry of the person from an image to that of another image at a different time instant. This allows self-supervision by enforcing a temporal coherence over the predictions. In addition, we jointly learn the depths along with the surface normals that are highly responsive to local texture, wrinkle, and shade by maximizing their geometric consistency. Our method is end-to-end trainable, resulting in high fidelity depth estimation that predicts fine geometry faithful to the input real image. We further provide a theoretical bound of self-supervised learning via an uncertainty analysis that characterizes the performance of the self-supervised learning without training. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art human depth estimation and human shape recovery approaches on both real and rendered images.

ID IMAGE; ENHANCEMENT
AB Capturing videos under the extremely dark environment is quite challenging for the extremely large and complex noise. To accurately represent the complex noise distribution, the physics-based noise modeling and learning-based blind noise modeling methods are proposed. However, these methods suffer from either the requirement of complex calibration procedure or performance degradation in practice. In this paper, we propose a semi-blind noise modeling and enhancing method, which incorporates the physics-based noise model with a learning-based Noise Analysis Module (NAM). With NAM, self-calibration of model parameters can be realized, which enables the denoising process to be adaptive to various noise distributions of either different cameras or camera settings. Besides, we develop a recurrent Spatio-Temporal Large-span Network (STLNet), constructed with a Slow-Fast Dual-branch (SFDB) architecture and an Interframe Non-local Correlation Guidance (INCG) mechanism, to fully investigate the spatio-temporal correlation in a large span. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated with extensive experiments, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

TI SePiCo: Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast for Domain Adaptive Semantic
   Segmentation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; semantic segmentation; semantic variations;
   representation learning; self-training
AB Domain adaptive semantic segmentation attempts to make satisfactory dense predictions on an unlabeled target domain by utilizing the supervised model trained on a labeled source domain. One popular solution is self-training, which retrains the model with pseudo labels on target instances. Plenty of approaches tend to alleviate noisy pseudo labels, however, they ignore the intrinsic connection of the training data, i.e., intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion between pixel representations across and within domains. In consequence, they struggle to handle cross-domain semantic variations and fail to build a well-structured embedding space, leading to less discrimination and poor generalization. In this work, we propose Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast (SePiCo), a novel one-stage adaptation framework that highlights the semantic concepts of individual pixels to promote learning of class-discriminative and class-balanced pixel representations across domains, eventually boosting the performance of self-training methods. Specifically, to explore proper semantic concepts, we first investigate a centroid-aware pixel contrast that employs the category centroids of the entire source domain or a single source image to guide the learning of discriminative features. Considering the possible lack of category diversity in semantic concepts, we then blaze a trail of distributional perspective to involve a sufficient quantity of instances, namely distribution-aware pixel contrast, inwhich we approximate the true distribution of each semantic category from the statistics of labeled source data. Moreover, such an optimization objective can derive a closed-form upper bound by implicitly involving an infinite number of (dis)similar pairs, making it computationally efficient. Extensive experiments show that SePiCo not only helps stabilize training but also yields discriminative representations, making significant progress on both synthetic-to-real and daytime-to-nighttime adaptation scenarios. The code and models are available at https://github.com/BITDA/SePiCo.

TI SIGMA plus plus : Improved Semantic-Complete Graph Matching for Domain
   Adaptive Object Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Class conditional distribution; domain adaptive object detection;
   hypergraph matching; prototypes
AB Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) generalizes the object detector from an annotated domain to a labelfree novel one. Recent works estimate prototypes (class centers) and minimize the corresponding distances to adapt the cross-domain class conditional distribution. However, this prototype-based paradigm 1) fails to capture the class variance with agnostic structural dependencies, and 2) ignores the domain-mismatched classes with a sub-optimal adaptation. To address these two challenges, we propose an improved SemantIc-completeGraph MAtching framework, dubbed SIGMA++, for DAOD, completing mismatched semantics and reformulating adaptationwith hypergraph matching. Specifically, we propose a Hypergraphical Semantic Completion (HSC) module to generate hallucination graph nodes in mismatched classes. HSC builds a cross-image hypergraph to model class conditional distribution with high-order dependencies and learns a graph-guided memory bank to generate missing semantics. After representing the source and target batch with hypergraphs, we reformulate domain adaptation with a hypergraphmatching problem, i.e., discovering well-matched nodes with homogeneous semantics to reduce the domain gap, which is solved with a Bipartite Hypergraph Matching (BHM) module. Graph nodes are used to estimate semantic-aware affinity, while edges serve as high-order structural constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with hypergraph matching. The applicability of various object detectors verifies the generalization of SIGMA++, and extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show its state-of-the-art performance on both AP(50) and adaptation gains.

   world; robustness; security; traffic sign recognition
AB Adversarial patch is an important form of real-world adversarial attack that brings serious risks to the robustness of deep neural networks. Previous methods generate adversarial patches by either optimizing their perturbation values while fixing the pasting position or manipulating the position while fixing the patch's content. This reveals that the positions and perturbations are both important to the adversarial attack. For that, in this article, we propose a novel method to simultaneously optimize the position and perturbation for an adversarial patch, and thus obtain a high attack success rate in the black-box setting. Technically, we regard the patch's position, the pre-designed hyper-parameters to determine the patch's perturbations as the variables, and utilize the reinforcement learning framework to simultaneously solve for the optimal solution based on the rewards obtained from the target model with a small number of queries. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Face Recognition (FR) task, and results on four representative FR models show that our method can significantly improve the attack success rate and query efficiency. Besides, experiments on the commercial FR service and physical environments confirm its practical application value. We also extend our method to the traffic sign recognition task to verify its generalization ability.

ID MODEL
AB Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures multiple sequential video frames by a single measurement using the idea of computational imaging. The underlying principle is to modulate high-speed frames through different masks and these modulated frames are summed to a single measurement captured by a low-speed 2D sensor (dubbed optical encoder); following this, algorithms are employed to reconstruct the desired high-speed frames (dubbed software decoder) if needed. In this article, we consider the reconstruction algorithm in video SCI, i.e., recovering a series of video frames from a compressed measurement. Specifically, we propose a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) to exploit the correlation in both spatial and temporal domains. STFormer network is composed of a token generation block, a video reconstruction block, and these two blocks are connected by a series of STFormer blocks. Each STFormer block consists of a spatial self-attention branch, a temporal self-attention branch and the outputs of these two branches are integrated by a fusion network. Extensive results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of STFormer. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/ucaswangls/STFormer.

AB Leakage of data from publicly available Machine Learning (ML) models is an area of growing significance since commercial and government applications of ML can draw on multiple sources of data, potentially including users' and clients' sensitive data. We provide a comprehensive survey of contemporary advances on several fronts, covering involuntary data leakage which is natural to ML models, potential malicious leakage which is caused by privacy attacks, and currently available defence mechanisms. We focus on inference-time leakage, as the most likely scenario for publicly available models. We first discuss what leakage is in the context of different data, tasks, and model architectures. We then propose a taxonomy across involuntary and malicious leakage, followed by description of currently available defences, assessment metrics, and applications. We conclude with outstanding challenges and open questions, outlining some promising directions for future research.

TI Task-Aware Weakly Supervised Object Localization With Transformer
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DE Weakly supervised object localization; task-aware; transformer
AB Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to predict both object locations and categories with only image-level class labels. However, most existing methods rely on class-specific image regions for localization, resulting in incomplete object localization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel end-to-end task-aware framework with a transformer encoder-decoder architecture (TAFormer) to learn class-agnostic foreground maps, including a representation encoder, a localization decoder, and a classification decoder. The proposed TAFormer enjoys several merits. First, the designed three modules can effectively perform class-agnostic localization and classification in a task-aware manner, achieving remarkable performance for both tasks. Second, an optimal transport algorithm is proposed to provide pixel-level pseudo labels to online refine foreground maps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work by exploring a task-aware framework with a transformer architecture and an optimal transport algorithm to achieve accurate object localization for WSOL. Extensive experiments with four backbones on two standard benchmarks demonstrate that our TAFormer achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that the proposed TAFormer provides higher robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy labels.

DE Style disentanglement; style transfer; text generation
AB We present a novel approach for disentangling the content of a text image from all aspects of its appearance. The appearance representation we derive can then be applied to new content, for one-shot transfer of the source style to new content. We learn this disentanglement in a self-supervised manner. Our method processes entire word boxes, without requiring segmentation of text from background, per-character processing, or making assumptions on string lengths. We show results in different text domains which were previously handled by specialized methods, e.g., scene text, handwritten text. To these ends, we make a number of technical contributions: (1) We disentangle the style and content of a textual image into a non-parametric, fixed-dimensional vector. (2) We propose a novel approach inspired by StyleGAN but conditioned over the example style at different resolution and content. (3) We present novel self-supervised training criteria which preserve both source style and target content using a pre-trained font classifier and text recognizer. Finally, (4) we also introduce Imgur5K, a new challenging dataset for handwritten word images. We offer numerous qualitative photo-realistic results of our method. We further show that our method surpasses previous work in quantitative tests on scene text and handwriting datasets, as well as in a user study.

TI Towards Lightweight Pixel-Wise Hallucination for Heterogeneous Face
   Recognition

DE Heterogeneous face recognition; cross-spectral face hallucination
ID SPECTRAL REGRESSION
AB Cross-spectral face hallucination is an intuitive way to mitigate the modality discrepancy in Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR). However, due to imaging differences, the hallucination inevitably suffers from a shape misalignment between paired heterogeneous images. Rather than building complicated architectures to circumvent the problem like previous works, we propose a simple yet effective method called Shape Alignment FacE (SAFE). Specifically, given an image, we align its shape to that of the paired one under the assistance of a 3D face model. The produced aligned pair enables us to train a lightweight generator that solely concentrates on spectrum translation with a pixel-wise supervision. However, since the 3D face model is powerless to attributes like the hair and glasses, there are still pixel discrepancies between the aligned pair. Given that, in the image space, we introduce a probabilistic pixel-wise loss that incorporates the discrepancies into a probabilistic distribution. Moreover, in order to alleviate the influence of the shape misalignment on spectrum translation, a spectrum optimal transport is performed in a shape-irrelevant latent space. Note that, in the final inference phase, except the lightweight generator, all other auxiliary modules are discarded. In addition to superior performance in qualitative synthesis and quantitative recognition, extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate that our method also gains other two distinct advantages over existing state-of-the-art counterparts. The first is using a more lightweight generator. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our method can achieve higher recognition results with 128x fewer parameters and 63x fewer FLOPswith only 4.58 ms latency on a single TITAN-XP. The second is training on low-shot datasets such as Oulu-CASIA NIR-VIS that just contains 1,920 images from 20 identities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first that can performwell on such a small-scale dataset. These advantages make our method more practical in the real world and further push boundaries of heterogeneous face recognition.

AB K-means is a fundamental clustering algorithm widely used in both academic and industrial applications. Its popularity can be attributed to its simplicity and efficiency. Studies show the equivalence of K-means to principal component analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. However, these studies focus on standard K-means with squared euclidean distance. In this review paper, we unify the available approaches in generalizing K-means to solve challenging and complex problems. We show that these generalizations can be seen from four aspects: data representation, distance measure, label assignment, and centroid updating. As concrete applications of transforming problems into modified K-means formulation, we review the following applications: iterative subspace projection and clustering, consensus clustering, constrained clustering, domain adaptation, and outlier detection.

AB Representation learning is the foundation of natural language processing (NLP). This work presents new methods to employ visual information as assistant signals to general NLP tasks. For each sentence, we first retrieve a flexible number of images either from a light topic-image lookup table extracted over the existing sentence-image pairs or a shared cross-modal embedding space that is pre-trained on out-of-shelf text-image pairs. Then, the text and images are encoded by a Transformer encoder and convolutional neural network, respectively. The two sequences of representations are further fused by an attention layer for the interaction of the two modalities. In this study, the retrieval process is controllable and flexible. The universal visual representation overcomes the lack of large-scale bilingual sentence-image pairs. Our method can be easily applied to text-only tasks without manually annotated multimodal parallel corpora. We apply the proposed method to a wide range of natural language generation and understanding tasks, including neural machine translation, natural language inference, and semantic similarity. Experimental results show that our method is generally effective for different tasks and languages. Analysis indicates that the visual signals enrich textual representations of content words, provide fine-grained grounding information about the relationship between concepts and events, and potentially conduce to disambiguation.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking is of great significance for a wide range of applications, such as delivery and agriculture. Previous benchmarks in this area mainly focused on small-scale tracking problems while ignoring the amounts of data, types of data modalities, diversities of target categories and scenarios, and evaluation protocols involved, greatly hiding the massive power of deep UAV tracking. In this article, we propose WebUAV-3M, the largest public UAV tracking benchmark to date, to facilitate both the development and evaluation of deep UAV trackers. WebUAV-3M contains over 3.3 million frames across 4,500 videos and offers 223 highly diverse target categories. Each video is densely annotated with bounding boxes by an efficient and scalable semi-automatic target annotation (SATA) pipeline. Importantly, to take advantage of the complementary superiority of language and audio, we enrich WebUAV-3M by innovatively providing both natural language specifications and audio descriptions. We believe that such additions will greatly boost future research in terms of exploring language features and audio cues for multi-modal UAV tracking. In addition, a fine-grained UAV tracking-under-scenario constraint (UTUSC) evaluation protocol and seven challenging scenario subtest sets are constructed to enable the community to develop, adapt and evaluate various types of advanced trackers. We provide extensive evaluations and detailed analyses of 43 representative trackers and envision future research directions in the field of deep UAV tracking and beyond. The dataset, toolkits, and baseline results are available at https://github.com/983632847/WebUAV-3M.

AB This article presents a generic probabilistic framework for estimating the statistical dependency and finding the anatomical correspondences among an arbitrary number of medical images. The method builds on a novel formulation of the N-dimensional joint intensity distribution by representing the common anatomy as latent variables and estimating the appearance model with nonparametric estimators. Through connection to maximum likelihood and the expectation-maximization algorithm, an information-theoretic metric called X-metric and a co-registration algorithm named X-CoReg are induced, allowing groupwise registration of the N observed images with computational complexity of O(N). Moreover, the method naturally extends for a weakly-supervised scenario where anatomical labels of certain images are provided. This leads to a combined-computing framework implemented with deep learning, which performs registration and segmentation simultaneously and collaboratively in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments were conducted to demonstrate the versatility and applicability of our model, including multimodal groupwise registration, motion correction for dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images, and deep combined computing for multimodal medical images. Results show the superiority of our method in various applications in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the advantage of the proposed representation of the imaging process.

AB Batch normalization (BN) is a fundamental unit in modern deep neural networks. However, BN and its variants focus on normalization statistics but neglect the recovery step that uses linear transformation to improve the capacity of fitting complex data distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the recovery step can be improved by aggregating the neighborhood of each neuron rather than just considering a single neuron. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method named batch normalization with enhanced linear transformation (BNET) to embed spatial contextual information and improve representation ability. BNET can be easily implemented using the depth-wise convolution and seamlessly transplanted into existing architectures with BN. To our best knowledge, BNET is the first attempt to enhance the recovery step for BN. Furthermore, BN is interpreted as a special case of BNET from both spatial and spectral views. Experimental results demonstrate that BNET achieves consistent performance gains based on various backbones in a wide range of visual tasks. Moreover, BNET can accelerate the convergence of network training and enhance spatial information by assigning important neurons with large weights accordingly.

AB Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is an easy-to-use supervised dimensionality reduction method. However, LDA may be ineffective against complicated class distributions. It is well-known that deep feedforward neural networks with rectified linear units as activation functions can map many input neighborhoods to similar outputs by a succession of space-folding operations. This short paper shows that the space-folding operation can reveal to LDA classification information in the subspace where LDA cannot find any. A composition of LDA with the space-folding operation can find classification information more than LDA can do. End-to-end fine-tuning can improve that composition further. Experimental results on artificial and open data sets have shown the feasibility of the proposed approach.

TI Reducing Spatial Labeling Redundancy for Active Semi-Supervised Crowd

   semi-supervised learning; spatial labeling redundancy
AB Labeling is onerous for crowd counting as it should annotate each individual in crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for semi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited labeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all individuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the None-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals in each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd images may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to break the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to reduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First, instead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to annotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness from both vertical and horizontal directions of initially estimated density maps, and formulate them as cluster centers of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich unlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd image to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation instead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods. In this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by individual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled regions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.

AB Annotating object boundaries by humans demands high costs. Recently, polygon-based annotation methods with human interaction have shown successful performance. However, given the connected vertex topology, these methods exhibit difficulty predicting the disconnected components in an object. This article introduces Split-GCN, a novel architecture based on the polygon approach and self-attention mechanism. By offering the direction information, Split-GCN enables the polygon's vertices to move more precisely to the object boundary. Our model successfully predicts disconnected components of an object by transforming the initial topology using the context exchange about the dependencies of vertices. Split-GCN demonstrates competitive performance with the state-of-the-art models on Cityscapes and even higher performance with the baseline models. On four cross-domain datasets, we confirm our model's generalization ability.

AB In this work, an adaptive control strategy is proposed for simultaneous tracking and stabilization of nonholonomic mobile robot with uncertainties. The tracking controller is consisted of two subcontrollers: position controller and direction angle controller. The hyperbolic tangent function is employed to design the position control law, and the adaptive laws of the uncertainties are obtained by Lyapunov direct method, so as to guarantee the global stability of the tracking controller. An adaptive sliding mode controller is designed for control of the direction angle, and the influence of direction angle error on the stability of the position tracking system is considered. By adjusting the control gain coefficients of the two control subsystems, the convergence speed of the direction angle control subsystem is far greater than that of the position control subsystem, so as to assure the asymptotic convergence of the whole robot control system. Furthermore, the stabilization problem is converted into an equivalent tracking problem through the selection of appropriate reference velocities. The asymptotic convergence of pose errors for mobile robot is proved by the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulations and experiments are carried out to verify that the designed control method can simultaneously handle the problems of trajectory tracking and stabilization of mobile robot.

ID ACTIVE FIRE DETECTION
AB Wildfires are a common problem in many areas of the world with often catastrophic consequences. A number of systems have been created to provide early warnings of wildfires, including those that use satellite data to detect fires. The increased availability of small satellites, such as CubeSats, allows the wildfire detection response time to be reduced by deploying constellations of multiple satellites over regions of interest. By using machine learned components on-board the satellites, constraints which limit the amount of data that can be processed and sent back to ground stations can be overcome. There are hazards associated with wildfire alert systems, such as failing to detect the presence of a wildfire, or detecting a wildfire in the incorrect location. It is therefore necessary to be able to create a safety assurance case for the wildfire alert ML component that demonstrates it is sufficiently safe for use. This paper describes in detail how a safety assurance case for an ML wildfire alert system is created. This represents the first fully developed safety case for an ML component containing explicit argument and evidence as to the safety of the machine learning.

AB The original adjoint error model is a complete, continuous, and minimal calibration model. However, the original model is defective in its mathematical derivation, and the method of updating kinematic parameters is also complicated and indirect; meanwhile, the orientation measurement of the end-effector is very difficult to implement. To address these problems, we present a complete and unified model for robot calibration based on an improved adjoint error model, in which only the position measurements of the end-effector are required. In addition, a compensation algorithm is proposed to improve the robot position accuracy using the calibration results; the proposed algorithm does not require modification of the kinematic parameters of the robot controller and can be applied to robots with different degrees of freedom. Simulations on a PUMA560 robot and a SCARA robot were performed to validate our algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithms were applied to our self-designed modular robots with four and six degrees of freedom. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the robots is enhanced by approximately one order of magnitude after compensation.

AB This paper introduces the design, dynamic model, and impedance control of a novel five degrees of freedom (DOF) double-driven parallel mechanism (DDPM) for the task of grinding aircraft composite skin. Firstly, a novel parallel mechanism consisting of one PUU (P-active prismatic pairs, U-universal joints) limb and two PRRS (R-revolution joints, R-active revolution joints, S-spherical joints) limbs (PUU-2PRRS) is proposed. Secondly, considering the particularity of the sub-closed loop structure of the mechanism, the dynamic model of the proposed PUU-2PRRS parallel mechanism is established based on closed loop vector and Lagrange methods, and then the correctness of the established dynamic model is proved by the comparative analysis of MATLAB and Adams software. Thirdly, an adaptive impedance control law with switching update rate is proposed to achieve constant force tracking in uncertain environments. Considering that the composite skin grinding task requires low maximum overshoot and high convergence speed of force tracking, the selection methods of the update rate are obtained based on the maximum overshoot and convergence speed analysis in frequency domain. Finally, by simulating different working conditions of composite skin grinding, the adaptive impedance control under switching update rate has better force tracking performance compared with the adaptive impedance control under fixed update rate, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK
AB Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) is regarded as the process of improving the image quality of low-resolution scene text images to improve text recognition accuracy. Recently, a text attention network was introduced to reconstruct high-resolution scene text images; the backbone method involved the convolutional neural network-based and transformer-based architecture. Although it can deal with rotated and curved-shaped texts, it still cannot properly handle images containing improper-shaped texts and blurred text regions. This can lead to incorrect text predictions during the text recognition step. In this study, we propose the application of multiple parametric regularizations and parametric weight parameters to the loss function of the STISR method to improve scene text image quality and text recognition accuracy. We design and extend it into three types of methods: adding multiple parametric regularizations, modifying parametric weight parameters, and combining parametric weights and multiple parametric regularizations. Experiments were conducted and compared with state-of-the-art models. The results showed a significant improvement for every proposed method. Moreover, our methods generated clearer and sharper edges than the baseline with a better-quality image score.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Deep Learning predictions with measurable confidence are increasingly desirable for real-world problems, especially in high-risk settings. The Conformal Prediction (CP) framework is a versatile solution that guarantees a maximum error rate given minimal constraints [1]. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal loss function that approximates the traditionally two-step CP approach in a single step. By evaluating and penalising deviations from the stringent expected CP output distribution, a Deep Learning model may learn the direct relationship between the input data and the conformal p-values. We carry out a comprehensive empirical evaluation to show our novel loss function's competitiveness for seven binary and multi-class prediction tasks on five benchmark datasets. On the same datasets, our approach achieves significant training time reductions up to 86% compared to Aggregated Conformal Prediction (ACP, [2]), while maintaining comparable approximate validity and predictive efficiency.

AB In supervised learning, the Universum, a third class that is not a part of either class in the classification task, has proven to be useful. In this study we propose (NUTBSVM), a Newton based approach for solving in the primal space the optimization problems related to Twin Bounded Support Vector Machines with Universum data (UTBSVM). In the NUTBSVM, the constrained programming problems of UTBSVM are converted into unconstrained optimization problems, and a generalization of Newton's method for solving the unconstrained problems is introduced. Numerical experiments on synthetic, UCI, and NDC data sets show the ability and effectiveness of the proposed NUTBSVM. We apply the suggested method for gender detection from face images, and compare it with other methods.

AB To accurately segment subcortical structures and therefore profit for numerous neuroimaging applications, we proposed a multi-atlas subcortical segmentation method by orchestrating a 3D fully convolutional network and a generalized mixture function. Template atlases were first aligned to the target image. Then, target image patches and several most similar atlas patches were extracted from the transformed template atlases by employing a proposed similar atlas selection network and fed into the proposed multi-atlas driven 3D fully convolutional neural network. To sufficiently extract the subcortical features and improve the segmentation performance, a restricted region thought as a bounding box was utilized to roughly locate the subcortical structures. Additionally, a generalized mixture function was introduced to reduce the impact of the size and stride in 3D patch extraction. Two datasets consisting of 16 and 18 T1-weighted magnetic resonance images images (MRIs) were included to evaluate the proposed method, respectively. The results showed significantly higher segmentation accuracy than several state-of-the-art subcortical segmentation approaches for most subcortical structures. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved notable higher mean Dice similarity coefficients being, respectively, 0.915 and 0.869. The proposed method automatically and accurately segments subcortical structures in MRIs, which may assist the artificial diagnosis of brain disorders.

AB In this paper, a distributed leaderless consensus control problem is investigated for uncertain multiagent systems (MASs) with event-triggered (ET) communication and disturbances. To economize the limited communication resources, two ET mechanisms are employed in the controller-to-actuator channel and communication channel respectively. In the controller-to-actuator channel, a novel switching ET mechanism is developed, where the agents can choose the ET strategies arbitrarily in a unified control framework by adjusting a switching parameter. In the communication channel, an improved filter composed of only triggered output signals is presented, which can avoid the transmission of multiple signals between agents and reduce the dispensable data transmission effectively. In the designed filter-based backstepping control framework, the parameter estimation technique is employed to deal with unmatched uncertainties and disturbances problems for high-order nonlinear MASs. By applying the Lyapunov stability method, it is proved that the outputs of agents can reach a leaderless consensus, and the stability of the closed-loop system can be guaranteed. Finally, two simulation examples demonstrate that the proposed control strategy is effective.

AB Few-shot object detection has been widely applied in industrial applications, endangered detection, tumor lesion detection, etc. Although many excellent few-shot detection models have been proposed recently, intra-class & inter-class confusion and low activation of novel classes still keep few-shot detection challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot detection model ITFD, in which a weighted pair-resampling method improves the localization efficiency of the novel-class and a hard triplet loss reduces intra-class & inter-class confusion are contained. Extensive experiments have shown that our model achieves 3.6%, 2.6%, and 3.7% average nAP50 improvement on novel-class setup 1,2,3 of PASCAL VOC compared to the same one-time fine-tuning type of models. Besides, to verify the effectiveness of our model in practical application, we established two train component detection datasets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets with an average nAP50 improvement of 7% and 4.8% respectively.

AB Pediatric bone age assessment (BAA) is an essential human physiological examination that reflects human growth potential and sexual maturation trends. In clinical practice, the "Methodology for Bone Maturation and Evaluation of the Wrist in Chinese Adolescent Children" (CHN-05) is a widely used method for BAA by Chinese radiologists. CHN-05 adopts the metacarpal length (ML) as well as the metacarpal margin (MM) as reference standards to estimate bone age. Inspired by the semantic description of CHN-05, we propose a new model, called a topology and edge map composed of a network(TENet), for automatic bone age assessment. In TENet, we design a hand topology module to recognize key hand locations and extract structural semantics. In addition, we devise an edge feature enhancement module to supply precise skeletal edge information throughout the training process. Our model can detect the overall message of edges alongside the local message of topology for the purpose of multi-feature horizontally fused assessment of bone age. Experimental results show that our TENet achieves a state-of-the-art model performance of 5.35 mean absolute error (MAE) on the public dataset RSNA. Since our model for designing follows CHN-05 semantic logic, it is reliable and interpretable in terms of clinical use.

AB Despite the public availability of legal documents, there is a need for finding specific information contained in them, such as paragraphs, clauses, items and so on. With such support, users could find more specific information than only finding whole legal documents. Some research efforts have been made in this area, but there is still a lot to be done to have legal information available more easily to be found. Thus, due to the large number of published legal documents and the high degree of connectivity, simple access to the document is not enough. It is necessary to recover the related legal framework for a specific need. In other words, the retrieval of the set of legal documents and their parts related to a specific subject is necessary. Therefore, in this work, we present a proposal of a RDF-based graph to represent and search parts of legal documents, as the output of a set of terms that represents the pursued legal information. Such a proposal is well-grounded on an ontological view, which makes possible to describe the general structure of a legal system and the structure of legal documents, providing this way the grounds for the implementation of the proposed RDF graph in terms of the meaning of their parts and relationships. We posed several queries to retrieve parts of legal documents related to sets of words and the results were significant.

TI Multi-source deep transfer learning algorithm based on feature alignment
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW

DT Article
DE Multi-source transfer learning; Feature alignment; Classification
AB With the deepening of transfer learning research, researchers are no longer satisfied with the classification of knowledge in a single field but hope that the classification of knowledge in multiple fields can be realized, so as to simulate the behavior of human "analogy" and enable the machine to draw inferences". However, the feature realization of multiple source domains often differs greatly, which brings a challenge to the traditional transfer learning scheme. In this paper, a multi-source deep transfer learning algorithm MDTLFA based on feature alignment is proposed to solve the problem that the data from multiple source domains often has different feature realizations. MDTLFA first reduces the difference in the marginal probability distribution between fields at the sample level by means of the maximum mean deviation MMD. Then, the feature alignment strategy is used at the feature level to further reduce the difference in the marginal probability distribution between the fields and maintain the unique data manifold structure while sharing similar features. On this basis, the conditional probability adaptation CPDA was constructed to reduce the difference in conditional probability distribution between domains and enhance the portability of source domain features. The CPTCNN model was constructed based on a convolutional neural network using CPDA. Finally, the CPTCNN model is trained in the subspace to obtain a classifier set, and the designed strategy is used to select the classifier with a small classification error in the target domain to form MDTLFA. Multiple source domains, marginal probability adaptation at the sample level and feature level, and the CPTCNN model constructed based on the minimization of conditional probability differences effectively improve the performance of data features in multiple domains, thus improving the classification effect. The experimental results on several real data sets show that the MDTLFA algorithm is effective and has some advantages compared with the advanced benchmark algorithm.

AB An institution's academic buildings are an important meeting point for students, and the crowd flow affects its ecological parameters. Therefore, it is necessary to measure the ecological parameters and crowd flow in such a building. Tracking the density of large-scale people and environmental parameters is a challenging task. In this study, a lightweight smartphone-based crowd flow measurement (SP-SP-CFM) is introduced for tracking the crowd flow in academic buildings. The proposed SP-CFM searches the requests enabled by the user's smartphone at regular intervals. SP-CFM has been implemented, and a different test has been carried out in the academic building in real-world settings. The SP-CFM was deployed in different locations, including the evacuation passage on the first floor and two classrooms. The ecological parameters, such as temperature and CO2 concentration, have been studied at different locations in the evacuation passage. The effect of people's walking behaviour has been studied in four different modes of smartphone operation. The performance of the suggested SP-CFM is evaluated with different models of smartphones with variable walking speeds. The results show the proposed SP-CFM provides a tracking accuracy of 93.6% in the Wi-Fi registered mode.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE; CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT
AB Image segmentation of heterogeneous comparable objects lying beneath the earth's surface is a fundamental but challenging research area in remote sensing. Learning approaches are used in remote sensing image segmentation to improve segmentation accuracy at the expense of time and a large amount of data, but their performance need to be finely classified due to information diversity constraints. In this work, we proposed an novel feature based fuzzy C-means-extreme learning machine (FBFCM-ELM) algorithm for remote sensing image segmentation in which the classification based on entropy, intensity, and edge features is performed in such a way that it updates the intensity value to preserve the most local characteristics in the image while still being able to clearly distinguish the image's boundaries by assigning the pixel values of each cluster to the peak value of the cluster's sub-histogram. Using FBFCM, features are extracted and used as reliable samples for ELM training. Undetermined segmented pixels are obtained using the trained ELM classifier. Experiments performed over number of images that confirmed the proposed method yields a better segmented RGB image, as evidenced by observable details, edges, and improved appearance that resembles the ground truth image and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Modeling energy systems is important to generate a range of insights and analyses to improve energy efficiency. However, some details are missing in most end-use models for industrial systems, which has a profound effect on energy modeling for petrochemical plants. In an enterprise-wide optimization conducted in a petrochemical plant, the unit's utility consumptions were modeled and some energy efficiency improvements were observed but with seasonality behaviors that were not appropriately represented and explained. The objective of this study was to obtain a relationship between energy efficiency gains with energy market cost (PLD), electricity demand, room temperature and plant load using the following methods: LRM, ARIMA, and Data Mining, comparing their performance in terms of accuracy and easy-of-use. LRM, despite being more used in the literature, was not applicable, ARIMA had a 67.9% goodness-of-fit, and Data Mining had the best results, with 82.8% and 98.8% goodness-of-fits using the M5P and RandomTree algorithms, respectively. In terms of data visualization, Data Mining is easy with the M5P algorithm, but the RandomTree algorithm has a very extensive regression tree, with 975 rows. The approach can support the organizations to empowerment these employees seeking to handle, store, and analyze all the data available on the company. At the end, the best approach to modelling and better understanding the energy efficiency improvements in a utilities supply on a petrochemical plant was stated as a M5P and its framework can be used to support the decision makers.

ID FISSURES
AB Pulmonary lobe segmentation is an important prerequisite for accurately quantifying pulmonary damage in many pulmonary diseases and planning treatment. However, due to the incomplete lobar structures and morphological changes caused by diseases, the lobe segmentation still encounters great challenges. In this study, a Learnable Interpolation and Extrapolation Network (LIE-Net) is proposed to form complete and consecutive fissure surfaces by learning to extract information of the fissures from existing fissure points and absent points (unsegmented points belonging to fissures) to predict the z coordinate of the absent fissure points. The completed pulmonary fissures are further used for accurate pulmonary lobe segmentation. Specifically, LIE-Net takes the coordinate information of existing fissure points (their (x, y, z) coordinates) and absent fissure points (their (x, y) coordinates) as two independent inputs, and predicts the z coordinates of absent points. The proposed LIE-Net makes voxel-wise predictions based on the spatial structure characteristics of the lung fissure, and is able to provide a consecutive fissure surface in space. According to the evaluation of radiologists, the lobe segmentation performance was remarkably enhanced in approximately 76% of patients in our additional dataset after the application of LIE-Net, especially for those cases with large-scale missing fissures.

DE 3D scene animation; Dynamic knowledge graphs; Contextual encoding;
   Automatic animation generation
AB Although novel 3D animation techniques could be boosted by a large variety of deep learning methods, flexible automatic 3D applications (involving animated figures such as humans and low-life animals) are still rarely studied in 3D computer vision. This is due to lacking of arbitrary 3D data acquisition environment, especially those involving human populated scenes. Given a single image, the 3D animation aided by contextual inference is still plagued by limited reconstruction clues without prior knowledge pertinent to the identified figures/objects and/or their possible relationship w.r.t. the environment. To alleviate such difficulty in time-varying 3D animation, we devise a dynamic scene creation framework via a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG). The DKG encodes both temporal and spatial contextual clues to enable and facilitate human interactions with the affordance environment. Furthermore, we construct the DKG-driven variational auto-encoder (DVAE) upon animation kinematics knowledge conveyed by meta-motion sequences, which are disentangled from videos of prior scenes. It is then possible to utilize the DKG to induce the animations in certain scenes, thus, we could automatically and physically generate plausible 3D animations that afford vivid interactions among humans, low-and life animals in the environment. The extensive experimental results and comprehensive evaluations confirm our DKGs' representation and modeling power towards new animation production in 3D graphics and vision applications.

TI An Optimal Transport View of Class-Imbalanced Visual Recognition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article
DE Optimal transport; Class-imbalanced visual recognition; Adaptive bias
   loss
AB Deep models have achieved impressive success in class-imbalanced visual recognition. In the view of optimal transport, the current evaluation protocol for class-imbalanced visual recognition can be interpreted as follows: during training, the neural network learns an optimal transport mapping with an uneven source label distribution, and during evaluation, this mapping is needed to transfer the instances to the uniform target label distribution. The label distribution's inconsistency leads to poor cross-entropy loss performance. In this paper, we first prove that the cross-entropy loss in the classification network is a smooth approximation to the optimal transport, enhancing the interpretability of the classifier. Motivated by this conclusion, we introduce a simple and effective method named Post Optimal Transport (Post OT). Post OT can match the arbitrary target label distribution, which may also be class-imbalanced by post-processing the predictions of a model. In addition, we propose Adaptive Bias Loss (ABL) based on optimal transport theory to shift the label distribution in the class-imbalanced training, which does not depend on the category frequencies in the training set and also can avoid the overfitting of tail classes. Extensive experiments verify that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places365-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Artificial intelligence methods, based on machine learning models, are rapidly changing financial services, and credit lending in particular, complementing traditional bank lending with platform lending. While financial technologies improve user experience and possibly lower costs, they may increase risks and, in particular, the model risks that derive from inaccurate credit rating assessments. In this paper, we will show how to reduce such model risks, using a S.A.F.E. statistical learning model, which improves: Sustainability, taking environmental, social and governance factors into account; Accuracy, building a model which maximises predictive accuracy; Fairness, merging ESG scores from different data providers, improving their representativeness; Explainability, clarifying the relative contribution of each ESG score to predictive accuracy.

AB One of the key limitations of many existing machine learning approaches is their reliance on large labeled sets. In fact, labeled data are scarce for many applications as it is often expensive and time-consuming to obtain, and sometimes requires expert knowledge. Thus, the development of algorithms that perform well with reduced amounts of labeled data is critical. In this paper, we integrate a semi-supervised framework, a similarity graph-based setting, spectral techniques, optimization-based procedures, and specially designed forcing terms to derive two computationally tractable graph-based algorithms, which are able to obtain accurate predictions at low label rates and small amounts of labeled samples. In particular, we use a general framework involving a semi-implicit alternating scheme for the proposed techniques, and incorporate Poisson and region forcing terms. The proposed methods are very efficient, in part due to the use of spectral procedures and low-dimensional subspaces spanned by only a small number of eigenfunctions. The procedures can also be easily tailored for very large data sets by the use of certain efficient numerical solvers and can incorporate class size information, which often improves accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed methods on a variety of benchmark data sets and compare them favorably to recent existing algorithms.

   High-dimensional data; Parsimonious technique; T-distributed stochastic
   neighbour embedding
AB Cluster-weighted models (CWMs) are an important class of machine learning models that are commonly used for modelling complex datasets. However, they are known to suffer from reduced computing efficiency and estimator accuracy when dealing with high-dimensional data. Previous work has proposed a parsimonious technique that can improve CWMs' performance in the high-dimensional data paradigm. However, this method has a setback for very high-dimensional data, where the dimensionality is greater than 100. In this paper, we propose a new hybridised method that incorporates a dimensionality reduction technique called T-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (TSNE) to enhance the parsimonious CWMs in high-dimensional space. Additionally, we introduce a novel heuristic for detecting the hidden components of the underlying mixture model, which can be used with the popular R package FlexCWM. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method using two real datasets and found that it improves clustering power when compared to both the parsimony methods and the TSNE methods combined with CWMs in the high-dimensional data setting. Our results suggest that the proposed method can improve the efficiency and accuracy of CWMs in dealing with high-dimensional data, making it a valuable tool for data scientists and statisticians.

DE Multi-label feature selection; Neighborhood mutual information; Label
   distribution; Label correlations
ID MUTUAL INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Multi-label feature selection(MFS) has gained in importance, and it is today confronted with the current need to process multi-semantic high-dimensional data. Recent studies usually figure out the MFS problems either simply assume that all associated labels are equally important for each instance; or that the labels are independent of each other. In many real-world applications, however, both cases may occur that the significance of each relevant label is generally different and label correlations are ubiquitous. Based on this observation, we propose a new algorithm, called FSEP, to perform MFS by considering label significance and pairwise label correlations. In FSEP, we first construct a label enhancement method that is able to obtain label distribution and further earn the information of label significance. Then, FSEP explores the influence mechanism of label correlations to features by using neighborhood mutual information and incorporates this influence into the process of feature evaluation. After that, a novel multi-label feature selection strategy, namely, Max-Relevance, Max-Contribution, and Min-Redundancy, is proposed, which achieves a favorable trade-off among feature relevance, the contribution of label correlations to features, and feature redundancy, simultaneously. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets show that the proposed method achieves encouraging results compared with state-of-the-art MFS algorithms.

AB In many real-world applications such as business planning and sensor data monitoring, one important, yet challenging, task is to rank objects (e.g., products, documents, or spatial objects) based on their ranking scores and efficiently return those objects with the highest scores. In practice, due to the unreliability of data sources, many real-world objects often contain noises and are thus imprecise and uncertain. In this paper, we study the problem of probabilistic top-k dominating (PTD) query on such large-scale uncertain data in a distributed environment, which retrieves k uncertain objects from distributed uncertain databases (on multiple distributed servers), having the largest ranking scores with high confidences. In order to efficiently tackle the distributed PTD problem, we propose a MapReduce framework for processing distributed PTD queries over distributed uncertain databases. In this MapReduce framework, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms in the distributed setting, propose cost-model-based index distribution mechanisms over servers, and develop efficient distributed PTD query processing algorithms. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed distributed PTD approaches on both real and synthetic data sets through various experimental settings.

AB Dementia represents one of the great problems to be solved in medicine for a society that is becoming increasingly long-lived. One of the main causes of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for 80% of cases. There is currently no cure for this disease, although there are treatments to try to alleviate its effects, which is why detecting Alzheimer's disease in its early stages is crucial to slow down its evolution and thus help sufferers. One of the symptoms of the disease that manifests in its early stages is apraxia, difficulties in carrying out voluntary movements. In the clinical setting, apraxia is typically assessed by asking the patient to imitate hand gestures that are performed by the examiner. To automate this test, this paper proposes a system that, based on a video of the patient making the gesture, evaluates its execution. This evaluation is done in two steps, first extracting the skeleton of the hands and then using a similarity function to obtain an objective score of the execution of the gesture. The results obtained in an experiment with several patients performing different gestures are shown, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method. The system is intended to serve as a diagnostic tool, enabling medical experts to detect possible mobility impairments in patients that may have signs of Alzheimer's disease.

AB Multi-variate time-series (MTS) forecasting is the prediction of future for a sequence of data. The process of analysing obtained data can benefit the community financially and securely, for instance observing stock exchange trends and predicting malicious attacks whenabout. MTS forecasting models face many problems including data and model complexity, energy constraints and computational cost. These problems could affect budget allocation, latency and carbon emission. Recurrent neural networks are one of these models, which are known for their computational complexity due to slow learning process which requires more energy to train. Contributing to green AI, in this paper, we propose a competitive and energy-efficient lightweight recurrent neural network based on a hybrid neural architecture that combines Random Neural Network (RaNN) and Simple Recurrent Network (SRN), namely Random Simple Recurrent Network (RSRN). We consider RaNN for its distinctive probabilistic properties and SRN for adding lightweight recurrent ability to the RaNN to process sequential data. The paper shows how RSRN is trained using adapted and optimised versions of back propagation (BP), back propagation through time (BPTT) and truncated BPTT (TBPTT). The latter two algorithms use penalised gradient descent to prevent gradient explosion problems by employing the average of total gradient over time. Evaluated on several datasets, RSRN achieves best performance when using TBPTT. Moreover, we performed a comparative study against well-known recurrent models showing its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art models, while requiring much less computational time and training parameters. In addition, we investigated the multi-layer architecture and its properties.

AB Previous knowledge graph-based recommendation models use Graph Neural Networks to aggregate information from neighbors. However, entities of the same hop should have different importance in aggregating, but this is often ignored. To overcome this problem, we try to utilize more helpful information to enhance the recommender system. This paper presents a new recommendation model: Neural Attention Network for Neighborhood Augmented Knowledge Graph (NKGAT). The model is developed based on knowledge graph and graph neural network. In the proposed model, we explore higher-order relationships using embeddings of nodes. Moreover, a new attention module (Neighbor-Augmented Attention (NAA)) is proposed. It assigns proper importance to different entities of neighbors at the same hop in the graph neural network. The experiments are carried out on Movie-Lens, Last-FM, Book-Crossing and Yelp2018 datasets. The experimental results show that NKGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance. It demonstrates that the proposed method integrates rich higher-order information with more proper attention to entities.

TI Prototype Representation Expansion in Incremental Learning

DE Incremental learning; Prototype representation expansion; Non-exemplar
AB Deep neural networks have made outstanding achievements in many static tasks, however, when faced with incremental scenario, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting since the previous data is usually inaccessible. Stored data and generative models are commonly used for maintaining model performance, but there exist problems of memory utilization and privacy safety. In this paper, a novel non-exemplar based incremental learning model, Prototype Representation Expansion (PRE), which provides a great degree to retain the feature space of old tasks, is proposed. Firstly, prototypes are generated to meet the stability and robustness. The mean value of feature embedding for each class is used as prototype to maintain the model stability. Meanwhile, PRE also selects prototypes according to their responses of classifier by feature disturbance noise injection, and the decision boundary can better be maintained. Secondly, prototypes of various classes are linearly combined to construct the hybrid prototype with mixed labels. Along with prototype augmentation, they are used for incremental training phase. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subset. It shows that PRE can be combined with some non-exemplar based methods to significantly improve their ability and achieve comparable performance to exemplar based methods.

AB Accidents of leaks and emissions of flammable, explosive, and toxic substances severely threaten people's health and public safety. Traditional heuristic algorithms for source localization that utilize wind information to guide the robots to search for plumes in the airflow environment, substantial potential plume information is not fully considered, reducing the success rate and precision of source localization. To solve this problem, in this study, we propose a novel strategy for plume source localization using information gain. This strategy is inspired by the navigation and foraging behaviors of the salps in the ocean, and the robots use a mutation random salp swarm algorithm to track the plume. This strategy utilizes the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model to color the plume information and achieve a dynamic update of the plume information distribution. Therefore, this developed strategy provides potential source location clues for the robots, dynamically adjusting the robots' search behaviors and enhancing the source-seeking success rate and efficiency. This strategy is verified by experimental validations. The test results show that with two methods that use wind information, namely, the improved whale optimization algorithm and wind utilization II particle swarm optimization, and two approaches independent of wind information, namely, the fixed-step fruit fly optimization algorithm and improved particle swarm optimization, the proposed strategy improves the source localization success rate by 5% to 33% and accelerates the efficiency by 0.1 to 2.6 times in the obstacle-free scenario, and improves the source localization success rate by 4% to 100% and accelerates the efficiency by 0.4 to 2.2 times in the obstacle environment.

AB In the process of pig growth, key biological indicators, especially body condition scoring can accurately reflect the body condition of pigs, which has great essentiality. However, the existing manual scoring is time-consuming and labor-intensive and is readily influenced by the operator's subjective, resulting in large deviations. At present, the automatic measurement network for pig body condition scoring has not been popularized, so it is necessary to research and develop an automatic, efficient and accurate pig body condition scoring (BCS) algorithm. We extracted a total of 21,943 rear and upper images of 1674 pigs from videos in the piggery and then devised an automatic labeling method for the dataset. After being scored and processed by professionals, the dataset is fed into a YOLOX-based improved object detection and measurement network. In order to further improve the BCS estimation accuracy, we introduce an attention mechanism in the measurement network and design a dynamic loss weight optimizer. Compared with the basic YOLOX network, the improved network has got promising test results. We conduct experiments on 380 pictures completely independent of the training set. The model experiment result demonstrates that the accuracy rate of the pig body condition scoring algorithm proposed in this paper can achieve a AP of 80.06%. After deployed on the jetson NX, the accuracy of model drops by only 1.53%, and the inference speed is able to reach 29FPS. This means that it have access to be applied to actual pig breeding.

AB Internet of medical things (IoMT) is becoming more prevalent in healthcare applications as a result of current AI advancements, helping to improve our quality of life and ensure a sustainable health system. IoMT systems with cutting-edge scientific capabilities are capable of detecting, transmitting, learning and reasoning. As a result, these systems proved tremendously useful in a range of healthcare applications, including brain tumour detection. A deep learning-based approach for identifying MRI images of brain tumour patients and normal patients is suggested. The morphological-based segmentation method is applied in this approach to separate tumour areas in MRI images. Convolutional neural networks, such as LeNET, MobileNetV2, Densenet and ResNet, are tested to be the most efficient ones in terms of detection performance. The suggested approach is applied to a dataset gathered from several hospitals. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, recall and F-score. According to the performance evaluation, the accuracy of LeNET, MobileNetV2, Densenet, ResNet and EfficientNet is 98.7%, 93.6%, 92.8%, 91.6% and 91.9%, respectively. When compared to the existing approaches, LeNET has the best performance, with an average of 98.7% accuracy.

AB Training a deep-learning text classification model usually requires a large amount of labeled data, yet labeling data are usually labor-intensive and time-consuming. Few-shot text classification focuses on predicting unknown samples using only a few labeled samples. Recently, metric-based meta-learning methods have achieved promising results in few-shot text classification. They use episodic training in labeled samples to enhance the model's generalization ability. However, existing models only focus on learning from a few labeled samples but neglect to learn from a large number of unlabeled samples. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge learned by the model in unlabeled samples to improve the generalization performance of the meta-network. Specifically, we introduce a novel knowledge distillation method that expands and enriches the meta-learning representation with self-supervised information. Meanwhile, we design a graph aggregation method that efficiently interacts the query set information with the support set information in each task and outputs a more discriminative representation. We conducted experiments on three public few-shot text classification datasets. The experimental results show that our model performs better than the state-of-the-art models in 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot cases.

AB Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is an important research topic in unmanned platforms. The SLAM method, coupled with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), has recently received much attention due to its excellent performance. However, the tightly coupled LiDAR and IMU odometry (LIO) will be interfered with by the unknown initial state during system startup, which will lead to system startup failure in severe cases, especially in the case of low-cost sensors. Therefore, this paper presents a Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) aided initialization procedure to estimate unknown initial states assuming that the vehicle always starts from stationary. The proposed initialization procedure includes two phases: static phase and dynamic phase, and this paper also proposes a Zero Velocity Detector to distinguish the two phases precisely. The proposed system is evaluated on the datasets gathered from the campus zone with low-cost sensors to evaluate the whole system. The results show that our approach can effectively improve robustness and partly improve precision when the system is bootstrapped.

AB High-quality perception data is the basis of the operation of mobile crowdsensing platform. False data has a negative impact on the perception platform to draw wrong conclusions and cannot provide valuable help to service requesters. In order to solve this problem, we propose a trusted user selection framework based on generative adversarial network to select perceived users from the perspective of providing data, named PnGAN. The framework requires users to provide evaluation opinions on the current environment when uploading data, the evaluation opinion can not only reflect the current situation of the perceived environment, it can also be used as one of the data for user credibility evaluation. The analysis module in the framework processes the data uploaded by users, and apply the trust matrix to calculate the reputation value, determine user credibility based on reputation value. Experiments show that, compared with other algorithms for selecting trusted users, the average error rate of our method decreased by 30.62%, and the data quality improved by 15.32%.

AB Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) has played key roles in every aspect of daily routine tasks. IoT appli-cations suffer from higher latency and limited network bandwidth in the internet core. However, due to bandwidth and resource constraints, the resultant massive data traffic triggers storage overhead, high latency, and network bottleneck problems. Therefore, cloud computing and fog computing are introduced as popular IoT assistance. In fact, using a fog layer with such a highly dynamic environment raises a place-ment problem that needs to identify the optimal fog node that can be assigned to place the sensed data there. However, using a single copy of the datum in a single node can increase the concurrent access and maximize the network latency. Therefore, replication is considered a known technique to improve avail-ability by publishing many replicas to many sites. However, using replication causes a degree of temporal data inconsistency and requires the application to be tolerant.

AB This paper addresses the formation control problem for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots (NMRs) under noisy communication. The communication signals with noisy information are transmitted among different robots by a directed graph. Only the individual mobile robot can obtain its true and feasible states without communication. To achieve the desired formation of multiple robots, the sensor-to-control signals with the noisy channel are modeled by a nonlinear function, which includes unknown and estimated parameters. Based on the adaptive control technique and robust control technique, the unknown parameters of noisy signal models are estimated and compensated, respectively. Meanwhile, the prescribed performances are enforced to standardize the transient performance of nonholonomic mobile robots. Then, a novel distributed prescribed performance formation control scheme is designed to guarantee formation errors evolving always with the predefined regions under noisy communication, achieving the desired formation. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the formation errors are proved to converge to a compact set, and closed states are bounded. Simulations are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the true signals estimation algorithm and distributed prescribed performance formation control laws.

AB This paper presents a cross-domain and cross-view framework for underwater robot localisation, which does not require any Global Positioning System (GPS) information. The proposed localisation method uses colour aerial images and underwater acoustic images to estimate the robot's position. The method identifies the correlation among images from distinct domains, given by the matching of images acquired in partially structured environments with shared features. The validation of the proposed method is done using a real dataset, which was acquired by an underwater vehicle in a Marina. Besides, it was compared to Dead Reckoning and a learning-based particle filter method. The experimental results present the feasibility of the proposed method and its advances in relation to state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI Inverse Kinematics Solution Based on Redundancy Modeling and Desired

DE Dual mobile manipulators; Inverse kinematics; Redundant degrees of
   freedom; Redundancy parameters; Optimization solution

AB Dual mobile manipulators are increasingly used in cooperative operation tasks, and their appropriate joint configurations are the premise to ensure the success of the tasks. However, for a given task path, due to the existence of redundant degrees of freedom, there are countless possible joint configurations, which makes it difficult to solve the inverse kinematics. In addition, most of the existing redundant inverse kinematics solutions are only for redundant manipulators or single mobile manipulator, with less consideration given to the impact of the constraints between the dual mobile manipulators on the solution performance. To this end, a new inverse kinematics solution method for the dual mobile manipulators is proposed in the paper. First, six parameters are introduced to describe the kinematic redundancy, so as to transform the inverse kinematics of the dual mobile manipulators into non-redundant inverse kinematics. Then, in order to make full use of the redundancy, the weighted product form of the normalized ideal redundant behaviors including manipulability, joint motion continuity, collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance and joint motion synchronization is considered as an objective function. Finally, the redundancy parameters are optimized by the Nelder-Mead simplex method to obtain the desired joint configurations. Based on the platform composed of SUMMIT-XL STEEL mobile robot and UR5 manipulator, a single target pose solution is simulated. Moreover, using the platform composed of SUMMIT-XL STEEL mobile robot and AUBO-i16 manipulator, the performance of path solution and obstacle avoidance is evaluated experimentally. The simulation and experimental results show that under the constraints of the desired redundant behaviors, satisfactory joint configurations can be acquired in the reachable space of the joints. Besides, the joint configurations of the dual mobile manipulators are solved in about 1 ms. It follows that the proposed method can select the optimized one from multiple possible joint configurations by the redundancy parameters optimization.

AB Exploration and mapping of unknown environments is a fundamental task in applications for autonomous robots. In this article, we present a complete framework for deploying Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in autonomous exploration missions in unknown subterranean areas. The main motive of exploration algorithms is to depict the next best frontier for the MAV such that new ground can be covered in a fast, safe yet efficient manner. The proposed framework uses a novel frontier selection method that also contributes to the safe navigation of autonomous MAVs in obstructed areas such as subterranean caves, mines, and urban areas. The framework presented in this work bifurcates the exploration problem in local and global exploration. The proposed exploration framework is also adaptable according to computational resources available onboard the MAV which means the trade-off between the speed of exploration and the quality of the map can be made. Such capability allows the proposed framework to be deployed in subterranean exploration and mapping as well as in fast search and rescue scenarios. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated in detailed simulation studies with comparisons made against a high-level exploration-planning framework developed for the DARPA Sub-T challenge as it will be presented in this article.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel dual-handed master single slave teleoperation framework based on the four-channel structure and wave variable theory. Through the coordination of dual-handed masters, the teleoperation system may exert more accurate and flexible operations, such as grasping soft objects. In practice, it is inevitable to generate partial active power by human operators, which may decrease the stability of the system. Considering the partial active power in dual-handed masters, we discuss and give the definite maximum proportion to stabilize the system. With the proposed framework and the partial active power of dual-handed masters, we design an energy flow-based teleoperation control that combines the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller with a disturbance observer to maintain stability, increase the tracking accuracy and enhance the transparency of the system. The stability of the system is analyzed, and numerical simulations are performed to verify the performance of the proposed control. For real robot experiments, we designed a platform including two Omni robots and an industrial manipulator, which acted as dual-handed masters and a single slave manipulator. A computer is used to connect the communication between the masters and the slave side. Real soft object grasping teleoperations are presented; the results show the high efficiency of the proposed method.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB To improve the robustness of overhead crane controllers to variations in system physical parameters and enable a smooth startup of crane systems, an adaptive time-varying sliding mode controller optimized via an improved honey badger algorithm (IHBA-ATSMC) is proposed herein. Unlike the conventional crane control method, the ATSMC can ensure that the control force increases smoothly from zero to realize the smooth start of the crane system, and does not need to predict the precise information of the system (including physical parameters and friction parameters). To better release the control performance of ATSMC, an improved honey Badger algorithm was designed to obtain the controller parameters with good performance, and the parameters optimization goal of ATSMC can be achieved in limited time. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the IHBA-ATSMC offers outstanding anti-swing positioning, a smooth startup, robustness enhancement, and parameter tuning.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB In single image super-resolution (SISR), although PSNR is a key metric for signal fidelity, images with high PSNR do not necessarily render high visual quality. As a result, current perception-driven SISR meth-ods employ perceptual metrics close to the human eye to measure the quality of the generated images. Unfortunately, the perceptual loss and adversarial loss, widely used by the perception-driven SISR meth-ods, still underperform on these non-differentiable perceptual metrics. To this end, we propose a generic multi-scale perceptual loss, i.e., the patch loss, which can be easily plugged into off-the-shelf SISR meth-ods to improve a broad range of perceptual metrics. Specifically, the proposed patch loss minimizes the multi-scale similarity of image patches and enhances the restoration of regions with complex textures and sharp edges via parameter-free adaptive patch-wise attention. Our proposed patch loss introduces more realistic details compared to the perceptual loss and fewer artifacts compared to the adversarial loss. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) technology has been widely used in recommendation systems because most information in recommendation systems has a graph structure in nature, and GNNs have advan-tages in graph representation learning. In sequential recommendation, the relationships between inter-acting items can be constructed as an isomorphic graph, and (GNNs) can capture high-order information between graph nodes. Many models have used graph-based methods for sequential recommendation, and achieved great success. However, the existing research only considers the number of interactions between items when constructing the item graph. As such, revisions are needed to capture the multi-dimensional transformation relationships between items. Hence, we emphasize the importance of multi-dimensional information, and we propose a Category and Time information integrated Graph Neural Network (CT-GNN), which combines the item category and interaction time information with a multi-layer graph con-volution network to form multi-dimensional fine-grained item representations. In addition, we design a temporal self-attention network to model the dynamic user preference and make the next-item rec-ommendation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed model.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK; DOMAINS; SYSTEM
AB Fast Flux Botnet (FFB) is an advance method developed by cyber criminals to perpetrate distributed malicious attacks. The major problems of existing FFB detection systems are the vulnerability to evasion mechanisms, long detection time, and high dimensionality of the feature set. In this study, an improved FFB detection architecture called Bot-FFX was developed to address some of these problems. The developed Bot-FFX consists of four modules: extractor, filter, resolver, and detector. The extractor module is responsible for Domain Name System (DNS) queries on domains. The filter module can classify the incoming domains as either blacklist or whitelist and sends the unclassified domains to the resolver. The resolver extracts all IP addresses associated with the domain at its Time-To-Live (TTL) within a time frame of 10 min. The detector module uses a rule-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) for botnet detection. The detector computed the Standard Deviation of Round Trip Time (SDRTT), Average Google Hits (AGH) and Genetic Threshold Value (GTV) for all IP addresses associated with the domains. The detector, built on a decision tree rules and the K-Dimensional (KD) tree KNN algorithm, classified the domains using the set of IP addresses, SDRTT, AGH, and GTV. The Bot-FFX was implemented on a dataset of 2,000 benign domains and 1,630 botnet domains. The dataset was split into 50% training and 50% testing sets. The evaluation results on the same datasets showed that Bot-FFX is an effective FFB detection system with accuracy, false positive, and false negative of 99.178%, 0.8%, and 0.8% respectively.

AB Accurate wind speed prediction improves the efficiency of electricity and also increases the economic benefits of wind farms. However, the previous studies do not fully consider the chronological feature of wind speed, and do not properly identify and use the characteristic decomposed components of wind speed series in different time periods. The phenomenon of insufficient and excessive decomposition of components weakens the prediction accuracy of the model and destroys the power generation plan of the wind farm. In this paper, a segmented multi-modal deep learning integrated model based on periodicity is proposed. Firstly, the time series is reconstructed into matrix according to date; the matrix is divided into different segment matrices according to chronological characteristics; each sub-matrix is spliced into sub-sequence according to chronological order. Secondly, the contribution extremum method is used to determine the optimal feature components of all sub-sequences. Thirdly, the optimized deep learning model integrates all sub-sequences and then obtains the prediction results of the current date. Finally, the uncertainty analysis of the predicted value further improves the reliability of wind speed prediction. The data of wind farm in Hexi corridor area of China are used to simulate the experiment, and the results show that the proposed model has good performance. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The rise in technological advancements and Social Networking Sites (SNS) made people more engaged in their virtual lives. Research has revealed that people feel more comfortable posting their feelings, including suicidal thoughts, on SNS than discussing them through face-to-face settings due to the social stigma associated with mental health. This research study aims to develop a multi-class machine learning classifier for identifying suicidal risk levels in social media posts. The proposed Enhanced Feature Engineering Approach for Suicidal Risk Identification (EFASRI) is used to extract features from a novel dataset collected from Twitter and Reddit platforms. Three machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were employed for classification. The study demonstrates significant improvements in the precision, recall, and overall accuracy compared to previous research that used classical feature extraction mechanisms. The best-performing algorithm, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), achieved an overall accuracy of 96.33%. The findings imply that different features contain different levels of information, and the right combination of the features supplied to the machine learning algorithms may improve the prediction results.

The research results show that the accuracy of FE-BDP algorithm can maintain above 95% for a long time, and the change is not significant with the increase of the number of users, indicating that the algorithm has strong stability. The loss value of FE-LDP model is significantly smaller than that of other models and can be stabilized below 0.05. The data aggregation time of blockchain encryption technology is less than 1.0s. The edge-asynchronous communication framework can be applied to multiple urban scenarios and achieve effective data communication, with the highest accuracy rate of 93.87%and the lowest communication cost of 1315.29s. The research results show that the security encryption fusion technology can effectively protect user data privacy, and the edge-asynchronous communication framework has obvious effect on improving communication efficiency, which has important application value for promoting the construction of smart city informatization.

AB This paper focuses on the problem of personalized federated learning (FL) with the schema of contrastive learning (CL), which is to implement collaborative pattern classification by many clients. The traditional FL frameworks mostly facilitate the global model for the server and the local models for the clients to be similar, often ignoring the data heterogeneity of the clients. Aiming at achieving better performance in clients, this study introduces a personalized federated contrastive learning model, dubbed PerFCL, by proposing a new approach to doubly contrastive representation learning (DCL). Concretely, PerFCL bor-rows the DCL scheme, where one CL loss compares the shared parts of local models with the global model and the other CL loss compares the personalized parts of local models with the global model. To encourage the difference between the two parts, we created a double optimization problem composed of maximizing the comparison agreement for the former and minimizing the comparison agreement for the latter. We evaluated the proposed model on three publicly available data sets for federated image clas-sification. Experiment results show that PerFCL benefits from the proposed DCL strategy and performs better than the state-of-the-art federated-learning models.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The position of the target in video trackers based on the Siamese network is usually obtained by calculating the similarity score of features between the target template and the predicted region. This method performs poorly in complex scenarios due to such problems as the deformation of the target and motion blur. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a transformer-like feature fusion mechanism to fuse the temporal information of consecutive frames of the video. We separate the encoder and decoder into two parallel branches to accommodate the characteristics of Siamese networks. The features of the target template are enhanced by a transformer-like encoder while temporal feature-related information is fused by using a transformer-like decoder. The results of experiments on the standard OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and NFS datasets showed that the proposed network outperforms most mainstream algorithms in the area.

The results show that: (1) The physiological, psychological, pathological, pharmacological, physical and psychosocial factors exert tremendous influence on communication networks. The psychosocial factors are more prominent. (2) There is security threshold in communication networks. It means that the security state can be entered if security threshold is crossed. This paper designs security threshold as the III level (5.5 <= P < 6.5). (3) This paper proposes 3E rules (That is, engineering, education, enforcement). It is beneficial to deal with security risks in communication networks. (4) After two security evaluations, the result is G2 = 6.70 > G 1 = 5.01. This confirms the effectiveness of the security management model.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

AB Advertising corporations have moved their focus to online and in-App advertisements in response to the expansion of digital technologies and social media. Online advertising represents the primary revenue source for advertising networks that serve as the middlemen between advertisers and advertisement publishers. The advertising networks pay the publisher of the advertisement based on the number of clicks through to advertisers, following the pay-per-click (PPC) payment scheme. However, there is a growing security issue with this payment approach known as Click Fraud. Click fraud is the illegal process of clicking on pay-per-click advertisements to increase publishers' revenue or deplete advertisers' bud-gets. Artificial intelligence techniques have been increasingly employed to solve complicated challenges in different research areas, including cybersecurity, to achieve unexpected outcomes. In this paper, sev-eral Machine Learning models were constructed to establish whether the user is a human or a bot and conducted a comparative performance analysis using a set of evaluation metrics. We used a real captured dataset detailing Internet users' behavior while navigating websites. We extracted a set of features related to users' behaviors, including the number of webpages viewed during the browsing session, the duration of the browsing journey, and the actions performed. The empirical results revealed that all the considered models obtained good results, where the random forest algorithm surpassed all other algorithms in all evaluation metrics.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Context: Timing side-channel attack countermeasure techniques (TSCA-CTs) evaluation is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem based on different MPSoCs of IoT platform architectures, performance, and design overhead. Therefore, the Fermatean by fuzzy decision opinion score method (F-FDOSM) for prioritizing the powerful countermeasure technique against timing side-channel attack is the best approach because it employs the most efficient MCDM ranking technique. Nonetheless, the FDOSM method needs to weigh the criteria before being submitted for the ranking process. In order to address this theoretical challenge, the Criteria-importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) technique can be applied as an effective MCDM weighting technique to offer an explicit weight for a set of criteria with no inconsistency based on the standard deviation, which uses correlation analysis to determine the relevance of each criterion.Objectives: This research proposes a Fermatean-FDOSM framework for evaluating TSCA-CTs in the con-text of MPSoCs-based IoT and CRITIC techniques to weight the criteria.Methods: The methodology is presented in three phases. Firstly, a proposed countermeasure techniques dataset was collected that included seven defense approaches (e.g., Gossip and SER router) based on ten criteria (e.g., number of malicious IP cores, number of routers, power, latency... etc.). Then, the decision matrix was built based on an intersection of the countermeasure techniques as an alternative and MPSoC design and performance criteria. Then, the multi-criteria decision-making methods were integrated. The CRITIC method for criteria weighting was followed by the development of the Fermatean-FDOSM method for ranking.Results: (1) CRITIC weighting shows that MPSoC NoC throughput (packet/clock) is the highest weight cri-terion, whereas latency (clock/cycle) is the less weight criterion. (2) The Fermatean-FDOSM-based group ranking shows that the Adaptive routing countermeasure technique is the highest score alternative com-pared to the Combined with separate interface hybrid approach. (3) The TSCA-CTs priority ranks were subjected to a systematic ranking that was confirmed by strong correlation results throughout ten crite-rion weight values. A comparison with recent studies confirmed the feasibility of the proposed frame-work.Conclusion: The outcomes of this study are anticipated to give particular knowledge and direction to those who want to do decision theory-based MPSoCs-based IoT and NoC communication security research.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Due to advances in technology, social media has become the most popular medium for spreading news. Many messages are published on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Social media platforms also provide opportunities to express opinions and social phenomena such as hate, offensive language, racism, sexual content, and all forms of verbal violence, which have amazingly increased. These behaviors do not only affect specific countries, groups, or societies but extend beyond these areas into people's daily lives. This study examines sexual content and harassment discourse in Arabic social media to build an accurate system for detecting sexual harassment expressions. The dataset was collected from Twitter posts to make the classification. A deep learning model was developed as a classification system to identify sexual speech using Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with word embedding and the FastText previously trained on the Arabic language model. The proposed (TCN-BiLSTM) model was compared with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The CASH dataset implemented with the (TCN-Bi-LSTM) model gate obtained an accuracy rate of 96.65% and an F0.5 value of 0.969. The implementation of XGBoost using word embed-dings resulted in an accuracy rate of 92.56% and an F0.5 value of 0.925. Findings and manual interpreta-tion showed that different text representation methods with various deep learning algorithms obtain higher classification performance easily in complex sentences. This strategy is helpful with languages that are difficult to study morphologically, like Arabic, Turkish, and Lithuanian.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Depth estimation from thermal images is one potential solution to achieve reliability and robustness against diverse weather, lighting, and environmental conditions. Also, a self-supervised training method further boosts its scalability to various scenar-ios, which are usually impossible to collect ground-truth labels, such as GPS-denied and LiDAR-denied conditions. However, self-supervision from thermal images is usually insufficient to train networks due to the thermal image properties, such as low-contrast and textureless properties. Introducing additional self-supervision sources (e.g., RGB images) also introduces further hardware and software constraints, such as complicated multi-sensor calibration and synchronized data acquisition. Therefore, this manuscript proposes a novel training framework combining self-supervised learning and adversarial feature adaptation to leverage additional modality information without such constraints. The framework aims to train a network that estimates a monocular depth map from a thermal image in a self-supervised manner. In the training stage, the framework uti-lizes two self-supervisions; image reconstruction of unpaired RGB-thermal images and adversarial feature adaptation between unpaired RGB-thermal features. Based on the proposed method, the trained network achieves state-of-the-art quantitative results and edge-preserved depth estimation results compared to previous methods.

AB In robot teaching, the grasping strategies taught to robots by users are critical information, because these strategies contain the implicit knowledge necessary to successfully perform a series of manipulations; however, limited practical knowledge exists on how to utilize linguistic information for supporting grasp-type recognition in multimodal teaching. This study focused on the effects of text-driven object affordance-a prior distribution of grasp types for each object-on image-based grasp-type recognition. To this end, we created the datasets of first-person grasping-hand images labeled with grasp types and object names and tested if the object affordance enhanced the performance of image-based recognition. We evaluated two scenarios with real and illusory objects to be grasped, considering a teaching condition in mixed reality, where the lack of visual object information can make image-based recognition challenging. The results show that object affordance guided the image-based recognition in two scenarios, that is, increasing the recognition accuracy by (1) excluding the unlikely grasp types from the candidates and (2) enhancing the likely grasp types. Additionally, the "enhancing effect" was more pronounced with greater grasp-type bias for each object in a test dataset. These results indicate the effectiveness of object affordance for guiding grasp-type recognition in multimodal robot teaching applications. The contributions of this study are (1) demonstrating the effectiveness of object affordance in guiding grasp-type recognition both with and without the real objects in images, (2) demonstrating the conditions under which the merits of object affordance are pronounced, and (3) providing a dataset of first-person grasping images labeled with possible grasp types for each object.

AB As a special detection task, sonar image object detection has been suffering from two main problems: the widespread noise and the lack of high-frequency information. In this paper, we propose two independent modules to solve the above two problems. For the widespread noise, we propose the foreground semantic enhancement module. Different from simple feature fusion, this module creatively associates the semantic map with features from each feature level, thus increasing the foreground-background distance and highlighting the object information. To solve the problem of insufficient high-frequency information, we propose the foreground edge enhancement module. This module inventively combines RNN networks to enhance edges by spatial semantic information from different directions as a way to improve the feature representation of foreground objects. Based on the above two modules, we design a novel detection architecture, foreground enhancement network (FEN), which enhances the features of a single point to make the classification more powerful and the localization more accurate. Through extensive experimental validation, our FEN network achieves high-performance improvement when combined with different detectors, and achieves the highest 10% mAP performance improvement when combined with a single-stage detector (FCOS).

AB It is challenging to handle the non-linear power consumption model, complex workflow structures, and diverse user-defined deadlines for energy-efficient workflow scheduling in sustainable cloud computing. Although metaheuristics are very attractive to solve this problem, most of the existing work regards the problem as a black-box and ignores the use of domain knowledge. To make up for their shortcomings, this paper tailors an energy-aware intelligent scheduling algorithm (EIS) with three new mechanisms. First, we derive the optimal execution time that minimizes energy consumption for each task on a given resource. Second, based on the optimal execution time of each workflow task, the EIS distributes the workflow slack time (difference between its completion time and deadline) to reduce the voltages and frequencies of task executions for energy saving. Third, the EIS mines the idle time gaps caused by task precedence constraints to further reduce dynamic energy consumption whilst satisfying workflows' deadline constraints. To measure the performance of the EIS, we conduct extensive comparison experi-ments based on actual workflow applications. The results demonstrate that the energy consumption of the EIS is much lower than that of the competitors under different deadlines, and has a faster descend rate with the evolution process.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Despite the success of deep learning in medical image segmentation, most deep learning-based segmentation methods utilize pixel-wise losses as their training objectives, which focus on the local information around each pixel but lack global context. In this paper, we propose a set of shape description losses to supervise the training of the segmentation networks by extracting and quantifying geometric features of the targets, including volume, surface area, center of mass, and bounding box. We believe that these loss functions can introduce global geometrical and statistical constraints into the training procedure. The proposed shape losses are differentiable and can be computed efficiently. We demonstrate that using the proposed shape losses alone for weakly supervised learning can obtain promising performance. The results of our study illustrate the effectiveness of the shape descriptions with physical meanings on segmenting different organs from various modalities, including liver from computed tomography, left atrium from magnetic resonance imaging, and prostate from ultrasound volume.

AB Recent advances in the intelligence video monitoring system have received widespread attention for the detection of anomalous human behavior in crowded scenes. Due to the varying crowd densities, low-resolution videos, inter-object occlusions, and complex human crowds, the detection of abnormalities from human activities is extremely challenging. Hence, automatic analysis of behavioral patterns is necessary for accurately modeling crowd behavior and alerting human operators about suspicious activities on the scene. In response to these concerns, we propose a two-stream multi-scale patch-based pyramidal dilated 3D fully connected network (FCN) with attentive bidirectional long short-term memory (2MPD-3DFCN-AttBiDLSTM) for detecting and locating abnormal activities in the frame. This model effectively captures the spatial-temporal features with a dilated convolution network, and thus the motion and optical flow information features are exploited from the continuous frame, which improves the detection accuracy. Also, we introduce a parallel weighted skip connection into the residual learning framework that preserves the rich characteristics of the input data to be learned without the loss of effective features. Based on the attentive mechanism in the bidirectional LSTM model, two directions of temporal and global representations are extracted that enhance the classification of unusual and normal activity in the visual sequences. Experimental analysis is performed with the two publicly available datasets and evaluated in terms of the equal error rate, precision-recall curve, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve metrics measures. The result shows that the proposed model outperforms the existing model and achieves high detection results in the video surveillance monitoring system.

AB The purpose of 5G-MIMO communication systems is to boost the intensity of the received signal, and facilitate the application of the users' apparatus. However, in band-grabbing systems such as these, the accessibility of a spectrum is hindered by gridlocks. Also, to be considered is the spectrum's waveform, which is the type that contends with 5G networks specifically. This undertaking involves the development of a 5G-MIMO communication system based SS, in which the spectrum is enhanced, by way of a spectrum sensing (SS) algorithm. By replicating the energy detection procedure, this recommended SS algorithm engages the cosine law to filter the traffic signal, and subsequently portions it using the Welch algorithm. The Hann algorithm is then utilized, to window the traffic signal, to damp the high power delivered to the MIMO. The key role, of the SS algorithm, is to sense a spectrum for 5G-MIMO communication system, with the capacity to damp the MIMO effect for a variety of waveforms. The SS algorithm expressions are applicable for both non-cooperative and centralized cooperative users. For each expression, an examination was performed for waveforms used by 5G-MIMO communication systems. This included filtered-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (F-OFDM), universal filtered multicarrier (UFMC), and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) waveforms. The operating parameters, including SNR, the signal span and power, the antenna count, as well as the types of modulation for both noncooperative and centralized cooperative users, were scrutinized. The simulation results revealed a notable achievement for the parameters lower than zero dB of SNR, greater than 95% global detection probability, less than 1% global system error probability, and less than 1% global false alarm probability. An evaluation of the recommended system's parameters discloses its superiority, in comparison to other previously developed systems. (c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE BEV perception; Semantic segmentation; View alignment
AB Bird's-eye-view (BEV) grid is a typical representation of the perception of road components, e.g., drivable area, in autonomous driving. Most existing approaches rely on cameras only to perform segmentation in BEV space, which is fundamentally constrained by the absence of reliable depth information. The latest works leverage both camera and LiDAR modalities but suboptimally fuse their features using simple, concatenation-based mechanisms. In this paper, we address these problems by enhancing the alignment of the unimodal features in order to aid feature fusion, as well as enhancing the alignment between the cameras' perspective view (PV) and BEV representations. We propose X-Align, a novel end-to-end cross-modal and cross-view learning framework for BEV segmentation consisting of the following components: (i) a novel Cross-Modal Feature Alignment (X-FA) loss, (ii) an attention-based Cross-Modal Feature Fusion (X-FF) module to align multi-modal BEV features implicitly, and (iii) an auxiliary PV segmentation branch with Cross-View Segmentation Alignment (X-SA) losses to improve the PV-to-BEV transformation. We evaluate our proposed method across two commonly used benchmark datasets, i.e., nuScenes and KITTI-360. Notably, X-Align significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3 absolute mIoU points on nuScenes. We also provide extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the individual components.

DT Article
DE Capsule network; Convolutional neural network; Image classification
AB The capsule network is a distinct and promising segment of the neural network family that has drawn attention due to its unique ability to maintain equivariance by preserving spatial relationships among the features. The capsule network has attained unprecedented success in image classification with datasets such as MNIST and affNIST by encoding the characteristic features into capsules and building a parse-tree structure. However, on datasets involving complex foreground and background regions, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, the performance of the capsule network is suboptimal due to its naive data routing policy and incompetence in extracting complex features. This paper proposes a new design strategy for capsule network architectures for efficiently dealing with complex images. The proposed method incorporates the optimal placement of the novel wide bottleneck residual block and squeeze and excitation Attention Blocks into the capsule network upheld by the modified factorized machines routing algorithm to address the defined problem. This setup allows channel interdependencies at almost no computational cost, thereby enhancing the representation ability of capsules on complex images. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed model on the five publicly available datasets, namely the CIFAR-10, Fashion MNIST, Brain Tumor, SVHN, and the CIFAR-100 datasets. The proposed method outperformed the top-5 capsule network-based methods on Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN, Brain Tumor, and gave a highly competitive performance on the CIFAR-100 datasets.

DE Few-shot learning; Meta-learning; HyperNetworks; Kernel methods;
   Bayesian neural networks
AB Few-shot models aim at making predictions using a minimal number of labeled examples from a given task. The main challenge in this area is the one-shot setting, where only one element represents each class. We propose the general framework for few-shot learning via kernel HyperNetworks-the fusion of kernels and hypernetwork paradigm. Firstly, we introduce the classical realization of this framework, dubbed HyperShot. Compared to reference approaches that apply a gradient-based adjustment of the parameters, our models aim to switch the classification module parameters depending on the task's embedding. In practice, we utilize a hypernetwork, which takes the aggregated information from support data and returns the classifier's parameters handcrafted for the considered problem. Moreover, we introduce the kernel-based representation of the support examples delivered to hypernetwork to create the parameters of the classification module. Consequently, we rely on relations between the support examples' embeddings instead of the backbone models' direct feature values. Thanks to this approach, our model can adapt to highly different tasks. While such a method obtains very good results, it is limited by typical problems such as poorly quantified uncertainty due to limited data size. We further show that incorporating Bayesian neural networks into our general framework, an approach we call BayesHyperShot, solves this issue.

AB Aortic stenosis (AS) is an acute and chronic cardiovascular disease and If left untreated, 50% of these patients will die within two years of developing symptoms. AS is characterized as the stiffening of the aortic valve leaflets which restricts their motion and prevents the proper opening under transvalvular pressure. Assessments of the valve dynamics, if available, would provide valuable information about the patient's state of cardiac deterio-ration as well as heart recovery and can have incredible impacts on patient care, planning interventions and making critical clinical decisions with life-threatening risks. Despite remarkable advancements in medical im-aging, there are no clinical tools available to quantify valve dynamics invasively or noninvasively. In this study, we developed a highly innovative ultrasound-based non-invasive computational framework that can function as a diagnostic tool to assess valve dynamics (e.g. transient 3-D distribution of stress and displacement, 3-D deformed shape of leaflets, geometric orifice area and angular positions of leaflets) for patients with AS at no risk to the patients. Such a diagnostic tool considers the local valve dynamics and the global circulatory system to provide a platform for testing the intervention scenarios and evaluating their effects. We used clinical data of 12 patients with AS not only to validate the proposed framework but also to demonstrate its diagnostic abilities by providing novel analyses and interpretations of clinical data in both pre and post intervention states. We used transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) data for the developments and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) data for validation.

AB Symbolic planning can provide an intuitive interface for non-expert users to operate autonomous robots by abstracting away much of the low-level programming. However, symbolic planners assume that the initially provided abstract domain and problem descriptions are closed and complete. This means that they are fundamentally unable to adapt to changes in the environment or tasks that are not captured by the initial description. We propose a method that allows an agent to automatically extend the abstract description of its skill set upon encountering such a situation. We introduce strategies for generalizing from previous experience, completing sequences of key actions and discovering preconditions to ensure computational efficiency. The resulting system is evaluated on a symbolic planning benchmark task and on object rearrangement tasks in simulation. Compared to a Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline, our strategies for efficient search have on average a 25% higher success rate at a 67% faster runtime.

AB This paper concerns the systematic testing of robotic control software based on state-based models. We focus on cyclic systems that typically receive inputs (values from sensors), perform computations, produce outputs (sent to actuators) and possibly change state. We provide a testing theory for such cyclic systems where time can be represented and probabilities are used to quantify non-deterministic choices, making it possible to model probabilistic algorithms. In addition, refusals, the inability of a system to perform a set of actions, are taken into account. We consider several possible testing scenarios. For example, a tester might only be able to passively observe a sequence of events and so cannot check probabilities, while in another scenario a tester might be able to repeatedly apply a test case and so estimate the probabilities of sequences of events. These different testing scenarios lead to a range of implementation relations (notions of correctness). As a consequence, this paper provides formal definitions of implementation relations that can form the basis of sound automated testing in a range of testing scenarios. We also validate the implementation relations by showing how observers can be used to provide an alternative but equivalent characterisation.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Visual attention is one of the most significant characteristics for selecting and understanding the outside redundancy world. The human vision system cannot process all information simultaneously due to the visual information bottleneck. In order to reduce the redundant input of visual information, the human visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of scenes. This is commonly known as visual saliency map prediction. This paper proposed a new psychophysical oriented saliency prediction architecture, which inspired by multi-channel model of visual cortex functioning in humans. The model consists of opponent color channels, wavelet transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast sensitivity function for extracting low-level image features and providing a maximum approximation to the low-level human visual system. The proposed model is evaluated using several datasets, including the MIT1003, MIT300, TORONTO, SID4VAM, and UCF Sports datasets. We also quantitatively and qualitatively compare the saliency prediction performance with that of other state-of-the-art models. Our model achieved strongly stable and better performance with different metrics on natural images, psychophysical synthetic images and dynamic videos. Additionally, we suggested that Fourier and spectral-inspired saliency prediction models outperformed other state-of-the-art non-neural network and even deep neural network models on psychophysical synthetic images. In the meantime, we suggest that deep neural networks need specific architectures and goals to be able to predict salient performance on psychophysical synthetic images better and more reliably. Finally, the proposed model could be used as a computational model of primate low-level vision system and help us understand mechanism of primate low-level vision system.

DT Article
DE Multi-object tracking; Joint detection and tracking; Adjacent-frame
   location prediction; Visibility-guided tracking
AB Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important task of computer vision which has a wide range of applications. Existing multi-object tracking methods mostly employ the Kalman filter to predict the object location in the next frame. However, if the video is captured by a camera with significant motion variation or contains objects moving at non-constant speed, the Kalman filter may fail. In addition, although object occlusion has been studied extensively in MOT, it has not been well addressed yet. To deal with these problems, a joint detection and tracking method named visibility-guided tracking for MOT (VGT-MOT) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, to cope with the difficulty of accurate object position estimation caused by drastic camera or object motion variation, VGT-MOT utilizes an adjacent-frame object location prediction network with inter-frame attention to predict the target position in the next frame. To handle object occlusion, VGT-MOT employs the object visibility as a dynamic weight to adaptively fuse the motion and appearance similarities and update the object appearance representation. The proposed VGT-MOT has been evaluated on the MOT16, MOT17 and MOT20 datasets. The results show that VGT-MOT compares favorably against state-of-the-art MOT approaches. The source code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/wang-ironman/VGT-MOT.

AB This paper first presents CycleDance, a novel dance style transfer system that transforms an existing motion clip in one dance style into a motion clip in another dance style while attempting to preserve the motion context of the dance. CycleDance extends existing CycleGAN architectures with multimodal transformer encoders to account for the music context. We adopt a sequence length-based curriculum learning strategy to stabilize training. Our approach captures rich and long-term intra-relations between motion frames, which is a common challenge in motion transfer and synthesis work. Building upon CycleDance, we further propose StarDance, which enables many-to-many mappings across different styles using a single generator network. Additionally, we introduce new metrics for gauging transfer strength and content preservation in the context of dance movements. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we perform an extensive ablation study and a human study with 30 participants, each with 5 or more years of dance experience. Our experimental results show that our approach can generate realistic movements with the target style, outperforming the baseline CycleGAN and its variants on naturalness, transfer strength, and content preservation. Our proposed approach has potential applications in choreography, gaming, animation, and tool development for artistic and scientific innovations in the field of dance.

SO MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Feature refinement; Cross-pooling; Global context; Object detection
AB Robust multi-scale object detection is challenging as it requires both spatial details and semantic knowledge to deal with problems including high scale variation and cluttered background. Appropriate fusion of high-resolution features with deep semantic features is the key issue to achieve better performance. Different approaches have been developed to extract and combine deep features with shallow layer spatial features, such as feature pyramid network. However, high-resolution feature maps contain noisy and distractive features. Directly combines shallow features with semantic features might degrade detection accuracy. Besides, contextual information is also important for multi-scale object detection. In this work, we present a feature refinement scheme to tackle the feature fusion problem. The proposed feature refinement module increases feature resolution and refine feature maps progressively with the guidance from deep features. Meanwhile, we propose a context extraction method to capture global and local contextual information. The method utilizes a multi-level cross-pooling unit to extract global context and a cascaded context module to extract local context. The proposed object detection framework has been evaluated on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches.

DE Instance-level human parsing; Multi-task learning; Pose estimation;
   Semantic features; Hierarchical association
AB Instance-level human parsing remains challenging due to the similarity between human instances and background, complex interactions, and various poses. Aiming at assigning each human-related pixel a semantic label and associate each label with the corresponding instance simultaneously, a new top-down method based on multi-task learning guided by crowded pose estimation is proposed to learn instance-level human semantic part information. Firstly, we introduce a path attention feature pyramid to learn more robust multi-scale shared semantic features by changing the feature propagation to concatenation and increasing channel attention at each layer in order to solve the problem of complex background. Secondly, by improving the learned shared features via spatial attention and RC-ASPP, we design an instance-agnostic human parsing module to learn body part segmentation and edge information. In addition, we design a Mask-RCNN-based crowded pose estimation module that uses D-SPPE and hierarchical association rules to obtain pose information. Finally, we define fusion strategy and multi-task learning loss to fuse different semantic features and instance features, which can learn the final instance-level human parsing results in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on PASCAL-Person-Part and MHPv2.0 dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed method that outperforms most of state-of-the-art methods.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are revolutionizing the globe with their sensing technologies. This ini-tiative aims to design and deploy a cattle health monitoring system (CHMS) for the agriculture sector for the well-being of livestock and the eradication of hunger. The production and consumption of all dairy and meat products can only be conducted responsibly if the health of the source animal is protected. In this regard, WSNs, a component of the Internet-of-things (IoT) system, can be utilized for monitoring cow health due to their adaptability and portability, which enables them to be applied to expansive domains such as cattle healthcare. The integration of IoT and artificial intelligence enables the prediction of livestock illnesses. The primary purpose of this proposed system is to forecast cattle diseases utilizing real-time data from non-invasive body-area sensors and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and to display the expected results to authorized personnel via a web application. Popular authentication schemes are used in this system as it is susceptible to hacking and requires robust network security to protect the con-fidentiality, integrity, and availability of its resources. The presented results validates the accuracy of the proposed novel system for cow diseases prediction that is approximately 98 percent. The proposed CHMS can assist concerned farmers in remotely monitoring the health of their livestock from a variety of loca-tions and in taking appropriate and timely measures to protect animal health. Technological automation will lower prices and labor inputs while enhancing farm output.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

   composite prediction; Foreground motion metric learning
AB Dynamic modeling of normal videos is the key problem for unsupervised video anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial composite prediction framework for unsupervised video anomaly detection, namely ACP-VAD. It consists of an adversarial composite prediction (ACP) module and a foreground motion metric learning (FMML) module. Given a video sequence, ACP module aims to learn reasonable normal video dynamics by using a generator for the sequential and composite predicting of video frames, and two discriminators for the frame-level and sequence-level adversarial learning. Moreover, to learn a more compact representation of normal video dynamics and improve the detection sensibility of motion anomalies, FMML module utilizes the sophisticated metric learning scheme over the latent space distributions of large foreground motion amplitude sequence, real normal sequence as well as real normal sequence containing previously sequential or composite prediction frames. Through these two modules, our framework can learn reasonable and compact spatial-temporal dynamics for normal videos, and the final anomaly detection task can be solved by computing the error between the predicted frame and its corresponding real frame. Comprehensive experimental results on UCSD Ped2, Avenue, and ShanghaiTech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of both ACP module and FMML module, and our final ACP-VAD framework achieves impressive performance, surpassing most of the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Female Anopheles mosquitoes are the primary vectors responsible for malaria transmission. The control of malaria is essential for humankind. In this study, we introduce a nonlinear deterministic model to control malaria disease by deploying Wolbachia bacteria into the Anopheles mosquitoes. Further, we study the effect of Wol-bachia on temperature variation in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. We analyze the model for its positivity and boundedness with an initial condition in a specific set so that the model is well-defined mathe-matically and meaningful epidemiologically. We find the malaria-free equilibrium points of the model and analyze the local stability of all the equilibrium points. We calculate the basic reproduction number by the next -generation matrix method, which shows the stability of malaria-free equilibrium. Then we explore malaria present endemic equilibrium in both cases: Wolbachia-infected and Wolbachia-free possibilities. We observe that the number of infections is less in the Wolbachia-infected equilibrium case, and we find that Wolbachia can reduce malaria transmission in all temperature conditions. The sensitivity analysis of all different parameters is also calculated. We demonstrate the optimum temperature (from 22 degrees C to 28 degrees C) by numerical simulation where the malaria exposure and transmission rate is high. We can apply the work in all subtropical and tropical regions to control malaria transmission worldwide.

AB Members of the armed forces rely on having an effective and efficient medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) process for evacuating casualties from the battlefield to medical treatment facilities during combat operations. Determining which MEDEVAC units to task to respond to incoming requests for service, known as the MEDEVAC dispatching problem, is a natural sequential decision making problem and is the focus of this paper. Unlike previous research in this area, this paper incorporates triage classification errors and the possibility of having blood transfusion kits on board select MEDEVAC units. A discounted, infinite-horizon continuous-time Markov decision process model is formulated to examine the MEDEVAC dispatching problem and to compare generated dispatching policies to the currently practiced United States military policy. We utilize an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) technique that leverages a random forest value function approximation within an approximate policy iteration algorithmic framework to develop high-quality policies for both small-scale and large-scale problem instances. A representative planning scenario involving joint combat operations in South Korea is developed and utilized to investigate the differences between the various policies. Results from the analysis indicate that applying ADP techniques can improve current practices by as much as 29% with regard to a life-saving performance metric. This research is of particular interest to the military medical community and can inform the procedures of future military MEDEVAC operations.

AB In an attempt to improve the analysis DNA sequence, a new intelligent deep analysis algorithm called reduce frequency bast on fast frequency graph mining (RF-FFGM) is established; This algorithm at the beginning converts the DNA sequence into RNA sequences after that split these sequence into multi sub-sequence through determined specific equation for start and end point of each sequence. After that each subsequence represent as subgraph after label to the bonds between each pair of components related to RNA (i.e., A, G, U, C) these bounds include 16 labels used as Knowledge Constructions (KC)) for this work. After that apply the steps of FFGM that select after deep analysis to graph mining techniques (GSpan, FFSM, Hybrid-Tree-Miner, Approximate Frequent Sub-graph, CloGraMi and FFSM) this analysis focus on determined (the main programming steps, main parameters, advantages, disadvantages) for each algorithm. We discovery FFGM finds the frequent in a short time, because it building matrix code for con-nection edge and transforming matrices into incidence matrix, also; we found FFGM can get all the edges that have the highest contact with the other edges, so from the second stage therefore it avoids us from going through a sequential path to find duplicate edges. RF-FFGM appears as a pragmatic algorithm, it proves their robust to work with DNA sequence to reduce the computation and time.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ID MEDICAL COSTS; DIAGNOSIS; IMPACT
AB Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) sufferers have one of the highest disability-adjusted life years. The entire knee joint is affected by KOA. KOA is a condition that makes it hard for the knee to move normally. In KOA, the damage to the joints is irreversible, and the only treatment is a total knee replacement (TKR), which is expensive and only lasts a short time, especially for obese people. The individual's social isolation and low quality of life are significant outcomes of KOA. Despite being time-consuming and highly subject to user variation, segmentation, manual diagnosis, and annotation of knee joints are still the most com-mon procedure used in clinical practices to diagnose osteoarthritis. To overcome the above limitations of the previously mentioned widely used procedure and reduce diagnostic errors made by doctors, we pro-posed a fine-tuning KOA diagnosis model using the DenseNet169 deep learning (DL) technique to improve the efficiency of KOA diagnosis. Our model will reduce the cost of diagnosis, speed up diagnosis, and delay disease progression, enhancing the procedure from the patient's perspective. The proposed model will determine the degree of KOA diseases by making multi-classification and binary classifica-tions of the KOA severity. It will successfully localize the opacities' peripheral, diffuse distribution, and vascular thickening. Therefore, the proposed model would enable clinicians to understand the primary causes of KOA through this localization. We evaluated the proposed model over the OAI dataset. The OAI dataset was pre-processed by artifact removal, resizing, contrast handling, and a normalization tech-nique. The proposed model was evaluated and compared with recent classifiers. In multi-classification, the DenseNet169 model achieved 95.93%, 88.77%, 95.41%, 85.8%, and 87.08% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score, respectively. In binary classification, the accuracy, sensitivity, speci-ficity, precision, and the F1-score of the DenseNet169 model were 93.78%, 91.29%, 91.29%, 87.57%, and 89.27%, respectively. Therefore, the proposed model is an unrivaled perceptive outcome with tuning as opposed to other ongoing existing frameworks.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Deep analysis of genomic data reveals that many deadly diseases are generated due to genetic mutation. To make the health care system more robust, a machine learning researcher's prime intention is to classify the genomic data more efficiently within less time. As the genomic data suffers from the malediction of excessive dimensionality, the selection of the notable genes is always a big challenge for the researcher. The selection of prominent genomic key attributes by any nature-inspired learning algorithm always remains a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP-Hard) problem. Therefore, there is always a scope to apply new algorithms. In this projected work, an improvised sine-cosine hybridized Monarch Butterfly Optimization (SC-MBO) algorithm, is embedded with the Broad Learning System (BLS), which is defined as SC-MBO-BLS, for choosing the most significant genes and classifying the genomic data simultaneously. Initially, Kernel-based Fisher Score (K-FS) is applied to select notable genes. Then, the selected genes further undergoes for execution using the SC-MBO-BLS model. To prove the effectiveness of the suggested model, ten cancerous genomic data are considered. Here, several performance evaluators (i.e., precision, MCC, sensitivity, Kappa, F-score, and specificity) are applied for unbiased comparison. This presented model is compared with SC-MBO wrapped Multilayer Perceptron (SC-MBO-MLP), SC-MBO wrapped Extreme Learning Machine (SC-MBO-ELM), and SC-MBO wrapped Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (SC-MBO- KELM) and yields the highest accuracy in ten datasets such as 100%, 98.4%, 99%, 99.6%, 100, 97.2%, 100%, 100%, 98.6%, 99.5% in Leukemia, Colon tumor, Breast cancer, Ovarian cancer, Lymphoma-3, MLL, ALL-AML-3, SRBCT, ALL-AML-4 and Lung cancer respectively. Further, the existing twenty standard models are taken for comparison with the suggested model. Additionally, to assess the presented model, a statistical method i.e., Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is considered. As per the above quantitative and qualitative estimation, it is deduced that the suggested SC-MBO-BLS approach outclasses other considering models.(c) 2023 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

AB Trust-based service management in IoT systems, a promising research direction provides an intelligent solution for the identification of appropriate and trustworthy service providers from a huge of number smart nodes providing similar services. An efficient trust-based service ranking scheme (TBSRS) is pro-posed. The novelty of our design lies in providing accurate trust evaluation and service ranking in the absence of assessment data or presence of untrustworthiness recommendations. TBSRS also addresses the issue about the trustworthiness evaluation of a new service. Service providers are ranking based on the binary fruit fly optimization algorithm in TBSRS. The experimental results demonstrate desirable convergence, accuracy, and resiliency properties of TBSRS, and also demonstrate that TBSRS outperforms Adaptive IoT Trust and IoT-HiTrust in terms of the precision of service selection and other a few perfor-mance metrics.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

DE Opportunistic networks; Trust model; Routing algorithm
AB Opportunistic networks are self-organizing dynamic networks that use the communication opportunities presented by node movement to enable data delivery. Due to the indirect nature of inter-node connec-tions and dynamic topology, opportunistic networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks, which poses a great challenge to their security. In this paper, we first propose a trust-based model for the secure routing of opportunistic networks (TBMOR), which incorporates forwarding positive degree (FP) and node activ-ity degree (NA) into the calculation of trust value, evaluates nodes in the network by a dynamic combi-nation of direct trust and indirect trust, and then optimizes the next node list using trust values and pruning strategies. Secondly, this paper extends the network life cycle by dynamically setting up energy thresholds to reduce network redundancy by dynamically partitioning the number of replicas using trust values.Simulation results show that compared to other routers, TBMOR can effectively resist malicious attacks, has a higher message delivery rate and lower transmission latency than other routers.

AB Novice programmers struggle to comprehend specific programming constructs such as arrays, recursion, and loops. One way to address this challenge is to provide practice problems for students in these topics that are considered difficult to comprehend - such as nested loops. It is proven that practice aids program comprehension, hence, since it is time consuming to manually create many practice problems; synthesising these problems is an Expert Artificial Intelligence Task that is worth investigating. In this paper we present the synthesis of nested loop exercises in Python for practice using a context-free grammar. We defined the grammar rules for modeling program templates. Algorithms were designed and implemented for the generation of structurally different nested loop exercises based on the defined production rules of the context-free grammar. Each program generated consists of two or more looping statements, with a nesting, and the context-free grammar rules also allow for the spawning of infinitely many sub-loops for every loop. We checked for the correctness of the synthesised nested loop programs with an experimental procedure of iteratively supplying these programs to the Python interpreter. The first 120,000 iterations returned no syntactic bugs, hence, showing that these programs do compile and have outputs. Furthermore, an evaluation of the programs was carried out in a survey with 210 participants (novice and expert programmers). The results of the evaluation show that over 82% of the participants agreed that the synthesised exercises were correctly generated, solvable and can be used as practice exercises for novice programmers in introductory programming modules. 120,000 iterations of synthesised loop programs can be found at:https://tinyurl.com/nestedloops2021.

AB In an emergency, predicting the evolution trends of network public opinion is of great significance for governments to manage the situation and associated social public opinion trends. Most of the existing public opinion prediction models have the disadvantages of long time consumption, limited types of pre-dicted public opinion categories and low-accuracy prediction results. To improve the ability to predict the evolutionary trend of complex public opinion, an improved multiobjective gray wolf optimizer (IMOGWO) is proposed. IMOGWO uses logistic and Lotka-Volterra models to initialize the wolf popula-tion and improve the population validity; it designs a nonlinear function to adjust the population update factor to improve the exploration and exploitation ability and the local search ability of the wolf popu-lation; and it introduces the elite retention policy and a Pareto-optimal solution set to achieve multiple objectives using the principle of a nondominated solution set. In simulation experiments, various net-work emergencies were taken as empirical analysis cases. The experimental results show that the improved multiobjective GWO has good accuracy and universality on complex public opinion evolution prediction and can better predict the evolution trends of various types of complex public opinion than other tested methods.(c) 2023 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

AB Real-time algorithms have to adapt and adjust to new incoming patterns to provide timely and accurate responses. This paper presents a new distributed forecasting algorithm for streaming time series called StreamWNN. StreamWNN starts with an offline stage in which a forecasting model based on tuples of information fusion is created with historical data. In particular, this model consists of the fusion of patterns composed of past values of the time series with the future values of their k-nearest neighbors. Afterwards, streaming data starts to arrive. The model is incrementally updated in the online stage using a buffer with streaming data that more accurately matches the current model patterns. The model can be updated daily, monthly, quarterly or based on error thresholds. The methodology has been applied to Spanish electricity demand time series providing more accurate results when the model is updated incrementally. The best error results are obtained with the daily update of the model, resulting in an error between 2% and 3.5% depending on the prediction horizon. The model provides better error results than other algorithms.

DE T-conditional possibility; Minimum specificity; Coherence; Independence
ID PROBABILITIES; COHERENCE
AB The consequences of Dubois and Prade's minimum specificity principle are shown under a continuous t-norm T, when dealing with conditioning and independence in possibility theory. The minimum specificity principle singles out a particular sub-class of T-conditional possibilities (referred to as T-DP-conditional possibilities) adhering to a suitable axiomatic definition that relies on the residuum of T. Such a sub-class differentiates from the larger class of T-conditional possibilities in terms of non-closure with respect to pointwise limits, non-connectedness of extension sets, and Kolmogorov-like representation. We then switch to coherence for a partial assessment in both frameworks, highlighting that, under T-DP-conditioning, coherence of the global assessment cannot be characterized in terms of coherence on every finite sub-family. Finally, both for Tconditioning and T-DP-conditioning, we introduce an independence notion that implies logical independence and we investigate the differences due to minimum specificity. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Mixed membership community detection is a challenging problem in network analysis. Previous spectral clustering algorithms for this problem are developed based on the adjacency matrix instead of regularized Laplacian matrix. To close this gap, under the popular mixed membership stochastic blockmodels (MMSB), this article proposes two efficient spectral clustering algorithms based on an application of the regularized Laplacian matrix, the Simplex Regularized Spectral Clustering (SRSC) algorithm, and the Cone Regularized Spectral Clustering (CRSC) algorithm. SRSC and CRSC are developed based on the simplex structure and the cone structure in the variants of the eigendecomposition of the regularized Laplacian matrix. We show that these two approaches SRSC and CRSC are asymptotically consistent under mild conditions by providing error bounds for the estimated membership vector of each node under MMSB. These two proposed approaches are successfully applied to synthetic and empirical networks with encouraging results compared with some benchmark methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Automatic and accurate detection of covert brain infarcts may help identify individuals at risk of cogni-tive decline, dementia, and vascular events who could be eligible for early preventive measures or enroll-ment in clinical trials. We propose a novel deep learning-based framework to detect covert brain infarcts from multiple MRI sequences, including T1-weighted and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recov-ery (FLAIR) scans. First, we design a simple yet effective cross-sequence registration method to register T1 and FLAIR by slice-level and pixel-level alignment. The accurate registration enables different sequences to share the infarct annotations. Second, we employ a fully convolutional one-stage object detector for each sequence to obtain infarct candidates. The exploitation of the contextual information of adjacent slices and the elimination of predefining anchor boxes and proposals can achieve high sensitivity with computational efficiency. Finally, we propose a multi-sequence fusion strategy with attention mecha-nisms to jointly combine different sequences so that their complementary representation can be explored to reduce false positives. The attention mechanisms are designed to consider the importance of different sequences, spatial locations, and channels. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we con-struct a novel dataset with 264 cases and 738 brain infarcts with pixel-level annotations. Extensive experiments are conducted on this dataset and the results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art infarct detection performance with a sensitivity of over 80% and less than 5 false posi-tives per case.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the new technological issues of this century is cybersecurity in the health domain. Numerous types of research have been undertaken recently to identify weak points and gaps in healthcare facilities' and hospitals' cyber-resilience. Also, different evaluation techniques are used to identify cyber-defense tactics and mitigation methods. During a crisis, however, the health sector is not immune to scientific or professional advancement since it must concentrate all of its resources to treating patients and saving lives. Thus, we proposed Multi Step Convolutional neural network Stacked Long short term memory architecture (MSCSL) for attack detection in Internet of Things detection (IoT) based healthcare applications. Here, using Light Spectrum Optimizer (LSO) the MSCSL's hyperparameter is optimized. The designed activation function combines the best features of the rectified Liner Unit (ReLU), which is more data-adaptive and has a lower computation complexity. In MSCSL architecture the ReLU is replaced with the Leaky Learnable ReLU (LeLeLU) to improve the data adaptability and minimize the computational complexity. The proposed model is evaluated based on different datasets such as the ECU-Internet of Health Things (IoHT), TON-IoT, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition International Electrotechnical Commission (SCADA IEC 60870-5-104) datasets. This dataset includes port scans, brute force, and DoS attacks. When evaluated using different metrics, the proposed method achieves a precision of 98.5%, accuracy of 98.85%, F1-score of 98.74%, recall of 96.3%, Kappa score of 98.9%, and Mathew Correlation coefficient (MCC) values of 0.92, which is higher compared to other existing techniques.

AB We formulate the manifold learning problem as the problem of finding an operator that maps any point to a close neighbor that lies on a "hidden" k-dimensional manifold. We call this operator the correcting function. Under this formulation, autoencoders can be viewed as a tool to approximate the correcting function. Given an autoencoder whose Jacobian has rank k , we deduce from the classical Constant Rank Theorem that its range has a structure of a k-dimensional manifold. A k-dimensionality of the range can be forced by the architecture of an autoencoder (by fixing the dimension of the code space), or alternatively, by an additional constraint that the rank of the autoencoder mapping is not greater than k . This constraint is included in the objective function as a new term, namely a squared Ky-Fan k-antinorm of the Jacobian function. We claim that this constraint is a factor that effectively reduces the dimension of the range of an autoencoder, additionally to the reduction defined by the architecture. We also add a new curvature term into the objective. To conclude, we experimentally compare our approach with the CAE+H method on synthetic and real-world datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this work, a novel distributed privacy-aware person search (PAPS) model has been proposed which circumvents the privacy risks. An intelligent IoT surveillance system has been designed to integrate the PAPS model for real-time distributed privacy-aware person search from surveillance videos. An important aspect of the intelligent surveillance system, particularly person search, is the visual feedback at the output, with ranked results of person images at the user-end. Therefore, even if edge processing is performed, there is still a need to store and transmit the cropped person images to the cloud server for displaying the results at the user-end. However, storing or transmission of videos/images to cloud-servers leads to privacy issues. The proposed PAPS model eliminates the need to store or transmit the images/videos while performing person search, thereby addressing the privacy concerns. The proposed system is easily scalable to incorporate more camera nodes to enhance the surveillance coverage as majority of the processing is performed at the edge servers, with a small amount of fog-processing. A very minimal amount of cloud-processing is performed only when a query is raised at the user-end. Only the processed and encoded data is transmitted across the edge, fog and the cloud servers, which protects privacy and significantly reduces bandwidth costs. Further, a new evaluation criterion, Person Capacity, has been proposed to evaluate the feasibility of an edge-based system to be deployed at crowded locations. The performance evaluation of our system, on our own video dataset, as well as the PRW, and CUHK-SYSU dataset for person search demonstrates that the proposed system achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while performing in real-time for practical scenarios.

DE Black-box NLP attack; Explainable AI; Peaks clustering synonyms search
AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successful in solving real-world tasks in domains such as connected and automated vehicles, disease, and job hiring. However, their implications are far-reaching in critical application areas. Hence, there is a growing concern regarding the potential bias and robustness of these DNN models. A transparency and robust model is always demanded in high-stakes domains where reliability and safety are enforced, such as healthcare and finance. While most studies have focused on adversarial image attack scenarios, fewer studies have investigated the robustness of DNN models in natural language processing (NLP) due to their adversarial samples are difficult to generate. To address this gap, we propose a word-level NLP classifier attack model called "AED," which stands for Attention mechanism enabled post-model Explanation with Density peaks clustering algorithm for synonyms search and substitution. AED aims to test the robustness of NLP DNN models by interpretability their weaknesses and exploring alternative ways to optimize them. By identifying vulnerabilities and providing explanations, AED can help improve the reliability and safety of DNN models in critical application areas such as healthcare and automated transportation. Our experiment results demonstrate that compared with other existing models, AED can effectively generate adversarial examples that can fool the victim model while maintaining the original meaning of the input.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI EARR: Using rules to enhance the embedding of knowledge graph

   enhanced knowledge graph embedding
AB Knowledge graphs have been receiving increasing attention from researchers. However, most of these graphs are incomplete, leading to the rise of knowledge graph completion as a prominent task. The goal of knowledge graph completion is to find missing relations in a knowledge graph. Knowledge graph embedding represents the entities and relations in a low-dimensional embedding space, simplifying operations and allowing for integration with knowledge graph completion tasks. Several popular embedding models, such as TransE, TransH, TransR, TuckER, RotatE, and others have achieved impressive results on knowledge graph completion tasks. However, most of these methods do not incorporate background knowledge that could enhance the quality of knowledge embedding. Logic rules are adaptable and scalable, which can enrich background knowledge, and separating the attributes of entities can improve the relevance of relations and facilitate the accuracy of logic rule extraction. Thus, we propose a novel method, named Entity-Attribute-Relation-Rule (EARR), which separates attributes from entities and uses logic rules to extend the dataset, improving the accuracy of knowledge graph completion tasks. We define a total of six rules in this paper, including Rule 1-3, Rule 5, and Rule 6 for entities, and Rule 4 for entities and attributes. We evaluate our method based on the task of link prediction through two kinds of experiments. In the basic experiment, we compare our method with three benchmark models, namely, TransE, TransH, and TransR. In the experiment with different size datasets, FB24K and CoDEx, we evaluate our method on different size datasets with different models, including TransE, TuckER, and RotatE. The experimental results indicate that EARR can improve the quality of knowledge graph embedding.

AB This work aims to improve fuel chamber injectors' performance in turbofan engines, thus implying improved performance and reduction of pollutants. This requires the development of models that allow real-time prediction and improvement of the fuel/air mixture. However, the work carried out to date involves using experimental data (complicated to measure) or the numerical resolution of the complete problem (computationally prohibitive). The latter involves the resolution of a system of partial differential equations (PDE). These problems make difficult to develop a real-time prediction tool. Therefore, in this work, we propose using machine learning in conjunction with (complementarily cheaper) single-phase flow numerical simulations in the presence of tangential discontinuities to estimate the mixing process in two-phase flows. In this meaning we study the application of two proposed neural network (NN) models1 as PDE surrogate models. Where the future dynamics is predicted by the NN, given some preliminary information. We show the low computational cost required by these models, both in their training and inference phases. We also show how NN training can be improved by reducing data complexity through a modal decomposition technique called higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), which identifies the main structures inside flow dynamics and reconstructs the original flow using only these main structures. This reconstruction has the same number of samples and spatial dimension as the original flow, but with a less complex dynamics and preserving its main features. The core idea of this work is to test the limits of applicability of deep learning models to data forecasting in complex fluid dynamics problems. Generalization capabilities of the models are demonstrated by using the same NN architectures to forecast the future dynamics of four different two-phase flows.

DT Article
DE Conditional face image generation; Top-k ranking; Domain alignment;
   Optimal Transport
AB Despite the great success of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in face image generation, it is still a challenge to generate a faithful yet high-fidelity face image given an exemplar image and a conditional input from a distinct domain (e.g., a semantic segmentation mask or an edge map). Existing methods learn image level features to align distinct domains in an intermediate domain, which ignore the spatial relationship of the facial semantic parts and therefore lead to semantic mismatching problems. In addition, it is computationally expensive to establish dense correspondences in the intermediate domain, especially for high-resolution face images. To address these problems, we propose a novel attention guided domain alignment method for conditional face image generation, which aligns two domains directly under the guidance of the local attention learned from semantically similar face parts. In particular, we assign a dedicated index for each feature block and adopt a top-k ranking operation to correspond block-wise features in two distinct domains, which exploits the spatial relationship of facial parts and preserves the texture structure during alignment. The local attention is then learned from the retrieved blocks, which reduces computation complexity substantially and therefore enables to build alignment in a high resolution. The aligned features are finally fused with adaptive weights learned from their long-range correlation coefficients, which capture the semantic coherence of the style features between the two domains. Extensive experimental results on the CelebAMask-HQ dataset demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Mobile devices such as smartphones and smartwatches are part of our everyday life, acquiring large amount of personal information that needs to be properly secured. Among the different authentication techniques, behavioural biometrics has become a very popular method as it allows authentication in a non-intrusive and continuous way. This study proposes M-GaitFormer, a novel mobile biometric gait verification system based on Transformer architectures. This biometric system only considers the accelerometer and gyroscope data acquired by the mobile device. A complete analysis of the proposed M-GaitFormer is carried out using the popular available databases whuGAIT and OU-ISIR. M-GaitFormer achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) values of 3.42% and 2.90% on whuGAIT and OU-ISIR, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches based on popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

AB The use of machine-learning methods helps to improve decision-making in different fields. In particular, the idea of bridging predictions (predictive models) and prescriptions (optimization problems) is gaining attention within the scientific community. One of the main ideas to address this trade-off is the Constraint Learning (CL) methodology, where the structure of the machine learning model can be treated as a set of constraints to be embedded within the optimization problem, establishing the relationship between a direct decision variable x and a response variable y. However, most CL approaches have focused on making point predictions, not considering the statistical and external uncertainty faced in the modeling process. In this paper, we extend the CL methodology to deal with uncertainty in the response variable y. The novel Distributional Constraint Learning (DCL) methodology makes use of a piece-wise linearizable neural network-based model to estimate the parameters of the conditional distribution of y (dependent on decisions x and contextual information), which can be embedded within mixed-integer optimization problems. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem by sampling random values from the estimated distribution by using a linear set of constraints. In this sense, DCL combines both the predictive performance of the neural network method and the possibility of generating scenarios to account for uncertainty within a tractable optimization model. The behavior of the proposed methodology is tested in the context of electricity systems, where a Virtual Power Plant seeks to optimize its operation, subject to different forms of uncertainty, and with price-responsive consumers.

Therefore, it is crucial to effectively utilize the unique characteristics of unclear edges in hazy underwater images to achieve high-performance results in real-time applications. In this paper, we exploit such features as edges and visual perception in underwater haze images. To achieve this, we estimate the true transmission of the image by enhancing the visibility of discontinuous edges using the reverse gamma correction based on the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model. The parameters of the GARCH model are defined by the local and global pixel dynamics in adjacent neighborhoods, which improves the color orientation of the image while preserving image details. Additionally, we perform deseasoning to separate pixels while maintaining the natural contours of interactions between them. By considering the volatility of the RGB color channels, we predict the variance of the pixels based on the difference of the deseasoned pixels, which improves pixel intensity and allows for scene depth estimation. While estimating gamma correction and global ambient light, we deseasonalize image pixels based on their colors, enhancing the color of the final dehazed images. Using the greedy algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), our proposed method outperforms commonly used state-of-the-art methods.

AB The objective of our study is to observe dynamics of multiple substances in vivo with high temporal resolution from multi-spectral magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data. The multi-spectral MRSI can effectively separate spectral peaks of multiple substances and is useful to measure spatial distributions of substances. However it is difficult to measure time-varying substance distributions directly by ordinary full sampling because the measurement requires a significantly long time. In this study, we propose a novel method to reconstruct the spatio-temporal distributions of substances from randomly undersampled multi-spectral MRSI data on the basis of compressed sensing (CS) and the partially separable function model with base spectra of substances. In our method, we have employed spatio-temporal sparsity and temporal smoothness of the substance distributions as prior knowledge to perform CS. By directly reconstructing the spatio-temporal distributions of the substances themselves without reconstructing the spectra, this method significantly reduces the amount of MRSI data required per single time frame. We have formulated a regularized minimization problem for reconstruction and solved it by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The effectiveness of our method has been evaluated using phantom data sets of glass tubes filled with glucose or lactate solution in increasing amounts over time and animal data sets of a tumor-bearing mouse to observe the metabolic dynamics involved in the Warburg effect in vivo. The reconstructed results are consistent with the expected behaviors, showing that our method can reconstruct the spatio-temporal distribution of substances with a temporal resolution of four seconds which is extremely short time scale compared with that of full sampling. Since this method utilizes only prior knowledge naturally assumed for the spatio-temporal distributions of substances and is independent of the number of the spectral and spatial dimensions or the acquisition sequence of MRSI, it is expected to contribute to revealing the underlying substance dynamics in MRSI data already acquired or to be acquired in the future.

AB Social networks have become an essential part of daily life, and hence every real-world activity finds its place in this virtual world. The present paper proposes a methodology to find localized micro-events from the social network stream. The method is named CommunityINDICATOR. A concept of 'separation of concerns' from the software design principle is incorporated in the methodology to reduce the execution time drastically from existing state-of-the-art methods of event detection. In order to reduce the execution time, the algorithm first generates an interaction graph from the social stream and applies community detection followed by a clustering algorithm onto it to detect micro-level events. Experiments have been conducted on Twitter data stream of 5 different cities on three different continents with the size of 2 million tweets. We have used well known quality metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and execution time to compare performance with other state-of-the-art methodologies. The proposed CommunityINDICATOR provides up to 30% higher accuracy than EvenTweet and SEDTWik in similar execution times. An improvement of 11% to 51% and 17% to 57% in execution time is observed for the proposed algorithm in comparison with TwiiterNews and EventX, respectively, for different datasets.

DE Arch dams; Deformation; Structural health monitoring; Convolutional

ID TEMPERATURE; MODELS
AB Deformation directly reflects the behavior of arch dams, and deformation behavior models have been widely used for structural health monitoring (SHM) in accordance with monitoring data. The deformation field brings advantages to the SHM of arch dams in terms of the spatiotemporal scale. In this paper, a spatiotemporal deformation field behavior model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed. The temperature field of the dam fusing the climatological data, including air temperature, weather conditions, and solar radiation, was introduced. Furthermore, the water pressure and constraint fields were also input into the CNNbased model. The physical law and structural continuity were considered, and the parameters of the CNN-based model were general and uniform for each predicted location. The accuracy and extrapolation ability of the proposed model were evaluated. The results illustrate that the CNN-based model predicts accurate deformation at the spatiotemporal scale of the arch dam. The accuracy of the prediction of single-point deformation time series from the CNN-based model is close to that from the traditional hydraulic-seasonal-time (HST) model and finite element model (FEM). For the prediction of the spatial deformation field, the mean MAE of the CNN-based model is 2.68 mm, while it is 5.66 mm for the FEM model, showing much higher prediction accuracy of the CNNbased model. The proposed globally uniform CNN-based model can derive a high-precision and high-density deformation field of arch dams with sparse monitoring data. It can also be continuously updated in real-time according to the latest monitoring data without inverse analysis and parameter adjustment like the FEM model.

AB As a promising solution to alleviate the critical cold-start problem in recommendation systems, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) aims to transfer users' preferences from the source domain to the target domain. However, the negligence of semantic differences of heterogeneous relations when modeling user preferences and the non-consideration of a user's common characteristics inferred from similar users when transferring the user's preferences make recent CDR works cannot well handle the two core issues of CDR-'what to transfer' and 'how to transfer'. To this end, we propose a novel heterogeneous and clustering-enhanced user preference transfer model for CDR (named HCCDR). To well address the first issue, the heterogeneous latent factor modeling component is firstly built to compute high-quality representations of users and items to be transferred based on the heterogeneous relations among users and items. Note that the heterogeneous relations with different semantics are processed with different models. Then, the clustering-enhanced preference transfer component well addresses the second issue by learning an effective personalized preference transfer function between two domains for a user, where the individual and common characteristics of the user are concurrently considered. Finally, the personalized recommendation component achieves the personalized recommendation in the target domain based on the transferred user embeddings calculated via the learned personalized preference transfer functions. Experimental results performed on large public datasets demonstrate that the proposed HCCDR markedly outperforms all baselines. In particular, HCCDR gains a maximum performance improvement of 12.69% (or 8.99%) for RMSE (or MAE) compared with the best baseline.

AB With the growing popularity of social media and an outburst of malicious tampering methods, it has become easier than ever to mislead others and create disharmony in society by manipulating social media content. Hence, there is an urgent need to build robust manipulation detection systems. This manuscript proposes a novel end-toend architecture that extracts discriminative "manipulation residuals" (MR) and "textural" (T) features for facial manipulation detection. Most multi-branch architectures suffer from a common flaw in their fusion stage, where they combine multi-domain features in equal proportion. This is disadvantageous since each feature may not be equally important in making the final prediction. MRT-Net solves this problem by implementing an autoadaptive weighting mechanism to select an ideal proportion of manipulation residual and textural information that prove complementary to one another. Specifically, two weighting factors for the MR and T features, & PROP;1 and & PROP;2 are added as parameters to the proposed neural network and are updated automatically via backpropagation, thereby allowing MRT-Net to find the ideal mix of residual and textural information. Additionally, MRT-Net benefits from a channel attention mechanism that boosts its performance even further. MRT-Net achieves excellent performance on three public benchmark datasets, Deep Fake Detection Challenge (DFDC), CelebDF and FaceForensics++ (FF++). AUC scores achieved are 0.9964 on DFDC, 0.9921 on CelebDF, 0.9910 on FF++ (DeepFake), 0.9974 on FF++(Face2Face), 0.9942 on FF++(FaceShifter), 0.9933 on FF++(FaceSwap) and 0.9662 on FF++(NeuralTextures). It also achieves accuracy scores of 0.9760 on DFDC, 0.9815 on CelebDF, 0.9670 on FF++(DeepFake), 0.9767 on FF++(Face2Face), 0.9611 on FF++(FaceShifter), 0.9676 on FF++ (FaceSwap) and 0.9025 on FF++(NeuralTextures). These excellent results demonstrate MRT-Net's potency as it comfortably outperforms other state-of-the-art face manipulation detection methods.

AB Outlier detection is an important research topic in data mining and machine learning. However, existing unsupervised outlier detection methods suffer from irrelevant and redundant attributes in high-dimensional data, and their performance is also limited by their outlier detection models that rely on only one view. In this study, we propose a three-way decision-based co-detection model for unsupervised outlier detection. Specifically, we first improve the local outlier factor (LOF) method by introducing the Gaussian kernel function to make the measure of local reachability density more accurate. Then, we introduce fuzzy rough sets to perform attribute reduction, which further reduces the negative effect of irrelevant and redundant attributes on the measure of sample similarity. Finally, we develop a co-detection model that is trained on the original view and the transformed view generated by principal component analysis and uses the strategy of the three-way decision to collaboratively detect outliers. The results of comparative experiments on the selected UCI datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC-ROC index.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Most existing unsupervised video domain adaptation methods focus on extracting frame-level features and using temporal attention to create a domain-invariant feature space. However, this ignores the importance of different image regions and temporal dynamics. In this study, we propose a method that considers both frame-level and image-region level alignment to learn a dual spatial and temporal domain-invariant feature space. This is achieved by: 1) extracting frame-level image features and align-ing them into a domain-invariant latent feature space; 2) extracting region-level temporal features and aligning them into a domain-invariant latent feature space. Optimal frame-level correlation is achieved through video-frame level alignment, while optimal image-region level correlation is demonstrated through image-region level alignment between the source and target videos. We use an LSTM network to parameterize this dual feature alignment, which is more efficient than attention mechanisms and results in significantly improved performance and reduced GPU memory cost by over 40% compared to current state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Position detection of hydraulic cylinder pistons is crucial for numerous industrial automation applications. A typical traditional method is to excite electromagnetic waves in the cylinder structure and analytically solve the piston position based on the scattering parameters measured by a sensor. The core of this approach is a physical model that outlines the relationship between the measured scattering parameters and the targeted piston position. However, this physical model has shortcomings in accuracy and adaptability, especially in extreme conditions. To address these limitations, we propose machine learning and deep learning-based methods to learn the relationship directly in a data-driven manner. As a result, all deep learning models in this paper consistently outperform the physical one by a large margin. We further deliberate on the choice of models based on domain knowledge and provide in-depth analyses combining model performance with real-world physical characteristics. Specifically, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to discover local interactions of input among adjacent frequencies, apply Complex-Valued Neural Network (CVNN) to exploit the complex-valued nature of electromagnetic scattering parameters, and introduce a novel technique named Frequency Encoding to add weighted frequency information to the model input. The combination of these techniques results in our best-performing model, a complex-valued CNN with Frequency Encoding, which exhibits substantial improvement in accuracy with an error reduction of 1/12 compared to the traditional physical model.

ID GENERAL FRAMEWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; EFFICIENT
AB Recent unsupervised dimension reduction algorithms use similarity graphs between data point pairs to preserve local structure while reducing dimension. However, the time complexity of these methods is proportional to the square of the number of samples, which limits their application to large-scale datasets. Moreover, the square Euclidean calculation criterion between sample point pairs will magnify the bad influence of outliers on the graph. In addition, these methods only preserve the local structure while losing other important structural information. To this end, we propose a fast adaptive unsupervised projection model termed Fast and Robust Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction with Adaptive Bipartite Graph (FRUDR-ABG), which uses a few anchor points and sample points to build a bipartite graph to preserve the local geometric structure of the data to reduce the running time and improve efficiency. We propose a criterion based on the l2,1 norm to calculate the distance between anchor points and data points to reduce the negative influence of outliers on graph construction. A practical strategy is also proposed to realize joint learning of global and local structures. According to the characteristics of graph construction and dimensionality reduction adaptive learning in the algorithm, we design an iterative reweighting method to solve the model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that FRUDR-ABG has higher efficiency and recognition performance than existing unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The distributed assembly flow shop scheduling (DAFS) problem has received much attention in the last decade, and a variety of metaheuristic algorithms have been developed to achieve the high-quality solution. However, there are still some limitations. On the one hand, these studies usually ignore the machine deterioration, maintenance, transportation as well as the flexibility of flow shops. On the other hand, metaheuristic algorithms are prone to fall into local optimality and are unstable in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems. Therefore, a multi-population memetic algorithm (MPMA) with Q-learning (MPMA-QL) is developed to address a distributed assembly hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with flexible preventive maintenance (DAHFSP-FPM). Specifically, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model targeted at the minimal makespan is first established, followed by an effective flexible maintenance strategy to simplify the model. To efficiently solve the model, MPMA is developed and Q-learning is used to achieve an adaptive individual assignment for each subpopulation to improve the performance of MPMA. Finally, two state-of-the-art metaheuristics and their Qlearning-based improvements are selected as rivals of the developed MPMA and MPMA-QL. A series of numerical studies are carried out along with a real-life case of a furniture manufacturing company, to demonstrate that MPMA-QL can provide better solutions on the studied DAHFSP-FPM..

AB Distributed localization in wireless sensor networks is essential for verifying the positions of the sensor nodes deployed in the sensing field based on information interactions. However, the information trans-mitted from the controller to the actuator for each sensor node may be lost owing to communication noise, channel interference, or network congestion. With this in mind, this paper aims at investigating the distributed localization for wireless sensor networks subject to random lossy links. The barycentric coordinate, which can be determined by the distance measurements between node pairs in the network, is used as the basic scheme for range-based localization. First, based on the characterization of random link loss in wireless sensor networks with a Bernoulli random variable, a distributed iterative localization algorithm is proposed. And then, the global convergence of the proposed localization algorithm which ensures accurate localization is theoretically proved by using the convergence of sub-stochastic matrices' product. Finally, numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed local-ization algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The attention mechanism empowers deep learning to a broader range of applications, but the contribution of the attention module is highly controversial. Research on modern Hopfield networks indicates that the attention mechanism can also be used in shallow networks. Its automatic sample filtering facilitates instance extraction in Multiple Instances Learning tasks. Since the attention mechanism has a clear contribution and intuitive performance in shallow networks, this paper further investigates its optimization method based on the recurrent neural network. Through comprehensive comparison, we find that the Synergetic Neural Network has the advantage of more accurate and controllable convergences and revertible converging steps. Therefore, we design the Syn layer based on the Synergetic Neural Network and propose the novel invertible activation function as the forward and backward update formula for attention weights concentration or distraction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms other methods in all Multiple Instances Learning benchmark datasets. Concentration improves the robustness of the results, while distraction expands the instance observing space and yields better results. Codes available at https://github.com/wzh134/Syn.

AB As for the problems of boundary blurring and information loss in the multi-focus image fusion method based on the generative decision maps, this paper proposes a new gradient-intensity joint proportional constraint generative adversarial network for multi-focus image fusion, with the name of GIPC-GAN. First, a set of labeled multi-focus image datasets using the deep region competition algorithm on a public dataset is constructed. It can train the network and generate fused images in an end-to-end manner, while avoiding boundary errors caused by artificially constructed decision maps. Second, the most meaningful information in the multi-focus image fusion task is defined as the target intensity and detail gradient, and a jointly constrained loss function based on intensity and gradient proportional maintenance is proposed. Constrained by a specific loss function to force the generated image to retain the information of target intensity, global texture and local texture of the source image as much as possible and maintain the structural consistency between the fused image and the source image. Third, we introduce GAN into the network, and establish an adversarial game between the generator and the discriminator, so that the intensity structure and texture gradient retained by the fused image are kept in a balance, and the detailed information of the fused image is further enhanced. Last but not least, experiments are conducted on two multi-focus public datasets and a multi-source multi-focus image sequence dataset and compared with other 7 state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the images fused by the GIPC-GAN model are superior to other comparison algorithms in both subjective performance and objective measurement, and basically meet the requirements of real-time image fusion in terms of running efficiency and mode parameters quantity.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Railway track accidents continue to occur despite manual inspections, which are often inaccurate and can lead to catastrophic events. While artificial intelligence has been applied in the railway sector, few studies have focused on defect detection using object detection tools. Additionally, there is a lack of studies that compare different models using the same dataset. This paper proposes new data-driven techniques that identify railway track faults using three object detection models: YOLOv5, Faster RCNN, and EfficientDet. These models are compared by testing a dataset of 31 images that contain three different railway track elements (clip, rail, and fishplate), both faulty and non faulty. Six classes were differentiated in the training of the models: one faulty and one non-faulty for each of the three classes. Image pre-processing steps included data augmentation techniques and image resizing. Results show good precision (equivalent to 1) in detecting non-defective elements, but recall values for defective elements vary among models, with Faster RCNN performing the best (0.93), followed by EfficientDet (0.81), and YOLOv5 (0.68). The full paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of these proposed techniques for railway fault detection.

ID OPTIMAL NUMBER; INDEX; VALIDATION
AB Knowing the number of clusters a priori is one of the most challenging aspects of unsupervised learning. Clustering Internal Validity Indices (CIVIs) evaluate partitions in unsupervised algorithms based on metrics like compactness, separation, and density. However, specialized CIVIs for specific applications have been designed, and there is no general CIVI that works in all scenarios. The absence of CIVIs based on crisp uncertainty metrics is especially critical in decision-making processes that involve ambiguity, non-convex distributions, outliers, and overlapping data. To address this problem, we propose a novel Uncertainty Frechet (UF) CIVI that assesses the certainty of a well-defined partition. UF leverages uncertainty fingerprints based on Type-2 fuzzy Gaussian Mixture Models (T2FGMM) and the Frechet distance between clusters to introduce a metric that evaluates partition quality. We integrate UF into a merging methodology that combines similar clusters within a partition, allowing us to determine the number of clusters without the need to run the clustering algorithms iteratively as other CIVIs require. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of our proposal on 5,250 convex, 36 non-convex synthetic datasets, and five benchmark real datasets. In addition, we apply UF in a real-world scenario that involves high uncertainty: Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) of ecosystems, which aims to study ecological transformations through acoustic recordings. The results show that UF exhibits notable performance in synthetic and real-world scenarios, obtaining an Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) score higher than 0.88 for normal, uniform, gamma, and triangular distribution datasets. In the PAM application, UF identifies the transformation of ecosystems through sound using clustering algorithms and UF, achieving an F1 score of 0.84. Therefore, results show that the UF index is a suitable tool for researchers and practitioners working with highly uncertain data.

AB With the development of the Internet, video has become the most prevalent medium for communication among people. To improve the user experience on video networks, the study of video thumbnail generation has become an important area of exploration. In this paper, we focus on the sentence-specified dynamic video thumbnail generation(DVTG) task. It aims to select several video clips to compose video thumbnails that not only provide a compressed presentation of the video, but also match the user sentence. Existing methods rely on complex multi-modal fusion modules to select thumbnail clips, despite ignoring the semantic similarity between video clips and the coherence of the generated thumbnail. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-enhanced hierarchical network (VEH-Net) comprising the clip-guided visual-enhanced fusion module (CVFM) and a dynamic prototype thumbnail generator (DPTG). Our CVFM is designed to introduce more visual information during feature fusion to differentiate clips with similar semantic salience. The DPTG utilizes hierarchical Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLPs) to choose thumbnail clips in succession based on prototypes that contain information about previously selected clips. Additionally, we employ the captioning loss function to learn the internal relationships among the selected thumbnail clips to enhance the consistency of the generated thumbnails. Based on our VEH-Net, we also explore the unsupervised DVTG task to reduce the effect of subjective thumbnail annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms other baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance based on the dataset. The unsupervised version of our model also displays competitive performance in unsupervised experiments. All the codes can be found at .

   Attention mechanism; Periodism
AB Traffic prediction is an important link in building a smart city, accurate prediction of future traffic conditions can provide a reference for people to travel and facilitate the work of relevant departments, and is vital for urban applications. Nevertheless, due to the cyclical nature of traffic conditions and uncertain factors, as well as the spatial heterogeneity in the traffic network, it is difficult to model the dynamic temporal and spatial correlation, so traffic prediction is facing severe challenges. Existing methods usually use a dynamic graph to model and analyze traffic conditions at a certain moment, lacking consideration of spatial heterogeneity and trend changes in traffic flow, so prediction results are often unsatisfactory. To address the above challenges, we propose a Multi-scale Spatial-temporal Fusion Graph Network for Traffic Prediction framework (MFSTGN). Specifically, we design a spatial-temporal graph convolution network module (STGCN) that dynamically models spatial-temporal correlations while preserving the inherent structure of the traffic network, and describes the trend variation of traffic flows through a kind of trend graph convolution, while modeling the spatial heterogeneity of the traffic network using spatial-temporal embedding. STGCN allows MFSTGN to enjoy a perceptual field that facilitates long-term prediction. In addition, we have developed a Gated Attention mechanism that adaptively fuses cyclical dependence and trend dependence, enabling MFSTGN to enjoy multiple scale information. Experimental results on four datasets for two types of traffic prediction tasks show that MFSTGN outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline.

AB Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is significant for reliability analysis and the reduction of maintenance costs for turbofan engine systems. However, most of the existing methods capture temporal or spatial features to predict RUL, which leads to the neglect of deep spatio-temporal correlation in the prediction data. In addition, there are usually noise interference and few labels in feature extraction, which causes difficulty in designing robust RUL prediction models. To address these problems, a denoised semi-supervised model based on fully convolutional denoising autoencoder, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory network (FCDAE-CNN-LSTM) is proposed to predict RUL, where FCDAE is constructed to denoise the original data by parameter fine-tuning and CNN-LSTM is established based on parallel connection for RUL prognosis. The denoising and generalization capabilities of the RUL prediction model are enhanced by the combination of unsupervised denoising and supervised feature extraction in the case of few labeled training data. The superior features of the method lie in that FCDAE effectively captures globalized and localized features and CNN-LSTM captures multi-layer fused spatial-temporal correlations. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Score of the proposed method on C-MAPSS dataset are 12.01, 16.62, 11.84, 18.21, and 209.44, 1466.03, 205.07, 2338.93, respectively, which have demonstrated that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other models.

TI RORNet: Partial-to-Partial Registration Network With Reliable
   Overlapping Representations
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Overlapping points' estimation; partial-to-partial registration; point
   cloud registration; reliable representations
AB Three-dimensional point cloud registration is an important field in computer vision. Recently, due to the increasingly complex scenes and incomplete observations, many partial-overlap registration methods based on overlap estimation have been proposed. These methods heavily rely on the extracted overlapping regions with their performances greatly degraded when the overlapping region extraction underperforms. To solve this problem, we propose a partial-to-partial registration network (RORNet) to find reliable overlapping representations from the partially overlapping point clouds and use these representations for registration. The idea is to select a small number of key points called reliable overlapping representations from the estimated overlapping points, reducing the side effect of overlap estimation errors on registration. Although it may filter out some inliers, the inclusion of outliers has a much bigger influence than the omission of inliers on the registration task. The RORNet is composed of overlapping points' estimation module and representations' generation module. Different from the previous methods of direct registration after extraction of overlapping areas, RORNet adds the step of extracting reliable representations before registration, where the proposed similarity matrix downsampling method is used to filter out the points with low similarity and retain reliable representations, and thus reduce the side effects of overlap estimation errors on the registration. Besides, compared with previous similarity-based and score-based overlap estimation methods, we use the dual-branch structure to combine the benefits of both, which is less sensitive to noise. We perform overlap estimation experiments and registration experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, outdoor large scene dataset KITTI, and natural data Stanford Bunny dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is superior to other partial registration methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/superYuezhang/RORNet.

TI Data-free quantization via mixed-precision compensation without

DT Article
DE Neural network compression; Date-free quantization
AB Neural network quantization is a very promising solution in the field of model compression, but its resulting accuracy highly depends on a training/fine-tuning process and requires the original data. This not only brings heavy computation and time costs but also is not conducive to privacy and sensitive information protection. Therefore, a few recent works are starting to focus on data-free quantization. However, data free quantization does not perform well while dealing with ultra-low precision quantization. Although researchers utilize generative methods of synthetic data to address this problem partially, data synthesis needs to take a lot of computation and time. In this paper, we propose a data-free mixed-precision compensation (DF-MPC) method to recover the performance of an ultra-low precision quantized model without any data and fine-tuning process. By assuming the quantized error caused by a low-precision quantized layer can be restored via the reconstruction of a high-precision quantized layer, we mathematically formulate the reconstruction loss between the pre-trained full-precision model and its layer-wise mixed-precision quantized model. Based on our formulation, we theoretically deduce the closed-form solution by minimizing the reconstruction loss of the feature maps. Since DF-MPC does not require any original/synthetic data, it is a more efficient method to approximate the full-precision model. Experimentally, our DF-MPC is able to achieve higher accuracy for an ultra-low precision quantized model compared to the recent methods without any data and fine-tuning process.(C) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently, rotating machinery fault diagnosis studies based on graph neural networks (GNN) have received some satisfactory achievements. But most of them are based on the analysis of the single sensor signals, which cannot capture the comprehensive fault information, especially aiming at large rotating machineries. A few research using GNN for multi-sensor fault diagnosis only fuse multi-source features in the construction of the input graph, and the fusion effect largely depends on the manual feature selection. Graph attention network (GAT), as an emerging GNN, can give trainable weights to vertices based on the self-attention mechanism to improve the effectiveness of feature learning. And it has not yet been used in the field of multi-sensor fault diagnosis. To fill this gap and utilize GAT's advantages, this paper presents a multi-sensor multi-head GAT (MMHGAT) model for large rotating machinery fault diagnosis. With the input of several subgraphs, the designed MMHGAT model consisting of two graph attention layers (GAL), a feature fusion process and a Softmax classifier, can dynamically fuse and mine the high-level fault characteristics during the training process. By employing the experiment on the axial flow pump, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated.

AB El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a complex coupled ocean-atmosphere event, usually manifested as an abnormal increase or decrease in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. ENSO is one of the critical factors causing global climate extremes and ecosystem turbulence. Therefore, long-term robust ENSO predictions are essential for people's productive life and social development. The statistical and dynamic models still face challenges in making long-lead-time ENSO forecasts, and the accuracy can be improved. Here, we have created three innovative efforts for ENSO forecasting: (1) To compensate for the lack of Remote Sensing (RSS) dataset, we apply transfer learning with the large SST dataset simulated from the LASG/IAP Climate Ocean Model Version 3 (LICOM3). (2) We propose a novel encoder-decoder structure with multiple Spatiotemporal prediction units (ST-Pred) named ED-PredRNN. The ST-Pred changes the original transfer direction by adding spatiotemporal memory cells, allowing the model to extract more information. (3) To reduce the memory bandwidth load, we use FP32 and FP16 mixed-precision computing methods to improve model training and inference speed.The result shows that during 2011-2020 verification period, the correlation skills of the Nino 3.4 index predicted by ED-PredRNN are over 0.77/0.64/0.53 within the lead time of 6/12/18 months respectively, which is superior to existing statistical models. Also, the precise predictions of the El Nino event (such as 2015/16) and the La Nina event (such as 2010/11), as well as a reasonable forecast for neutral ENSO conditions (2014), demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed model.

AB Background: Physician-rating sites have become a convenient platform for patients to choose doctors. However, selecting an appropriate doctor through numerous online reviews is challengeable for patients. Although studies show that patients have different preferences for the aspects of healthcare services, existing doctor ranking methods rarely consider such preference information. Besides, they seldom handle the neutral sentiment information in patient reviews.Methods: To better assist patients in doctor selection, we propose a novel decision-making method that combines aspect-based sentiment analysis, single-valued neutrosophic sets and an extended Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The method utilizes Word2Vec to construct a feature dictionary of patient satisfaction. A rule-based approach is employed to extract the aspects and the related sentiments from patients' text reviews. Moreover, it takes advantage of single-valued neutrosophic sets to address the positive, neutral and negative sentiment information. On this basis, we rank the doctors with an extended TOPSIS method considering the patient's attitudinal character and the preference information.Results: A case study on a review dataset demonstrates the stability and flexibility of the method. The comparative analysis reveals that our method can efficiently reduce information loss and it is more practical than existing methods.Conclusion: Considering patients' different preferences for the aspects of healthcare services, the method can better provide healthcare decision support for patients.

AB Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent neurological disorder that necessitates using objective and non-invasive methods for assessing symptom severity. Traditional visual assessments are often limited by subjectivity, while other wearable sensors or visual markers may result in unnatural movements. This study presents a novel contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment that integrates refined whole-body pose esti-mation with Transformer-based tremor detection to quantify tremor severity at a fine-grained level. The proposed pose estimation method combines the Transformer with HRNet, effectively capturing spatial-temporal complementary information from multiple body parts and enabling highly accurate tremor detection. The Transformer-based tremor detection is well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies and sequential tremor data extracted by the pose estimation model, further improving the performance of our proposed method. Our study collected data from 61 patients with ET, achieving an average accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 95.6%/95.6%, 89.2%/95.0%, and 83.0%/92.4% for classifying ET severity both during rest and postural tasks, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms the temporal convolutional network baseline, increasing F1 scores by 21.17% and 14.22% for rest and postural tasks, respectively. This high level of accuracy makes our method highly useful for clinical applications such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation. Our proposed technique has many advantages over traditional ET assessment techniques, including non-invasiveness, contact-free operation, and not requiring any wearable sensors or visual markers. Moreover, our method can be applied to other movement disorders requiring objective measurements of symptom severity. In summary, our contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment represents a significant improvement over traditional ET assessment techniques, and our quantification results demonstrate its potential for use in clinical settings.

   temporal dependencies; Adaptive cross-spacetime relationships
ID GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK
AB Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted more and more attention due to its advantage in avoiding environmental noise including light transformations and viewpoint changing. Most current approaches consist of interleaving spatial-only modules and temporal-only modules, where messages are first spatially aggregated between human joints and then temporally delivered. Although efficient, such factorized design hinders direct information flow among joints in adjacent frames, thus failing to (1) effectively convey information in a larger neighborhood and (2) be inferior to capture short-term motion to distinguish similar action pairs. To handle these limitations, we propose spatial-temporal graph attention network (STGAT) to dynamically model local cross-spacetime information. Keeping the temporal-only modules unchanged, it inflates the spatial only modules to perform spatial-temporal modeling from the local spatial-temporal neighborhood without a second transmission cost. Especially, different from previous spatial-temporal modeling methods, graph edges are adaptively computed to dynamically aggregate beneficial information to capture short-term movements, getting rid of predefined fixed connectivity. This ensures STGAT could dynamically attend to important joints in a local spatial-temporal neighborhood to capture critical short-term movements. While STGAT is theoretically effective in introducing local spatial-temporal information by comprising a large spatial-temporal neighborhood, we find its effectiveness is impeded by the inherent redundancy in local features. We propose three simple modules to reduce local feature redundancy to calibrate the feature modeling schema and further release the potential of STGAT, which (1) narrow the scope of self-attention operators, (2) dynamically weight joints along the temporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features, respectively. As a result, STGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400. Thanks to special care on local cross-spacetime information, STGAT generalizes better upon classifying hard similar actions than previous methods. Visualizations demonstrate that STGAT could intelligently attend to critical joints when dealing with different actions. Code is available at https://github.com/hulianyuyy/STGAT.

AB In the realm of stability analysis for fractional neutral neural networks, it is not uncommon to encounter erroneous Lyapunov functions. To investigate the stability of fractional memristor-based neural networks with neutral delays and reaction-diffusion (FNRDMNNs), this study presents a novel modified Lyapunov- Krasovskii functions. By invoking Green's theorem and employing inequality techniques, we derive two nonconservative criteria and a corollary through the design of two enhanced pinning controllers, ensuring the stability of FNRDMNNs. Furthermore, the contributions of this paper not only serve as refinements to existing findings but also hold broader applicability for advancing the theoretical analysis of fractional neutral-type systems. To corroborate the obtained results, we perform a series of simulations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In real applications, one object (e.g., image) can be described by multiple instances (e.g., image patches) and simultaneously associated with multiple labels. Such applications can be formulated as multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML) problems and have been extensively studied currently. Existing MIML methods are useful in many applications but most of which suffer from relatively low accuracy and training efficiency due to: i) the inter-label correlations are neglected; ii) the inter-instance correlations cannot be learned directly with other types of correlations due to the missing instance labels; iii) diverse inter-correlations (e.g., inter-label correlations, inter-instance correlations) can only be learned in multiple stages. To resolve these issues, a new single-stage framework called broad multi-instance multi-label learning (BMIML) is proposed. In BMIML, there are three innovative modules: i) auto-weighted label enhancement learning (AWLEL) based on broad learning system (BLS) is designed, which simultaneously captures the inter-label correlations while traditional BLS cannot; ii) A specific MIML neural network, scalable multi-instance probabilistic regression (SMIPR) is constructed to effectively estimate the inter-instance correlations, which can provide additional probabilistic information for learning; iii) Finally, an interactive decision optimization (IDO) is designed to combine and optimize the results from AWLEL and SMIPR and form a single-stage framework. Consequently, BMIML can achieve simultaneous learning of diverse inter-correlations between whole images, instances, and labels in single stage for higher classification accuracy and much faster training time. Experiments show that BMIML is highly competitive to (or even better than) existing methods in accuracy and much faster.

AB The brain's mystery for efficient and intelligent computation hides in the neuronal encoding, functional circuits, and plasticity principles in natural neural networks. However, many plasticity principles have not been fully incorporated into artificial or spiking neural networks (SNNs). Here, we report that incorporating a novel feature of synaptic plasticity found in natural networks, whereby synaptic modifications self-propagate to nearby synapses, named self-lateral propagation (SLP), could further improve the accuracy of SNNs in three benchmark spatial and temporal classification tasks. The SLP contains lateral pre (SLPpre) and lateral post (SLPpost) synaptic propagation, describing the spread of synaptic modifications among output synapses made by axon collaterals or among converging synapses on the postsynaptic neuron, respectively. The SLP is biologically plausible and can lead to a coordinated synaptic modification within layers that endow higher efficiency without losing much accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental results showed the impressive role of SLP in sharpening the normal distribution of synaptic weights and broadening the more uniform distribution of misclassified samples, which are both considered essential for understanding the learning convergence and network generalization of neural networks.

TI Estimation of Abnormal Cell Growth and MCG-Based Discriminative Feature
   Analysis of Histopathological Breast Images
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID TUMOR-GROWTH
AB The accurate prediction of cancer from microscopic biopsy images has always been a major challenge for medical practitioners and pathologists who manually observe the shape and structure of the cells from tissues under a microscope. Mathematical modelling of cell proliferation helps to predict tumour sizes and optimizes the treatment procedure. This paper introduces a cell growth estimation function that uncovers the growth behaviour of benign and malignant cells. To analyse the cellular level information from tissue images, we propose a minimized cellular graph (MCG) development method. The method extracts cells and produces different features that are useful in classifying benign and malignant tissues. The method's graphical features enable a precise and timely exploration of huge amounts of data and can help in making predictions and informed decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm for constructing a minimized cellular graph which reduces the computational complexity. A comparative study is performed based on the state-of-the-art classifiers, SVM, decision tree, random forest, nearest neighbor, LDA, Naive Bayes, and ANN. The experimental data are obtained from the BreakHis dataset, which contains 2480 benign and 5429 malignant histopathological images. The proposed technique achieves a 97.7% classification accuracy which is 7% higher than that of the other graph feature-based classification methods. A comparative study reveals a performance improvement for breast cancer classification compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

ID SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AB This paper focuses on text-based affective computing for Jopara, a code-switching language that combines Guarani and Spanish. First, we collected a dataset of tweets primarily written in Guarani and annotated them for three widely used dimensions in sentiment analysis: (a) emotion recognition, (b) humor detection, and (c) offensive language identification. Then, we developed several neural network models, including large language models specifically designed for Guarani, and compared their performance against off-the-shelf multilingual and Spanish pre-trained models for the aforementioned dimensions. Our experiments show that language models incorporating Guarani during pre-training or pre-fine-tuning consistently achieve the best results, despite limited resources (a single 24-GB GPU and only 800K tokens). Notably, even a Guarani BERT model with just two layers of Transformers shows a favorable balance between accuracy and computational power, likely due to the inherent low-resource nature of the task. We present a comprehensive overview of corpus creation and model development for low-resource languages like Guarani, particularly in the context of its code-switching with Spanish, resulting in Jopara. Our findings shed light on the challenges and strategies involved in analyzing affective language in such linguistic contexts.

AB Complex data analysis should be done in the most accurate way in order to express the uncertain environments in the most ideal way. In addition, mathematical models that can best express the membership degrees that represent the objects are preferred for these data analyses. Taking these situations into account, this study proposes the concept of single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy soft set, which can be expressed with four different membership degrees of each object that provides a parameter, with the contribution of the parameterisation tool. Some important results are obtained by examining some single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy soft set-based theoretical operations. In addition, distance measures between two single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy soft sets. Then, similarity measurements based on these distance measurements are studied. In this way, a determination has been made for the analysis of the decision-making processes for the determination of the interaction between two single-valued neutrosophic fuzzy soft sets.

AB An ever increasing number of electronic devices integrated into the Internet of Things (IoT) generates vast amounts of data, which gets transported via network and stored for further analysis. However, besides the undisputed advantages of this technology, it also brings risks of unauthorized access and data compromise, situations where machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help with detection of potential threats, intrusions and automation of the diagnostic process. The effectiveness of the applied algorithms largely depends on the previously performed optimization, i.e., predetermined values of hyperparameters and training conducted to achieve the desired result. Therefore, to address very important issue of IoT security, this article proposes an AI framework based on the simple convolutional neural network (CNN) and extreme machine learning machine (ELM) tuned by modified sine cosine algorithm (SCA). Not withstanding that many methods for addressing security issues have been developed, there is always a possibility for further improvements and proposed research tried to fill in this gap. The introduced framework was evaluated on two ToN IoT intrusion detection datasets, that consist of the network traffic data generated in Windows 7 and Windows 10 environments. The analysis of the results suggests that the proposed model achieved superior level of classification performance for the observed datasets. Additionally, besides conducting rigid statistical tests, best derived model is interpreted by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and results findings can be used by security experts to further enhance security of IoT systems.

AB With rising pollution concerns in recent times, producing refined and accurate predictions as a part of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 13 (climate action) have gained utmost importance. As new model architectures become available, it becomes difficult for an average policymaker to evaluate various models comprehensively. One such architecture is the transformer neural network which has shown an exceptional rise in various areas such as natural language processing and computer vision. This paper explores the performance of such a transformer-based neural network (referred in the paper as PolTrans) in the domain of pollution forecasting. Experiments based on four univariate city pollution datasets (Delhi, Seoul, Skopje and Ulaanbaatar) and two multivariate datasets (Beijing PM2.5 and Beijing PM10 are performed against baselines consisting of widely used statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods. Findings show that although PolTrans performs comparatively better compared to existing deep learning methods such as bidirectional long short-term memory networks (LSTM), LSTM autoencoder, etc., for modelling pollution in cities such as Beijing, Delhi and Ulaanbaatar, in the majority of cases, the PolTrans architecture lags behind statistical and machine learning methods such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), random forest regression, standard vector regression (SVR), etc., by a range of 1.5-15 units in terms of root mean square error.

ID CLOUDLETS
AB Owing to the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile devices, big data has been generated, and a cloud computing system is required to manipulate it. The main issue in this system is the access delay (AD) when the IoT and mobile devices offload their workload on the servers and the workload balance among them. Mobile edge computing (MEC), which has a sufficient distribution of edge servers (ESs) and resources, has been developed to overcome this problem. The placement of ESs in MEC is an NP-hard problem and a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem that aims to reduce the AD between mobile users and ES and balance the workload among these servers. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid natural-inspired algorithm by combining the manta ray foraging algorithm and the uniform crossover operator to find the optimal edge server placement (ESP) in MEC and minimize the AD between mobile users and the ES. Although the standard manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) algorithm can balance diversification and intensification, it suffers from premature convergence. We invoke a uniform crossover operator in the standard MRFO algorithm to overcome this problem. In addition, the standard MRFO algorithm is designed to solve continuous optimization problems and is unsuitable for solving discrete problems. However, ESP is a discrete optimization problem. We modified the operators in the standard MRFO algorithm to solve the ESP problem, achieving an optimal solution in terms of minimizing the AD between BSs and ESs and balancing the workload among ESs. The proposed algorithm is then tested on the Shanghai Telecom dataset and compared with five other algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the least AD, and the workload balance reaches about 52% compared with the other algorithms.

AB Due to the expansion of privacy protection, and data sharing gets complicated and is known to be a hot issue in the research areas. Many business scenarios in the supply chain network have been highly important in research areas. Especially, blockchain technology ensures the essential solution in the supply chain network for securing information sharing. Yet, it is difficult to maintain security at every blockchain level, whereas it is suggested to use "public-private key cryptography." The fundamental goal of this research work is to present new privacy preservation of data using hybrid meta-heuristic algorithms with blockchain technology. The secured supply chain network is built with blockchain technology. The privacy preservation of data sharing in blockchain technology is handled by the electric fish-Harris hawks optimization (EF-HHO). This new algorithm is utilized for the key generation phase of two processes like "data sanitization and restoration." The optimal key generation follows a multi-objective problem is solved by the variables like "Hiding Failure (HF) rate, information preservation (IP) rate, and false rule (FR) generation, and degree of modification (DM)". The result analysis shows the offered model provides effective performance when compared with existing conventional techniques.

AB In financial network models, to assess systemic risk, a general understanding and prediction of precisely how a single financial institution is associated with systemic risk from the network perspective remains lacking. This paper proposes a framework for predicting and assessing system crises through inferring the cause-effect relationships between financial institutions and system state, which is structured in three steps: the assessment stage for system state based on the mean-variance framework, the prediction stage based on a Bayesian network and the reliability stage based on the Markov process. By applying them to monthly returns of financial institutions, it implies the need to pay attention to insurance and Broker sectors while regulating the banking system on the Bayesian network theory. Moreover, we find that the measure contains predictive power both during tranquil periods and during financial crisis periods. The results can be applied to derive interventions in financial crisis management with regard to systemic risk prediction and system state reliability.

AB Personalized individual semantics (PIS) is an important factor reflecting the personal habits of decision makers (DMs) and has been widely studied by scholars. Using criteria as a non-negligible information source in multi-criteria group decision making (MCGDM), how to extract PIS from it is a research gap to be solved. In addition, existing measurements of consensus are insufficiently sensitive to differences between individuals, while the current direction rules use a matrix as the unit of measurement, which is not detailed and precise enough. Therefore, this paper first constructs a PIS extraction model according to the principle that similar criteria have similar descriptions and mutually exclusive criteria have dissimilar descriptions. Secondly, the preference information of PIS is mingled with uncertainty and reliability of improved basic uncertain linguistic information (IBULI) as the data of the consensus reaching algorithm. The proposed consensus algorithm not only fully considers the dispersion of DMs in the consensus measurement stage, but also improves the objectivity of the consensus process through an adaptive feedback stage. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified by an example and comparative analysis of the selection of sustainable building materials.

AB Accurate tumor segmentation in medical images plays an important role in clinical diagnosis and disease analysis. However, medical images usually have great complexity, such as low contrast of computed tomography (CT) or low spatial resolution of positron emission tomography (PET). In the actual radiotherapy plan, multimodal imaging technology, such as PET/CT, is often used. PET images provide basic metabolic information and CT images provide anatomical details. In this paper, we propose a 3D PET/CT tumor co-segmentation framework based on active contour model. First, a new edge stop function (ESF) based on PET image and CT image is defined, which combines the grayscale standard deviation information of the image and is more effective for blurry medical image edges. Second, we propose a background subtraction model to solve the problem of uneven grayscale level in medical images. Apart from that, the calculation format adopts the level set algorithm based on the additive operator splitting (AOS) format. The solution is unconditionally stable and eliminates the dependence on time step size. Experimental results on a dataset of 50 pairs of PET/CT images of non-small cell lung cancer patients show that the proposed method has a good performance for tumor segmentation.

AB Enterprise software requires constant updates to keep it usable. These updates originate in correcting errors and mainly in new organizational demands. Over time, these demands generate a significant workload that becomes increasingly complex than the first requirements. For this reason, the organization providing the software may choose to continue updating the old product or make it obsolete and replace it with a new one. Identifying the ideal moment to carry out this migration involves, in addition to the costs of keeping the product obsolete for a while, the effort to develop a new one. This work addresses a case study that comprises fifteen years with two migrations of the software project. Due to the availability of the collection of activities performed by the development and support team, performed sequentially over time, the applicability of time series was possible. Furthermore, the historical base of the activities performed made it possible to use the time series decomposition to obtain its trend, seasonality and noise. Time series decomposition indicated many random events in the first migration, while in the second, the team self-regulated, but there were tension points. This study identified a preliminary model whose purpose is to determine when to develop a new software version.

AB Exploratory factor analysis is a widely used framework in the social and behavioral sciences. Since measurement errors are always present in human behavior data, latent factors, generating the observed data, are important to identify. While most factor analysis methods rely on linear relationships in the data-generating process, deep learning models can provide more flexible modeling approaches. However, two problems need to be addressed. First, for interpretation, scaling assumptions are required, which can be (at least) cumbersome for deep generative models. Second, deep generative models are typically not identifiable, which is required in order to identify the underlying latent constructs. We developed a model that uses a variational autoencoder as an estimator for a complex factor analysis model based on importance-weighted variational inference. In order to receive interpretable results and an identified model, we use a linear factor model with identification constraints in the measurement model. To maintain the flexibility of the model, we use normalizing flow latent priors. Within the evaluation of performance measures in a talent development program in soccer, we found more clarity in the separation of the identified underlying latent dimensions with our models compared to traditional PCA analyses.

AB Deep learning-based epileptic seizure recognition via electroencephalogram signals has shown considerable potential for clinical practice. Although deep learning algorithms can enhance epilepsy identification accuracy compared with classical machine learning techniques, classifying epileptic activities based on the association between multichannel signals in electroencephalogram recordings is still challenging in automated seizure classification from electroencephalogram signals. Furthermore, the performance of generalization is hardly maintained by the fact that existing deep learning models were constructed using just one architecture. This study focuses on addressing this challenge using a hybrid framework. Alternatively put, a hybrid deep learning model, which is based on the ground-breaking graph neural network and transformer architectures, was proposed. The proposed deep architecture consists of a graph model to discover the inner relationship between multichannel signals and a transformer to reveal the heterogeneous associations between the channels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the comparison experiments were conducted on a publicly available dataset between the state-of-the-art algorithms and ours. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is a potentially valuable instrument for epoch-based epileptic EEG classification.

AB Cursive handwriting recognition (CHWR) is an interesting area of research as it has a wide range of applications but lacks an accurate approach to provide better results due to its character shapes, the non-uniform spacing between words and within a word, diverse placements of dots, and diacritics, and very low inter-class variation among individual classes. A novel CHWR model is proposed to enhance the recognition accuracy with high global stability. The proposed model introduces three major phases: pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. In the pre-processing stage, the noise removal and binarization are adapted with the intrusion of improved adaptive wiener filtering (IAWF) and structural symmetric pixels. A hybrid deep direction distribution feature extraction (HDDDFE) approach is proposed to extract directional Local gradient histogram (LGH), column gradient histogram (CGH) features and a wavelet convolutional neural network with Block Attention Module (WCNN-BAM) is proposed to extract deep global features (GF), profile features (PF) and dynamic features (DF). A novel double hidden layer gated recurrent neural network with a feature attention mechanism (ODHL-GRNN-FAM) is proposed to offer handwritten classification results. The developed model is evaluated with the IAM database and attains an overall recognition accuracy of 98%, precision of 97%, f-measure of 97.99%, character error rate (CER) of 1.23%, word error rate (WER) of 4.8%, respectively.

AB Physical reservoir computing is a framework that enables energy-efficient information processing by using physical systems. Nonlinear dynamics in physical systems provide a computational capability that is unique to reservoirs. It is, however, difficult to find an appropriate task for a reservoir because of the complexity of nonlinear information processing. The information processing capacity has recently been used to clarify systematically the tasks that are solved by reservoirs; it quantifies the memory capacity of reservoirs in accordance with the order of nonlinearity. Herein, an experimental evaluation of the information processing capacity of a spintronic oscillator consisting of nanostructured ferromagnets is reported. The spintronic reservoir state is electrically manipulated by adding a delayed-feedback circuit. The total capacity reaches a maximum of 5.6 at the edge of the echo state property. A trade-off between the linear and nonlinear components of the capacity is also found. The result can be used to better understand the nonlinear information processing in reservoirs and to find good matches between reservoirs and tasks. As an example, a function-approximation task is performed and it is found that it can be efficiently solved when the reservoir state is appropriately tuned so that its information processing capacity matches that of the task.

DE Explainability; Reinforcement learning; Causal; Temporal importance
AB Explainability plays an increasingly important role in machine learning. Because reinforcement learning (RL) involves interactions between states and actions over time, it's more challenging to explain an RL policy than supervised learning. Furthermore, humans view the world through a causal lens and thus prefer causal explanations over associational ones. Therefore, in this paper, we develop a causal explanation mechanism that quantifies the causal importance of states on actions and such importance over time. We also demonstrate the advantages of our mechanism over state-of-the-art associational methods in terms of RL policy explanation through a series of simulation studies, including crop irrigation, Blackjack, collision avoidance, and lunar lander.

AB Crowd counting is a task to estimate the total number of pedestrians in an image. In most of the existing research, good vision problems, such as in parks, squares, and bright shopping malls during the day, have been addressed. However, there is little research on complex scenes in darkness. To study this problem, we propose an interactive network based on Transformer for multi-modal crowd counting. First, sliding convolutional encoding is adopted for the image to obtain better encoding features. The features are extracted through the designed primary interaction network, and then channel token attention is used to modulate the features. Then, the FGAF-MLP is used for high and low semantic fusion to enhance the feature expression and fully fuse the data in different modes to improve the accuracy of the method. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive ablation experiments with the latest multimodal benchmark RGBT-CC, and we verified the complementarity between multiple modal data and the effectiveness of the model components. We also verified the effectiveness of our method with the ShanghaiTechRGBD benchmark. The experimental results showed that our proposed method exhibits good results and achieves an improvement of more than 10% in terms of the mean average error and mean squared error for the RGBT-CC benchmark.

ID VISUAL-ATTENTION; PREDICTION
AB Since the audio information is fully explored and leveraged in omnidirectional videos (ODVs), the performance of existing audio-visual saliency models has been improving dramatically and significantly. However, these models are still in their infancy stages, and there are two significant issues in modeling human attention between visual and auditory modalities: (1) Temporal non-alignment problem between auditory and visual modalities is rarely considered; (2) Most audio-visual saliency models are audio content attributes-agnostic. Thus, they need to learn audio features with fine details. This paper proposes a novel audio-visual aligned saliency (AVAS) model that can simultaneously tackle two issues as mentioned above in an effective end-to-end training manner. In order to solve the temporal non-alignment problem between the two modalities, a Hanning window method is employed on the audio stream to truncate the audio signal per unit time (frame-time interval) to match the visual information stream of the corresponding duration, which can capture the potential correlation of two modalities across time steps and facilitate audio-visual features fusion. Regarding the audio content attribute-agnostic issue, an effective periodic audio encoding method is proposed based on implicit neural representation (INR) to map audio sampling points to their corresponding audio frequency values, which can better discriminate and interpret audio content attributes. Comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation analyses are performed on the benchmark dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model consistently outperforms other competitors by a large margin.

ID SERVICE PLACEMENT; EDGE
AB Mobile edge computing provides a low-latency, high-bandwidth cloud computing environment for resource-constrained mobile devices by allowing mobile devices to offload tasks, but user task migration causes greater transmission delays. Cloudlets, a new component of mobile edge computing, can perform tasks offloaded by mobile users nearby to reduce the access latency and meet users' requirements for system response time. However, deploying cloudlets in large-scale wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) to improve the service quality of mobile applications is currently still difficult. To resolve this issue, we design a cloudlet deployment model based on approximate graph cut, which abstracts the wireless communication network into an undirected weighted graph, divides the graph according to the access point location attributes, and minimizes the user access delay of subgraphs to obtain optimal network area segmentation and cloudlet deployment locations. We also develop an efficient kernel method to optimize the objective function of graph cuts. The simulation experimental results demonstrate that our model has low time and space complexity; thus, it is suitable for large-scale cloudlet deployment and has valuable application prospects.

AB We have derived conditions when unintended feedback loops occur in supervised machine learning systems. In this paper, we study an important problem of discovering and measuring hidden feedback loops. Such feedback loops occur in web search, recommender systems, healthcare, predictive public policing and other systems. As a possible cause of echo chambers and filter bubbles, these feedback loops tend to produce concept drifts in user behavior. We study systems in their context of use, because both learning algorithms and user interactions are important. Then we decompose the automation bias from the use of the system into users adherence to predictions and their usage rate to derive conditions for a feedback loop to occur. We also provide estimates for the size of a concept drift caused by the loop. A series of controlled simulation experiments with real-world and synthetic data support our findings. This paper builds on our prior results and elaborates the analytical model of feedback loops, extends the experiments, and provides practical application guidelines.

DE Universal model adaptation; Unsupervised domain adaptation; Style
   augmentation; Consistency regularization
AB Learning to recognize unknown target samples is of great importance for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) and open-partial domain adaptation (OPDA) are two typical UDA scenarios, and the latter assumes that some source-private categories exist. However, most existing approaches are devised for one UDA scenario and often have bad performance on the other. Furthermore, they also demand access to source data during adaptation, leading them highly impractical due to data privacy concerns. To address the above issues, we propose a novel universal model framework that can handle both UDA scenarios without prior knowledge of the source-target label-set relationship nor access to source data. For source training, we learn a source model with both closed-set and open-set classifiers and provide it to the target domain. For target adaptation, we propose a novel Style Augmented Open-set Consistency (SAOC) objective to minimize the impact of target domain style on model behavior. Specifically, we exploit the proposed Intra-Domain Style Augmentation (IDSA) strategy to generate style-augmented target images. Then we enforce the consistency of the open-set classifier's prediction between the image and its corresponding style-augmented version. Extensive experiments on OSDA and OPDA scenarios demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits comparable or superior performance to some recent source-dependent approaches.

AB Quick response (QR) code-based traceability is considered as a smart solution to know details about the origin of products, from production to transportation and preservation before reaching customers. However, the QR code is easily copied and forged. Thus, we propose a new approach to protect this code from tampering. The approach consists of two main phases like hiding a security feature in the QR code, and estimating the similarity between the QR code affixed on the product and the genuine ones. For the former issue, the secret feature is encoded and decoded by using error correcting code for controlling errors in noisy communication channels. Hiding and extracting the encoded information in the QR code are conducted by utilizing a deep neural network in which the proposed network produces a watermarked QR code image with good quality and high tolerance to noises. The network is capable of robustness against real distortions caused by the process of printing and photograph. For the later issue, we develop neural networks based upon the architecture of Siamese network to measure the similarity of QR codes. The secret feature extracted from the obtained QR code and the result of QR code similarity estimation are combined to determine whether a QR code is genuine or fake. The proposed approach gives a competitive performance, with an average accuracy of 98%, and it has been applied to QR code authentication in practice.

AB Mining frequent Time Intervals-Related Patterns (TIRPs) from series of symbolic time intervals offers a comprehensive framework for heterogeneous, multivariate temporal data analysis in various application domains. While gaining a growing interest in recent decades, the efficient mining of frequent TIRPs is still a high computational challenge which has also not yet been investigated in its full complexity. The majority of previous methods discover only the first instances of the TIRPs within each series of symbolic time intervals, whereas their re-occurring instances are ignored. This eventually results in an incomplete discovery of frequent TIRPs, a problem that lies also in the challenge of mining only the frequent closed TIRPs, which was only recently investigated for the first time. In this paper, we introduce TIRPClo-an efficient algorithm for the complete mining of either the entire set of frequent TIRPs, or only the frequent closed TIRPs. The algorithm proposes a non-ambiguous sequential representation of symbolic time intervals series through the intervals' end-points, as well as a memory-efficient index and a novel method for data projection, due to which it is the first algorithm to guarantee a complete discovery of frequent closed TIRPs. The experimental evaluation conducted on eleven real-world and four synthetic datasets demonstrates that TIRPClo is up to 10 times faster when mining the entire set of frequent TIRPs, and up to more than 100 times faster when mining only the frequent closed TIRPs compared to four state-of-the-art methods, while also reporting lower memory measurements.

AB We consider a real-world scenario in which a newly-established pilot project needs to make inferences for newly-collected data with the help of other parties under privacy protection policies. Current federated learning (FL) paradigms are devoted to solving the data heterogeneity problem without considering the to-be-inferred data. We propose a novel learning paradigm named transductive federated learning to simultaneously consider the structural information of the to-be-inferred data. On the one hand, the server could use the pre-available test samples to refine the aggregated models for robust model fusion, which tackles the data heterogeneity problem in FL. On the other hand, the refinery process incorporates test samples into training and could generate better predictions in a transductive manner. We propose several techniques including stabilized teachers, rectified distillation, and clustered label refinery to facilitate the model refinery process. Abundant experimental studies verify the superiorities of the proposed Model refinery framework for Transductive Federated learning. The source code is available at https://github.com/lxcnju/MrTF.

AB The relative success of learning to rank algorithms has raised the attention of the research community for developing efficient and effective ranking methods. Proposed ranking algorithms are usually evaluated using available benchmark datasets. However, these datasets are of different characteristics and their usage in the evaluation of learning to rank algorithms may yield completely different experimental results. Consequently, having an appropriate understanding of the specifications of benchmark datasets would be beneficial both in the analysis of experimental results as well as in the development of new benchmark datasets. In this regard, the current research proposes a graph-based framework for comparative analysis of learning to rank datasets. For a given dataset, a feature-similarity graph is produced in which nodes represent features of the corresponding dataset, and weights of edges indicate Kendall's Tau similarity values of connected pairs of features. Thereafter, a variety of structural and node-based attributes are extracted either from the produced feature-similarity graph or its giant component. This method is applied to four learning to rank datasets: MSLR-Web10K, Istella, WCL2R, and dotIR, where the last one is the only available Persian learning to rank dataset. Based on the experimentations, WCL2R is completely different from the other evaluated datasets in the structural and node-based properties. Among the three remaining datasets, MSLR-Web10, Istella, and dotIR, the last two are more similar to each other.

AB Digital transformation is driving the current technological trends in manufacturing. An integral constituent is a communication between machines, between machines and humans, or between machines and products. This extensive communication involves large volumes of data. Many manufacturers apply data analytics (e.g., for quality management or improvement purposes) to translate the data into a business value. However, isolated, rigid, and area-specific IT solutions often carry this out. Today's complex manufacturing requires quality management approaches that constitute a holistic view of and understanding of process-product interactions along the process chain instead of focusing solely on single processes. A novel platform approach to support quality management in manufacturing systems is proposed in this paper to overcome this deficit. It integrates state-of-the-art concepts of IT with modeling approaches for planning and operation of quality management. A conceptual framework and the technical architecture for implementing a digitalization platform are presented in this regard. Moreover, the approach is validated and implemented within a web application based on a use case of data-driven quality management in electronics production.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) technology serves many industries to improve their performance. As such, utilizing far distant cloud datacenters to run time-sensitive IoT applications has become a great challenge for the sake of real-time interaction and accurate service delivery time requests. Therefore, the fog computing as a deployment approach of IoT applications has been presented in the edge network. However, inefficient deployment of applications' modules on the fog infrastructure leads to physical resource and bandwidth dissipations, and debilitation of quality of service (QoS), and also increases the power consumption. When all application's modules are highly utilized on a single fog node owing to the reduction in the power consumption, the level of service reliability is decreased. To obviate the problem, this paper takes the concept of fault tolerance threshold into account as a criterion to guarantee applications' running reliability. This paper formulates deployment of IoT applications' modules on fog infrastructure as a multi-objective optimization problem with minimizing both bandwidth wastage and power consumption approach. To solve this combinatorial problem, a multi-objective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA) is proposed which considers physical resource utilization and bandwidth wastage rate in their objective functions along with reliability and application's QoS in their constraints. To validate the proposed method, extensive scenarios have been conducted. The result of simulations proves that the proposed MOGA model has 18, 38, 9, and 43 percent of improvement against MODCS, MOGWO-I, MOGWO-II, and MOPSO in terms of total power consumption (TPC) and it has 6.4, 15.99, 28.15, and 15.43 dominance percent against them in term of link wastage rate (LWR), respectively.

AB Energy consumption is getting rising gradually around the planet. Therefore, the importance of energy management has increased for all nations worldwide, and long-term energy demand estimation is becoming a vital problem for all countries. In this study, linear, quadratic and exponential models based six different Archimedes optimization algorithms (AOA) such as AOA-Linear, AOA-Quadratic, AOA-Exponential, IAOA-Linear, IAOA-Quadratic and IAOA-Exponential have been proposed to make some future projections of Turkey for the years (2021-2050). The previous studies in the literature were used the data set of Turkey, such as observed energy demand (OED), population, gross domestic product (GDP), export and import data for the years (1979-2005) or (1979-2011) obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR). However, in this study, a new data set is organized with the OED, population, GDP, export and import data of Turkey for the years (1997-2020) to make some long-term energy demand estimations of Turkey, and this dataset is used for the first time in this study. AOA-Linear, AOA-Quadratic and AOA-Exponential algorithms are based on linear, quadratic and exponential mathematical models and the basic AOA method. IAOA-Linear, IAOA-Quadratic and IAOA-Exponential algorithms are also based on linear, quadratic and exponential mathematical models and the improved AOA (For short, IAOA) proposed in this study. Once a sensitivity analysis is made for determining the effect of algorithmic parameters of AOA and IAOA, the proposed algorithms are realized for Turkey's long-term energy demand estimation for the years (2021-2050) with three different future scenarios. According to the experimental results, the quadratic model-based proposed IAOA produces better or comparable performance on the problem dealt with in this study in terms of solution quality and robustness.

AB These days, digital art has substantially improved painting art in China's new media period through modern technology and specialized software, which has generated various digital artworks with painting effects, demonstrating their aesthetic, commercial, and cultural worth. As a result, designers must actively investigate intelligently linked and content-diverse techniques to innovate and improve digital media art. This investigation will allow the extraction of pivotal role of digital media communication and drives visual art to new heights in the modern digitized era. Based on this motivation, this paper tries to analyze the application of new media digital technology in painting creation using big data. The major goal is to obtain insights into artists' behavior using behavioral habits and a morphological algorithm in digital painting. The study investigates the design process of digital painting by analyzing the habitual forms displayed by diverse painting user groups and integrating them with user experience design concepts. Two experimental methodologies are used to investigate painting user behavior: the interview method and the observation method. The observation approach collects comprehensive user behavior data to develop a habit form model that includes a both virtual and real activity. This model employs a hierarchical scheme emphasizing various behavior aspects and concepts throughout user interactions and painting system operations. The interview method, on the other hand, captures the psychological activities involved in user behavior decision-making. The study discovers and decomposes the traits specific to these characters by defining painted characters, developing their behavior sets, and making interactive decisions. The learned information and experience are then applied in interactive decision-making processes. Based on these findings, prototype development includes explicit and implicit interaction prototypes, with usability tests determining whether specific roles are included in the design. Throughout the study process, fuzzy mapping associations are built, and behavior mappings are labeled with varying relationship proportions, providing critical data for the habit form model's construction. The paper uses new digital media technology to create paintings and experiments with 50 randomly selected persons. Forty-four participants are well-known authors on major painting websites, with the remaining six being interviewed as professional painters.

ID EVOLUTES
AB The involute-evolute pair is a classic theme, which has great research significance in mathematics and engineering. A Cartan null curve is a curve whose tangent vector is light-like on each point, and its module vanishes everywhere along the curve. Due to these special properties of null curves, some research on them shows more particular and interesting prospects. In this paper, the involutes of null Cartan curves are defined and investigated based on the classifications of curves in Minkowski space. The conclusion that the involutes of null Cartan curves only can be space-like is achieved, and the relationships on curvatures, torsions, frames, expressions between a null Cartan curve and its three kinds of space-like involutes are explored. Especially, the pseudo-null involute of a given null Cartan curve can be directly expressed via the structure function of the null curve; the first and second kind space-like involutes of a given null Cartan curve can also be expressed if the tangent distance function is determined. Meanwhile, the k-type null helices and their involutes are expressed by the structure functions of null curves. Last but not least, some typical examples are presented and visualized to characterize such curve pairs explicitly.

ID NETWORK
AB Since artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, one of swarm intelligent algorithms, was proposed, it has shown good superiority in addressing optimization problems, and has attracted widespread attention because of its simple structure and good global optimization ability. However, ABC still has the shortcomings of slower convergence and poorer exploitation for complex practical problems. To overcome these limitations, an enhanced algorithm of multi-strategy collaboration based on neighborhood search called EMABC-NS is proposed. Firstly, the information of global optimal individual in the current population and individuals in the neighborhood are employed to the search phase of employed bees and onlooker bees, respectively. Secondly, the modification rate MR is introduced to randomly perturb all dimensions of the solutions. Finally, the search strategy of scout bees is enhanced by integrating current optimal solution and stochastic solution through MR. 23 well-established benchmark functions and 5 engineering optimization problems are utilized to validate the performance of EMABC-NS. The experimental result reveals that EMABC-NS is more competitiveness compared with other outstanding competitors, and it ranks first in the Friedman test. Compared with the other five algorithms, the proposed algorithm is also proved to be effective in solving practical engineering problems.

AB The purpose of this study is to use multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and extreme learning machine (ELM) artificial intelligence models to estimate the compressive strength of the circular concrete columns wrapped with FRP sheets. In addition, to improve the accuracy of these models, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used in combination with these models, and the accuracy of the models was evaluated to estimate the strength values. The results indicate that in general, the artificial intelligence models estimate the compressive strength of FRP-wrapped columns more accurately than the existing analytical models. In particular, the combined MARS-PSO model offered a better performance compared to the other models, as this model has correlation coefficients of 0.9972 and 0.9961 in the training and testing phases, respectively. Moreover, a combination of the PSO algorithm with the two models, MARS and ELM, improved their accuracy by 6.13 and 4.68%, respectively.

AB With the rapid development of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile technology, smart devices and their diversified business applications are booming, and mobile data traffic is soaring. The new Internet applications provide people with a rich information experience, while also bringing new challenges to the existing communication system. This paper proposes a 3DCLS model based on visual information, which uses convolutional neural networks and recurrent convolutional neural networks with long-term and short-term memory to create spatiotemporal information for visual emotion recognition tasks. In-depth analysis of the embedded software's speech recognition workflow and testing methods discussed the speech recognition system. After the test records, a set of criteria for evaluating the recognition characteristics of embedded speech recognition systems was proposed. Based on the various usage scenarios of embedded speech recognition and their impact, a test case template covering actual use cases was produced. Many major achievements have been made in the status of the Japanese major in the world. The number of Japanese majors, masters, and doctorates has increased rapidly, and teaching methods have been continuously improved. With the implementation of the national education consulting policy, the teaching content is constantly updated, and the teaching staff and scientific research work have also achieved fruitful results. However, there are still many areas that need improvement in teaching, textbook research, and teaching reform. Checking the status quo of basic training, increasing the intensity of cross-cultural communication training, and accelerating the construction of a Japanese training system with Chinese characteristics are important tasks for some time to come.

AB As an evolving technology, computer image processing technology originated in 1980. With the development of this technology, aiming at the defects of professional image processing in the current image processing software, this paper designs and develops a new type of image processing software platform computer system, and optimizes the processing image in the software platform. In addition, this article also optimizes the imaging software architecture design, imaging software platform and imaging plug-in interface design to manage the components and plug-ins of the imaging software platform. With the continuous development of computer technology, the number of users is also increasing, and the demand for products is also increasing, which promotes the development of speech recognition technology. In addition, the built-in voice recognition system also has the advantages of small size, low power consumption, low cost, good portability and high reliability. Therefore, the built-in voice recognition system is larger and has practical value. With the advent of the information age, various technological forms based on digital networks have quickly and effectively penetrated into every corner of social development and life. Craft advertising is an innovation of traditional advertising. This model makes full use of its own interactivity, accuracy and diversity, can effectively make up for the shortcomings of traditional advertising, and surpass traditional crafts through a new expression and communication model. Therefore, this article discusses the application of computer image software technology in embedded voice and craft advertising design.

AB Audience feedback measurement system is a highly researched field in the scientific and marketing community. Therefore, it is an important task to know what the customer feels about their services or goods. It is also interest to other users who want information and feedback on their services. Cloud Services are essential for up and coming entrepreneurs who want to expand their enterprises without expending too much capital on infrastructure. For this purpose, a cloud ranking or recommendation system is highly necessary to choose a cloud service provider as per their needs. Usually, available rating systems give crisp values as their output, which fails to capture the intrinsic vagueness and uncertainty naturally present while users give their feedback. The main aim of this paper is to minimize uncertainty and vagueness in fuzzy logic systems. Therefore, we propose a general type-2 fuzzy set to interval-valued responses of user ratings on cloud services. The proposed method captures the uncertainty which is present in all ratings that crisp or absolute ratings fail to capture. Specifically, we convert the type-1 fuzzy set to general type-2 fuzzy sets and extract the Z slices which represent the feedback of the users with no loss of data. In particular, we gather data from users over a period of 3 weeks and ascertain the intra- and inter-user agreement on the cloud services.

AB Process mining provides a collection of techniques to gain insights into business processes by analyzing event logs. Organizations can gain various insights into their business processes by using process mining techniques. Such techniques use event logs extracted from relational databases supporting the business process as input. However, extracting event logs is challenging due to the size of the data, and it remains ad-hoc. Existing commercial tools partly support the extraction of event logs, but they are proprietary and focus on the mainstream processes such as Purchase-To-Pay (P2P) and Order-To-Cash (O2C). Moreover, the extracted event logs suffer from well-known deficiency, convergence, and divergence issues. For example, due to convergence events are unintentionally duplicated causing unreliable or confusing performance diagnostics. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract event logs while avoiding the aforementioned issues. More in detail, we extract object-centric event logs by using an abstraction layer of the database, called Graph of Relationships (GoRs), designing blueprints with domain knowledge, and converting the database and blueprint into object-centric event logs.We fully implemented the proposed approach, which can extract object-centric event logs from SAP ERP systems, and evaluate the utility and scalability of the proposed approach.

AB This article studies the application for customer churn prediction on webcast. Predicting churn customers become an urgent need in webcast industry because the market is getting saturated and identifying potential churn customers and developing recall marketing strategies can save companies significant costs. Despite the importance of customer churn prediction in many fields, little prior academic attention has been attached to the webcast area. To address this gap, We apply an ensemble learning method to build a binary classification model for customer churn prediction. Our proposed model uses a weighted voting ensemble method and the Nelder-Mead optimal algorithm with a specific focus on the speed of Internet customers' mobility, extracting high-dimensional features from time series data to incorporate more detailed customer behavior information. In addition, a new customer churn indicator based on time decline is introduced to more accurately define churned customers in the training data. The experimental data is collected from a webcast application developed by a Chinese Internet company. Experimental evaluations show that compared to the traditional ensemble models, our proposed model is operationally efficient and outperforms other approaches, providing valuable insights for companies to intervene with churned customers and adopt targeting retention interventions.

AB Face alignment is a hot topic in the field of computer vision because it is an important intermediate step in face recognition, 3D face reconstruction, etc. Its task is to locate the key parts of the human face with landmarks. For the lack of shape constraints and weak correlation between landmarks in face alignment based on Gaussian heatmap regression, this paper presents a novel method combining shape constraints with Gaussian heatmap regression network. Our method consists of a 3D model parameter prediction network, an attention map generator, and a Gaussian heatmap regression network. The 3D model parameter prediction network fits the 3D face model and sample face. The attention map generator can generate an attention map containing shape constraint information based on the fitting results. The attention map and the original image will be used together as the input of the Gaussian heatmap regression network to achieve coarse to fine face alignment. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has a lower error on multiple mainstream datasets and is robust for some complex samples compared with the Gaussian heatmap regression method without shape constraints.

ID OSTEOSARCOMA SEGMENTATION; NETWORK
AB Due to the improvement in computing power and the development of computer technology, deep learning has pene-trated into various fields of the medical industry. Segmenting lesion areas in medical scans can help clinicians make accurate diagnoses. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a dominant tool in computer vision tasks. They can accurately locate and classify lesion areas. However, due to their inherent inductive bias, CNNs may lack an understanding of long-term dependencies in medical images, leading to less accurate grasping of details in the images. To address this problem, we explored a Transformer-based solution and studied its feasibility in medical imaging tasks (OstT). First, we performed super-resolution reconstruction on the original MRI image of osteosarcoma and improved the texture features of the tissue structure to reduce the error caused by the unclear tissue structure in the image during model training. Then, we propose a Transformer-based method for medical image segmentation. A gated axial attention model is used, which augments existing architectures by introducing an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module to improve segmentation accuracy. Experiments on real datasets show that our method outper-forms existing models such as Unet. It can effectively assist doctors in imaging examinations.

AB Class imbalance poses new challenges when it comes to classifying data streams. Many algorithms recently proposed in the literature tackle this problem using a variety of data-level, algorithm-level, and ensemble approaches. However, there is a lack of standardized and agreed-upon procedures and benchmarks on how to evaluate these algorithms. This work proposes a standardized, exhaustive, and comprehensive experimental framework to evaluate algorithms in a collection of diverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental study evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced data streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios, instance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic datasets in binary and multi-class scenarios. This leads to a large-scale experimental study comparing state-of-the-art classifiers in the data stream mining domain. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art classifiers in each of these scenarios and we provide general recommendations to end-users for selecting the best algorithms for imbalanced data streams. Additionally, we formulate open challenges and future directions for this domain. Our experimental framework is fully reproducible and easy to extend with new methods. This way, we propose a standardized approach to conducting experiments in imbalanced data streams that can be used by other researchers to create complete, trustworthy, and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods. Our experimental framework can be downloaded from https://github.com/canoalberto/imbalanced-streams.

AB Unsupervised dimensionality reduction (DR) aims to preserve input data structure in a low-dimensional (LD) space based on neighborhood information. In contrast, supervised DR intends to improve the learning performance, i.e., classification and regression, in an LD representation. Unfortunately, obtaining the complete label outputs of a data set for real-world applications is hard. Here, we introduce a novel DR framework coupling both available class labels and input feature similarities to extend the well-known t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) for semi-supervised scenarios. Our proposal, termed Semi-Supervised t-SNE (SS.t-SNE), properly fixes the widths of Gaussian neighborhoods to reveal the salient local and global data structures in an LD space. Indeed, our approach is presented as a generalization of unsupervised and supervised versions of t-SNE. SS.t-SNE outperforms other semi-supervised DR methods in data visualization and classification tasks in LD embeddings.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Few-shot learning; Lottery ticket hypothesis
ID SCALE-SPACE METHODS
AB Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) [14] has gathered great focus since being proposed. Researchers then succeed in figuring out alternative ways to find the "winning ticket" and extending the vanilla version to various kinds of situations ranging from image segmentation to language pretraining. However, these works all emphasize fully supervised learning with plenty of training instances, whilst they ignore the important scenario of learning from few examples, i.e., Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Different from classical many-shot learning tasks, the common FSL setting assumes the disjoint of source and target categories. To the best of our knowledge, the lottery ticket hypothesis has for the first time, systematically studied in few-shot learning scenarios. To validate the hypothesis, we conduct extensive experiments on several few-shot learning methods with three widely-used datasets, miniImageNet, CUB, CIFARFS. Results reveal that we can even find "winning tickets" for some high-performance methods. In addition, our experiments on Cross-Domain FSL further validates the transferability of the found "winning tickets". Furthermore, the process of finding LTH can be costly. So we study the early-stage LTH for FSL via exploring the Inverse Scale Space(ISS). Empirical results validate the efficacy of early-stage LTH. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite the vast research on many-objective optimisation problems, the presence of many objective functions is still a challenge worthy of further study. A way to treat this kind of problem is to incorporate the preferences of the decision maker (DM) into the optimisation process. In this paper, we introduce an interactive ant colony optimisation combined with an ordinal classification method in which classes are described by characteristic profiles. Through several interactions, the DM is supposed to identify some representative solutions of the classes 'satisfactory' and 'dissatisfactory,' which are used to initialise an ordinal classifier that increases the selective pressure by discriminating in favour of the 'satisfactory' class. This method can work with any either asymmetric or symmetric binary preference relation, a feature that confers a very wide generality. As another advantage, the interaction with the DM has minimal cognitive demands, which is an advisable feature for any approach based on interaction. Although the preference model is quite general, the proposal was tested using an eclectic model which combines compensatory preferences, veto conditions, and interval numbers to handle imprecise values; those preferences are aggregated in an asymmetric preference relation. Our approach performs particularly well in 10-objective problems according to the standards in the state-of-the-art literature. Numerical results and tests for statistical significance on the DTLZ and WFG test suites support this claim.

AB Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) is a crucial preprocessing step for underwater vision tasks. Addressing the challenge of training supervised deep learning models on large, diverse datasets while learning the intrinsic degradation factors of underwater images is essential for improving model generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a Weak-Strong Dual Supervised Generative Adversarial Network (WSDS-GAN) for UIE. During the first weakly supervised learning phase, unpaired images, consisting of degraded underwater images and clear in-air images, are used to train the model with the goal of recovering color, brightness, and content. In the second strongly supervised learning phase, a limited number of paired images are fed into the model to further train the image detail recovery generator. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and self-photographed images demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally, we show that our method significantly enhances image details to support subsequent underwater vision tasks.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study was aimed at comparing the differences in image textures of windfall apple samples dried using different non-thermal and thermal techniques without and with ultrasound pretreatment. Six classes of sliced windfall apple samples, such as freeze-dried (control), freeze-dried (ultrasound pretreatment), greenhouse-dried (control), greenhouse-dried (ultrasound pretreatment), open-sun-dried (control), and open-sun-dried (ultrasound pretreatment) were obtained. The models to distinguish apple samples were developed based on selected image textures using machine learning algorithms. In the first step of the analysis, all six classes were distinguished. Then, apple samples were classified in pairs without and with ultrasound pretreatment to determine the effect of pretreatment on apple structure. Additionally, models were built to distinguish three control samples from each other as well as separately to classify three samples with ultrasound pretreatment. In the case of the classification of all six apple samples, an overall accuracy reached 80.83% for a model built using a Logistic Model Tree algorithm from the group of Trees and there were no mixing cases between freeze-dried without and with ultrasound pretreatment and samples dried using other techniques. Samples freeze-dried without and with ultrasound pretreatment were distinguished from each other with an accuracy reaching 95% (Random Forest from Trees). Greenhouse-dried (control) and greenhouse-dried with ultrasound pretreatment apple samples were classified with an accuracy of up to 93.5% (Bayes Net from Bayes). Whereas an accuracy reached 95% (Bayes Net) for the classification of open-sun-dried (control) vs. open-sun-dried with ultrasound pretreatment apples. Apple samples dried using freeze drying, greenhouse drying and open-sun drying without pretreatment were distinguished with an overall accuracy of up to 83.67% (Random Forest), and samples dried by freeze drying, greenhouse drying and open-sun drying with ultrasound pretreatment - with an accuracy of up to 93.67% (Bayes Net). The developed models may be used in practice to distinguish apple samples dried using different techniques and samples dried with and without pretreatment.

ID EXPRESSION
AB Facial action units (AUs) recognition becomes important for facial analysis and has been widely applied in psychological research. Existing work on AU relationship learning only considers the relationship between AUs simultaneously, and does not consider the complex co-adaptation between AUs. Co adaptation is good, but not always good. Learning the AU relationship simultaneously will inhibit the robust features of network learning. And AU relationship learning often requires additional landmark information. To solve these problems, we propose a novel AU Drop-relationship learning inspired by dropout. The AU Drop-relationship learning constructs the AU relationship units through prior knowledge. We further design the relationship regularization module to constraint the relationship between AU pairs. We randomly drop AU relationship units during training to suppress co-adaptation, forcing the network to learn more robust features. In addition, considering that there are massive unlabeled web facial images in reality, manual labeling of AU requires experts and is particularly timeconsuming. To address this problem, we propose a method composed of consistency regularization and pseudo-multi-labeling for semi-supervised AU recognition. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised and supervised methods on two widely used AU datasets (BP4D and DISFA).& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Preprocessing of structural MRI involves multiple steps to clean and standardize data before further analysis. Typically, researchers use numerous tools to create tailored preprocessing workflows that adjust to their dataset. This process hinders research reproducibility and transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroNorm, a robust and reproducible preprocessing pipeline that addresses the challenges of preparing structural MRI data. NeuroNorm adapts its workflow to the input datasets without manual intervention and uses state-of-the-art methods to guarantee high-standard results. We demonstrate NeuroNorm's strength by preprocessing hundreds of MRI scans from three different sources with specific parameters on image dimensions, voxel intensity ranges, patients characteristics, acquisition protocols and scanner type. The preprocessed images can be visually and analytically compared to each other as they share the same geometrical and intensity space. NeuroNorm supports clinicians and researchers with a robust, adaptive and comprehensible preprocessing pipeline, increasing and certifying the sensitivity and validity of subsequent analyses. NeuroNorm requires minimal user inputs and interaction, making it a userfriendly set of tools for users with basic programming experience. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB How do you make inferences from a Bayesian network (BN) model with missing information? For example, we may not have priors for some variables or may not have conditionals for some states of the parent variables. It is well-known that the Dempster Shafer (D-S) belief function theory is a generalization of probability theory. So, a solution is to embed an incomplete BN model in a D-S belief function model, omit the missing data, and then make inferences from the belief function model. We will demonstrate this using an implementation of a local computation algorithm for D-S belief function models called the "Belief function machine." One advantage of this approach is that we get interval estimates of the probabilities of interest. Using Laplacian (equally likely) or maximum entropy priors or conditionals for missing data in a BN may lead to point estimates for the probabilities of interest, masking the uncertainty in these estimates. Bayesian reasoning cannot reason from an incomplete model. A Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the missing parameters is not a substitute for a belief-function analysis.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB The self-organizing map (SOM) represents high-dimensional input samples by a 2-dimensional output topological structure, whereby similar input samples are mapped onto the same output unit or neighboring units on a map for visualization. Although many extended SOM models have been proposed, the need to determine a grid structure of SOM before learning, and the lack of adaptability to rapid changes in input data have not yet been fully overcome. This research proposes an adaptive growing grid (AGG) model, which is a novel neural self-organizing map (SOM), for projecting high-dimensional input samples onto an output grid. Due to the need for a grid structure for visualization, the AGG uses both growing and pruning functions and an adaptive learning process in order to adapt its output grid structure and learning function to constantly and rapidly changing input data in a non-stationary environment. The proposed AGG is tested on four basic data sets and one cross-domain data set. In addition, the t-test is used to test whether the proposed AGG outperforms the benchmark model, the growing grid (GG). Based on three evaluation measures, i.e. average quantization error (AQE), topographic error (TE) and dead unit ratio (DUR), the AGG significantly outperforms the GG in a non-stationary environment.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Different analytical techniques, mixing single and multi-block chemometric analyses in supervised and unsu-pervised approaches, and the selection of variables in the coffee discrimination domain have been reported. Molecular and atomic spectroscopic techniques (1H NMR, portable NIR, benchtop NIR, ATR-FTIR-MIR, and FAAS) were used to characterize and discriminate Brazilian Canephora coffees of specific producers, including two with geographical indication, and also to differentiate them from the Arabica. The sample set comprised 100 Canephora samples of different geographical origins in Brazil (Conilon from Espirito Santo, Amazonian Robusta from indigenous and non-indigenous producers of Rondo<SIC>nia, and Conilon from Bahia) and Arabica coffee (25 samples). ComDim exploratory multi-block analysis was first used to evaluate the contributions of all the different data blocks that characterized the samples and determine the calibration and validation sets. Multi -block discrimination by the SO-PLS-LDA was then used to validate the feasibility of discrimination, and to identify the relevant analytical techniques. The discrimination based on all the blocks presented 100% correct discrimination on training, cross-validation, and test sets, and suggested that only a single block (benchtop NIR) is needed to achieve a perfect discrimination. PLS-DA was then applied to the data from portable NIR to evaluate whether comparable performances could be achieved; all test samples were correctly discriminated with the exception of two Robusta Amazo<SIC>nico from non-indigenous producers and two Conilon from Espirito Santo, indicating that very accurate results can be obtained also using a portable instrument. Finally, the use of CovSel-DA allowed the discrimination to be optimized on the most cost-effective analytical technique (portable NIR). CovSel-LDA models selected the best variables for benchtop and portable NIR, impacting positively portable NIR performance and suggesting that portable NIR could bring comparable or at least only slightly worse perfor-mance than benchtop NIR for discrimination.

AB This paper proposes a distributed neurodynamic algorithm for sparse signal reconstruction by addressing P1-minimization problems. Firstly, a P1-minimization problem is transformed into a distributed model, drawing support from multi-agent consensus theory. Secondly, to address this distributed model, a novel distributed neurodynamic algorithm is proposed by employing derivative feedback and projection operator. It is proved that the proposed neurodynamic algorithm is globally convergent by utilizing the properties of projection operator and set-valued system. Moreover, compared with the existing distributed neurodynamic algorithms, the proposed neurodynamic algorithm is inverse-free and does not involve any matrix decomposition. Finally, some experimental results on sparse signal reconstruction indicate the effectiveness of the proposed neurodynamic algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud computing is considerably investigable and adoptable in both industry and academia, and Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been applied in cloud computing. Although SDN mitigates some security issues in cloud computing, new security issues related to its own architecture are also introduced. In this paper, we propose a quantum walks-based classification model which is available for intrusion detection in cloud computing. The proposed model concentrates feature information of data via Principal Component Analysis, and then aggregates the concentrated data in the way of quantum walks by a training-free clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm constructs coin transformation and conditional shift transformation based on transition probabilities to move similar data toward each other. To enhance the usability of the proposed model in cloud computing security, we propose a new cloud architecture which adds security layer in SDN to ponder the protection of cloud computing fundamentally, and simplify transition probabilities equations of clustering algorithm without affecting clustering accuracy, decreasing the time complexity from O(nk2) to O(nk). The experimental results on popular datasets (Accuracy: 99.4% on InSDN, 95.8% on NSL-KDD, 98% on UNSW-NB15 and 96.4% on CSE-CIC-IDS2018) revealed that the proposed model is effective dealing with attacks on SDN-based cloud computing, and is able to maintain stable and excellent attack identification ability under different traffic intensities.

TI How Much Do Language Models Copy From Their Training Data? Evaluating
   Linguistic Novelty in Text Generation Using RAVEN
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Current language models can generate high-quality text. Are they simply copying text they have seen before, or have they learned generalizable linguistic abstractions? To tease apart these possibilities, we introduce RAVEN, a suite of analyses for assessing the novelty of generated text, focusing on sequential structure (n-grams) and syntactic structure. We apply these analyses to four neural language models trained on English (an LSTM, a Transformer, Transformer-XL, and GPT-2). For local structure-e.g., individual dependencies-text generated with a standard sampling scheme is substantially less novel than our baseline of human-generated text from each model's test set. For larger-scale structure-e.g., overall sentence structure-model-generated text is as novel or even more novel than the human-generated baseline, but models still sometimes copy substantially, in some cases duplicating passages over 1,000 words long from the training set. We also perform extensive manual analysis, finding evidence that GPT-2 uses both compositional and analogical generalization mechanisms and showing that GPT-2's novel text is usually well-formed morphologically and syntactically but has reasonably frequent semantic issues (e.g., being self-contradictory).

DT Article
AB Recent work has shown that Aspect-Term Sentiment Analysis (ATSA) can be effectively performed by Gradual Machine Learning (GML). However, the performance of the current unsupervised solution is limited by inaccurate and insufficient knowledge conveyance. In this paper, we propose a supervised GML approach for ATSA, which can effectively exploit labeled training data to improve knowledge conveyance. It leverages binary polarity relations between instances, which can be either similar or opposite, to enable supervised knowledge conveyance. Besides the explicit polarity relations indicated by discourse structures, it also separately supervises a polarity classification DNN and a binary Siamese network to extract implicit polarity relations. The proposed approach fulfills knowledge conveyance by modeling detected relations as binary features in a factor graph. Our extensive experiments on real benchmark data show that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance across all the test workloads. Our work demonstrates clearly that, in collaboration with DNN for feature extraction, GML outperforms pure DNN solutions.

AB In this paper, we study a two-dimensional vehicle loading and routing problem in which customer orders with deadlines become available for dispatch as per their release dates. The objective is to minimize the sum of transportation, inventory, and tardiness costs while respecting various loading and routing constraints. This scenario allows us to study various tradeoffs that tend to arise due to temporal order aggregation across release dates. We thereby propose an integrated mathematical formulation to simultaneously model both the routing and loading requirements of the problem at hand. Specifically, as the problem is NP-hard, we propose a scatter search-based heuristic approach to solve large-size instances. Further, its performance is enhanced using problem-specific procedures and strategic oscillation approaches. Additionally, the numerical experiments illustrate the influence of cost structures on both the optimal loading configurations along with the optimal routes. Importantly, our experiments also suggest that the proposed scatter search method can produce goodquality solutions in less time.

AB Multiagent systems face numerous challenges due to environmental uncertainty, with scalability being a critical issue. To address this, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative model based on a graph attention network. Our approach considers the relationship between agents and continuous action spaces, utilizing graph convolution and recurrent neural networks to define these relationships. Graph convolution is used to define the relationship between agents, while recurrent neural networks define continuous action spaces. We optimize and model the multiagent system by encoding the interaction weights among agents using the graph neural network and the weights between continuous action spaces using the recurrent neural network. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model by conducting experimental simulations using a 3D wargame engine that involves several unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) acting as attackers and radar stations acting as defenders, where both sides have the ability to detect each other.

TI Feature selection using symmetric uncertainty and hybrid optimization

AB Recently, when handling high-dimensional data, it has become extremely difficult to search this optimal subset of selected features due to the restriction of reducing the exponential increase of the search procedure, and most of those feature selection models neglect the interactions of features or feature and decision class. This paper develops a novel feature selection approach using symmetric uncertainty and hybrid optimization for high-dimensional data (FSUHO) for high-dimensional data. First, to fully reflect the interaction relationship of features or feature and decision class, the F-relevance between features and the C-correlation between feature and decision class based on the symmetric uncertainty are constructed to remove those redundant features. Then, a strong correlation threshold is improved based on the C-correlation and random coefficient to prevent the removal of the effective features in this first stage. Second, to decrease this expensive computational consumption, one criterion for judging a weakly correlated feature is designed to sort all features, and another criterion is developed to select the class center. The similarity between features and class centers is calculated, and similar features are clustered into one class. Then, the symmetric uncertainty correlation-based feature clustering model can be constructed in this second stage. In the third stage, a hybrid optimization approach of particle swarm optimizer (PSO) and wild horse optimizer (WHO) for feature selection is proposed, where the association-guided group initialization probability with a multiobjective optimized particle selection scheme is defined as a criterion for the PSO in selecting stallion particles for the WHO, and the improved WHO is developed by integrating the nonlinear inertial weight factor and the Brownian motion operator to obtain the optimal subset of selected features. Finally, a novel three-stage feature selection algorithm is developed. Experimental results apply to 16 datasets prove the efficiency of FSUHO in tackling high-dimensional feature selection problems in metrics of classification accuracy and running time.

AB The drug management currently carried out in hospitals is inadequate due to several factors, such as processes carried out manually, the lack of visibility of the hospital supply chain, the lack of standardized identification of medicines, inefficient stock management, an inability to follow the traceability of medicines, and poor data exploitation. Disruptive information technologies could be used to develop and implement a drug management system in hospitals that is innovative in all its phases and allows these problems to be overcome. However, there are no examples in the literature that show how these technologies can be used and combined for efficient drug management in hospitals. To help solve this research gap in the literature, this article proposes a computer architecture for the whole drug management process in hospitals that uses and combines different disruptive computer technologies such as blockchain, radio frequency identification (RFID), quick response code (QR), Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and big data, for data capture, data storage and data exploitation throughout the whole drug management process, from the moment the drug enters the hospital until it is dispensed and eliminated.

AB Feature selection can effectively decrease data dimensions by selecting a relevant feature subset. Rough set theory provides a powerful theoretical framework for the feature selection of categorical data with complete labels. However, in reality, the given datasets have only a small number of objects with label information and many unlabelled objects. Furthermore, most of feature selection approaches are computationally expensive. To address the above problems, a semisupervised feature selection algorithm based on neighbourhood discernibility with pseudolabelled granular balls is proposed. First, the set of granular balls based on the purity is generated, which reduces the universe space by sampling. Then, the neighbourhood discernibility is proposed to validate the importance of the candidate features for both labelled and unlabelled objects. Finally, an ensemble voting algorithm is designed to execute feature selection, and a feature subset with satisfactory performance is selected fairly not arbitrarily. On UCI datasets, experimental results verify the advantage of the proposed feature selection algorithm in terms of the feature subset size, classification accuracy and computational time against other algorithms.

AB Pattern classification has always been essential in computer vision. Transformer paradigm having attention mechanism with global receptive field in computer vision improves the efficiency and effectiveness of visual object detection and recognition. The primary purpose of this article is to achieve the accurate ripeness classification of various types of fruits. We create fruit datasets to train, test, and evaluate multiple Transformer models. Transformers are fundamentally composed of encoding and decoding procedures. The encoder is to stack the blocks, like convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet). Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are considered in this paper. We examine the advantages of these three models for accurately analyzing fruit ripeness. We find that Swin Transformer achieves more significant outcomes than ViT Transformer for both pears and apples from our dataset.

ID SUPPORT
AB Anomaly detection is a classical problem of identifying whether a query is an inlier or an outlier, with only inliers available during training. Reconstruction error is regarded to be a good metric for anomaly detection in many approaches, while they ignore the data distribution of inliers. In this study, we present a novel model leveraging data distribution and reconstruction error for anomaly detection. To obtain a model for anomaly detection in an unsupervised manner, we train a generative adversarial network and an autoencoder by minimizing the adversarial loss and reconstruction error, where two modules share the parameters of generator and decoder. Directly combining the autoencoder and generative models faces the challenge that the encoded vectors do not always follow the fixed prior distribution of the input of generator. To address this challenge, we propose a simple strategy that is theoretically guaranteed under proper conditions. Based on the training process, we propose a novel normality score combining the reconstruction error and the latent density for anomaly detection. In several benchmark datasets, the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art results.

ID ALGORITHM; MATRIX
AB Multi-view data are generally collected from distinct sources or domains characterized by consistent and specific properties. However, most existing multi-view subspace clustering approaches solely encode the self-representation structure through consistent representation or a set of specific representations, leaving the knowledge of the individual view unexploited and resulting in bad performance in self-representation structure. To address this issue, we propose a novel subspace clustering strategy in which the self-representation structure is contemplated through consistent and specific representations. Specifically, we apply the low-rank sparse representation scenario to uncover the global shared representation structure among all the views and deploy the nearest neighboring method to preserve the geometrical structure according to the consistent and specific representation. The L-1-norm and frobenius norm are applied to the consistent and specific representation to promote a sparser solution and guarantee a grouping effect. Besides, a novel objective function is figured out, which goes under the optimization process through the alternating direction technique to evaluate the optimal solution. Finally, experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID VISUAL TRACKING; OBJECT TRACKING; ROBUST
AB Siamese network-based trackers are commonly used for tracking due to their balanced accuracy and speed. However, the fixed template from the initial frame is used to localize the target in the current frame, and never being updated in Siamese trackers. This loses the power of updating the appearance model online and easily induces tracking failures for the intrinsic properties of tracking processes such as constantly changing scenes and endless distractors. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective visual tracking framework for updating the appearance model in a novel formulation that introduces a peculiar mixup method both for training and inference phase of Siamese trackers (named PMUM-Siam). It consists of a template matching network and a mixup module. First, instead of center-cropping the inexact predictions for tracking, we use the template matching network which trained with predefined anchor boxes to learn to select the best candidate from similar distractors. Second, the mixup module is used to fuse and update the trade-off appearance model between the best candidate and the groundtruth. Our method greatly enhances the capability of target identification and target localization in Siamese trackers. To further demonstrate the generality of the proposed method, we integrate our PMUM-Siam into two representative Siamese trackers (SiamFC and SiamRPN+ +). Extensive experimental results and comparisons on five challenging object tracking benchmarks including OTB-2013, OTB-2015, OTB-50, VOT-2016, and VOT-2018 show that PMUM-Siam achieves leading performance with an average speed of 300 FPS.

AB We present FRMT, a new dataset and evaluation benchmark for Few-shot Region-aware Machine Translation, a type of style-targeted translation. The dataset consists of professional translations from English into two regional variants each of Portuguese and Mandarin Chinese. Source documents are selected to enable detailed analysis of phenomena of interest, including lexically distinct terms and distractor terms. We explore automatic evaluation metrics for FRMT and validate their correlation with expert human evaluation across both region-matched and mismatched rating scenarios. Finally, we present a number of baseline models for this task, and offer guidelines for how researchers can train, evaluate, and compare their own models. Our dataset and evaluation code are publicly available: https://bit.ly/frmt-task.

TI OpenFact: Factuality Enhanced Open Knowledge Extraction
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB We focus on the factuality property during the extraction of an OpenIE corpus named OpenFact, which contains more than 12 million high-quality knowledge triplets. We break down the factuality property into two important aspects-expressiveness and groundedness-and we propose a comprehensive framework to handle both aspects. To enhance expressiveness, we formulate each knowledge piece in OpenFact based on a semantic frame. We also design templates, extra constraints, and adopt human efforts so that most OpenFact triplets contain enough details. For groundedness, we require the main arguments of each triplet to contain linked Wikidata(1) entities. A human evaluation suggests that the OpenFact triplets are much more accurate and contain denser information compared to OPIEC-Linked (Gashteovski et al., 2019), one recent high-quality OpenIE corpus grounded to Wikidata. Further experiments on knowledge base completion and knowledge base question answering show the effectiveness of OpenFact over OPIEC-Linked as supplementary knowledge to Wikidata as the major KG.

AB We propose a novel graph-based approach for semantic parsing that resolves two problems observed in the literature: (1) seq2seq models fail on compositional generalization tasks; (2) previous work using phrase structure parsers cannot cover all the semantic parses observed in treebanks. We prove that both MAP inference and latent tag anchoring (required for weakly-supervised learning) are NP-hard problems. We propose two optimization algorithms based on constraint smoothing and conditional gradient to approximately solve these inference problems. Experimentally, our approach delivers state-of-the-art results on GeoQuery, Scan, and Clevr, both for i.i.d. splits and for splits that test for compositional generalization.

DE Important-data-based (IDB) denial-of-service (DoS) attack mechanism;
   networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems; resilient Hop fuzzy filter
ID STATE ESTIMATION; UNCERTAINTIES
AB This article is concerned with the security problems for networked Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with asyn-chronous premise constraints. The primary objective of this article is twofold. First, a novel important-data-based (IDB) denial-of-service (DoS) attack mechanism is proposed from the perspective of the adversary for the first time to reinforce the destructive effect of the DoS attacks. Different from most existing DoS attack models, the proposed attack mechanism can utilize the information of packets, evaluate the importance degree of packets, and only attack the most "important" ones. As such, a larger system performance degradation can be expected. Second, corresponding to the proposed IDB DoS mechanism, a resilient Hop fuzzy filter is designed from the defender's point of view to alleviate the negative effect of the attack. Furthermore, since the defender does not know the attack parameter, an algorithm is designed to estimate it. In a word, a unified attack-defense framework is developed in this article for networked T-S fuzzy systems with asynchronous premise constraints. With the help of the Lyapunov functional method, sufficient conditions are suc-cessfully established to compute the desired filtering gains and ensure the Hop performance of the filtering error system. Finally, two examples are exploited to demonstrate the destructiveness of the proposed IDB DoS attack and the usefulness of the developed resilient Hop filter.

AB We propose a non-representationalist framework for deep learning relying on a novel method computational phenomenology, a dialogue between the first-person perspective (relying on phenomenology) and the mechanisms of computational models. We thereby propose an alternative to the modern cognitivist interpretation of deep learning, according to which artificial neural networks encode representations of external entities. This interpretation mainly relies on neuro-representationalism, a position that combines a strong ontological commitment towards scientific theoretical entities and the idea that the brain operates on symbolic representations of these entities. We proceed as follows: after offering a review of cognitivism and neuro-representationalism in the field of deep learning, we first elaborate a phenomenological critique of these positions; we then sketch out computational phenomenology and distinguish it from existing alternatives; finally we apply this new method to deep learning models trained on specific tasks, in order to formulate a conceptual framework of deep-learning, that allows one to think of artificial neural networks' mechanisms in terms of lived experience.

We prove that this problem is NP-complete in general if k is a parameter of the problem and is in P if the interaction digraph is strongly connected. The case where k is fixed, but the interaction digraph is not strongly connected, remains open. Furthermore, we study some variations of the decision problem: given a conjunctive Boolean network, does there exist a block-sequential (resp. sequential) update schedule such that there is a limit cycle of length k? We prove that these problems are NP-complete for any fixed constant k = 2.

DE Supply chain structuring; Community detection; Module gravitation;

ID VISUALIZATION; COLLABORATION; FRAMEWORK; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS
AB As industrial production outsourcing expands, the collaboration relationship of firms evolves to be more entangled, which means that the enterprise communities in the supply chain network become increasingly overlapping and their boundaries are ambiguous. Given the network complexity, deeper insight into the sequencing orders of suppliers and assemblers is required to orchestrate the supply chain partner collaboration. Considering the overlapping community and multi-layered connectivity characteristics of the supply chain network, in this paper, we design a gravitation-based hierarchical community detection algorithm for structuring the supply chain network. The solution applies a functional modules identification strategy based on node gravitation and a hierarchical clustering strategy based on module gravitation to structure the supply chain network architecture. The key technique is to investigate the global gravitational influence of focal firms, segment the functional modules by characterizing the overlapping conditions among communities, and construct the dendrogram by measuring the gravitational forces between modules in order to map the hierarchical architecture of the dendrogram to structure the supply chain network. The proposed algorithm does not necessitate a prior knowledge about the network. It is adaptable to construct the supply chain network that exhibits scale-free, highly overlapped modular community, and hierarchical characteristics. Experimental results on synthetic benchmark and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed algorithm.

AB The rapid development of urbanization in China has contributed to traffic events, such as traffic accidents and delays. It is difficult to detect and resolve highway traffic congestion in a timely manner using traditional methods because they are slow, require a large number of workers, and require the installation of a large amount of monitoring equipment. Therefore, it is imperative to introduce advanced technology to address these challenges. Recently, deep learning technology has made significant breakthroughs and has been widely applied to various fields with satisfactory results. Deep learning is among the most important technologies for the detection and evaluation of traffic congestion, enabling the accurate detection of the state of the expressway network's traffic congestion, the evaluation of traffic congestion, and the prediction of possible traffic congestion. This enables management to formulate traffic dredging strategies in advance to prevent the negative impact of traffic congestion on normal traffic flow. This paper proposes a framework based on deep learning for next-generation highway traffic management. This framework selects traffic congestion indicators to construct an index model, and then constructs a deep learning model based on self-coding. It predicts and classifies highway traffic environment data and excavates sample data based on the characteristics of traffic parameters. As soon as traffic data were classified, a prediction model based on SoftMax was established to detect and predict highway traffic congestion. We conducted a traffic congestion analysis of the Shanghai expressway network based on the speed performance data obtained from the China Traffic Management Bureau. As a result of their research, we developed an index to measure highway traffic congestion. For traffic control and management organizations to function effectively, it is crucial to have an accurate and clear picture of traffic network operations. We evaluated the proposed framework using data gathered from highway monitoring scenes, and the results indicated that 98.6% of the data could be correctly detected. Using the prediction model based on SoftMax for expressway vehicles during peak hours, the accuracy was 92%, and the misjudgment rate was 8%. This study demonstrates that detecting and evaluating the state of highway traffic environments using deep learning has high accuracy, can be applied to actual highway traffic systems, and is extremely useful for detecting highway congestion. This framework is a promising solution for next-generation highway traffic management and provides accurate and timely traffic congestion detection and evaluation.

AB The rapid advancements in big data techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a radical transformation of the tourism industry, resulting in the development of smart tourism services and products. Big data and AI algorithms allow smart tourist services and products that prioritize the customers' experience. Big data and AI-enabled smart tourism aim to improve consumer satisfaction and offer personalized recommendations. These products and services need to be customized to the evolving needs of the tourists by providing exceptional experiences. This study proposes a Decision Tree algorithm for smart tourist products and services based on user experience and big data techniques. Big data analysis of client satisfaction in smart tourism has led to the development of smart tourism products. In this study, the system components and a design strategy prioritize the users' needs and preferences to generate personalized experiences. Smart tourism services need demand and experience analysis. Smart tourist facilities and big data analysis emphasize the clients' satisfaction. This research examines a smart tourist product service system's logic, data, and visuals. The product services in smart tourism and essential tourist product's service features and subsystems are used to compare tourist initiatives. Customized food, attractions, and lodgings are some of the byproducts of smart tourism product designs. In the proposed study, the real-time decision trees are used to recommend trips based on location, budget, interests, previous remarks, and context. The study suggests timely and relevant information and recommendations depending on the user's location, preferences, and external elements like weather and neighboring events by assuring an uninterrupted experience. Moreover, user input improves the communication based on decision trees to enhance ideas, knowledge, and big data analysis. The decision Tree algorithm improves the experience of users in a smart tourism ecosystem. Tourists enjoy using ideas, quick decision-making tools, and user-driven improvement of tourist experiences by enhancing the quality of products and suggestions.

AB There has been a growing interest in using Internet of Things (IoT) for speech translation in recent years, focusing on practical language applications rather than traditional grammar-based training. The language translation method engages language learners by placing them in effective learning environments. The purpose of English language conversion is primarily to teach non-native speakers' native languages by providing them with a simple and easy-to-understand vocabulary to introduce them to a new language. This study proposes a framework for collaborative privacy management in smart classroom networks based on fuzzy logic decision-making. We used the data sensitivity and confidence values as input variables for the fuzzy system in our framework. Our framework also incorporates trust values between users, because it calculates the trust loss and gain to determine the reputation value. This study investigated the development of an English translation learning system using big data analysis and IoT to enhance students' comprehension of the English language and improve their ability, effectiveness, and proficiency in translation. For this purpose, a client/server (C/S) learning system for English translation on Android devices is proposed. A detailed description is provided of the functionality of each module and database of the system, which is designed using a model-view-controller architecture. Moreover, the system utilizes a three-layer IoT architecture to facilitate wireless connections among Android devices, network translation servers, and speech synthesis servers, thereby providing users with intelligent services. Subsequently, the study applied an enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to analyze English translation learning data. In addition to filtering out irrelevant information from the original dataset, the relief algorithm produces index weights that can be used in the improved fuzzy c-means clustering procedure. The enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is combined with a threshold to create an objective function. Moreover, a unique insight into the English translation learning mode by classifying and clustering English translation resource data is discussed. It was demonstrated that the proposed method achieves high data classification accuracy and significantly enhances the effectiveness and learning outcomes of English translation education.

ID MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION
AB Image analysis and classification perform well in pre-processed noise-free images than in corrupted images. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, Ultrasound (US) medical images, etc. exhibit speckle noise, which has a multiplicative and granular behavior. In the existing techniques, the autoencoders are used to implement a deep learning-based denoising method specifically for US images. The traditional image denoising techniques as well as deep learning techniques for image denoising. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning-based model called, Convolutional-based improved despeckling autoencoder (CIDAE) for denoising transthoracic echocardiographic images. The dataset for the network has been collected from patients having Regional Wall Motion Abnormality (RWMA). There were 294 subjects with routine transthoracic examinations, consisting of 151 RWMA and 143 normal hearts (55.7 percent female, ages 20-75 years). The potential of the proposed DL algorithms was evaluated visually and quantitatively using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), Peak Signal Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Our results demonstrate the significance of the proposed CIDAE for denoising echo images of patients with RWMA and structurally normal hearts with a promising p-value < 0.0001.

AB Skin cancer is an abnormal growth of skin cells. A huge brown area with darker flecks is one of the symbols of skin cancer. It can also change color, size, or feel, and it can bleed. In this research, a novel multi-stage feature extraction-based classification network (MFEC net) has been proposed for detect and identify the skin cancer in early stages. Initially, the images are gathered from the ISIC, DermNet, and PH2 datasets. The lesion images are given as an input to the fuzzy U-net for segmenting the lesion, and the structural-based features are extracted by principal component analysis. The images are also given as input to the feature extraction phase; they include the color level co-occurrence matrix for extracting the color features and the gray-level co-occurrence matrix for extracting the textural features of the lesion. All these three features (color, texture, and edges) are fused using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator technique. Finally, these features are given as input to the deep belief network to classify the skin lesion images into non-cancerous and cancerous stages. The experimentally proposed MFEC net method achieves an overall accuracy of 98.79%. As compared to existing techniques, the proposed MFEC net method shows better simulation results in terms of accuracy, specificity, precision, F1 score, and recall. The proposed MFEC net method improves the overall accuracy of the Mobile Net, SVM, Google Net, and K-means clustering at 96.37%, 95.41%, 96.53%, and 97.26%, respectively.

DE Intelligent medical system; ICU; Incontinence dermatitis; Meta-analysis
AB In recent years, the number of patients with incontinence dermatitis in the ICU has gradually increased, and this condition can cause great harm to patients. Therefore, prevention and treatment of incontinence dermatitis is currently a hot research topic. This paper is to study the nursing effect and effectiveness of intelligent medical systems on patients with incontinence dermatitis in the ICU through meta-analysis methods and provide treatment basis for subsequent treatment of incontinence dermatitis. A randomized controlled experiment was conducted on the nursing effects of different skin protectors on patients with incontinence dermatitis by searching many databases with computers. The retrieval time is from the establishment of the database until April 8, 2023, and a mesh-based meta-analysis is conducted using STATA 16.0 software. A total of 54 articles were included, including 50 studies. The final research results showed that the incidence of incontinence dermatitis in the observation group was lower than that in the control group. There were 53 patients in the observation group who did not experience this condition, 7 patients with mild onset, and 4 patients with moderate onset. The combination of routine care and intelligent medical systems can effectively prevent and treat patients with incontinence dermatitis.

AB The idea of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (qROFSs) is one of the very few reliable tools in computational intelligence. qROFS is more appreciated in terms of applications when explored via distance and similarity operators. Some methods of q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator have been hitherto considered with some applications. However, the outputs from these methods cannot be relied upon for better interpretation due to some drawbacks bothering on exclusion and precision. To this end, this paper develops a hybridized q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator to ameliorate the drawbacks in the already established q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operators. Some theoretical results are outlined to validate the hybridized q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator. To further appreciate the hybridized q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator, we discuss the recognition principle, clustering analysis, and multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) via the developed operators in cases of investment analysis, pattern recognition, classification of students based on their academic strength, and selection of robot for smart manufacturing (SM). Finally, comparative studies of the hybridized q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator in conjunction to the already established operators are conducted to express the edge of the hybridized q-rung orthopair fuzzy distance-similarity operator.

AB Artificial intelligence has developed and advanced to the point where it is now effectively implemented in every domain of life, including music. The music business is being fundamentally changed by shrewd, intellectual methods that rely on AI. These tools make it very easy for musicians to create high-caliber music. Today, sophisticated and clever robots are capable of creating and composing music, one of the most fascinating and priceless works of human ingenuity. Intelligent programs based on artificial intelligence have enabled robots to create beautiful music without the involvement of any humans. The proposed article is focused on the usage of AI-grounded techniques for the learning of music and its classification. It shows that with new technologies, highly interactive interfaces and classrooms can now be developed for the effective and efficient teaching and learning of music. Almost all of the students favor the implementation of such methodologies to improve their performance in music learning and composition. The need for time to employ AI for the quick improvement of the students' musical talent allows them to become professionals in their field. The design of animated courses with the integration of virtual reality and artificial intelligence can enhance the interest of students in learning and developing their skills. The study then acquired various important characteristics from the existing literature in the area of research and selected the most common ones. Then, with the implementation of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), these features are assigned weights. For the ranking of the alternatives, the method of multi-objective optimization on the basis of research analysis was utilized. AI-based methods in music education have several advantages and are revolutionizing how students learn about and interact with music. Personalized learning, accessible education, improved practice and performance, help with composition and arrangement, and music theory and analysis are some of the main benefits.

AB With the rapid development of technology today, people have ushered in the era of big data, and artificial neural networks have become popular in various fields. For example, classifying images, recognizing speech, and automatically driving machines, when applying artificial neural networks to the field of optics, not only can computational efficiency be greatly improved, but also the quality of imaging is greatly improved. The optical neural network developed using photons as a medium not only improves the shortcomings of traditional neural networks, but also has the advantages of fast speed and low loss. In recent years, optical instrument has developed rapidly and can be seen in the field of precision measurement and aerospace. When manufacturing optical instrument, the main process is divided into three parts: processing, assembly and testing. However, errors cannot be avoided during the processing and assembly process. Therefore, after the installation and adjustment, it is necessary to measure the position of the system's optical axis again, using the remeasured optical axis as the reference, in order to ensure more accurate accuracy in the subsequent use process. If the measured optical axis and the actual optical axis do not reach consistency in position, this will cause eccentricity, leading to a decrease in subsequent imaging performance. Therefore, in order to solve this problem, this paper will propose a calibration method using optical instrument as test measurement based on artificial neural network.

AB Stomach cancer is a common and fatal malignancy. In contrast, PD-1 expression in stomach cancer tissue may be associated with the outcome of gastric cancer overall survival. This paper focuses on the association between PD-1 expression in tumour tissues of gastrointestinal cancer and patient prognosis using a meta-analysis approach. By searching for articles published in September 2022 in PubMed, EBSCO, Web of Science and Cochrane Library, we have collected articles on the link that exists between the presence of PD-1 expression in the tissue of tumours of patients with stomach cancer and the general outcome of survival in patients with stomach cancer. HR values and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to evaluate the relationship and prognosis of GC with PD-1 level of expression in tumour cells of stomach cancer. Meta-analysis package 5.2-0 of R language is used for meta-analysis. This study included nine articles with a total of 2552 patients. The meta-analysis indicated that increased protein expression of PD-L1 did not necessarily indicate a worse overall prognosis (HR = 1.29, 95%CI: 0.83-2.01). Therefore, the level of PD-L1 expression was not necessarily related to the prognosis of gastric cancer patients.

AB Currently, there are many character string segmentation algorithms, and these algorithms all have the common advantages of good versatility. However, they require a lot of calculations, path searches, etc., which lead to complex algorithm structures and high time and space complexity. This paper proposes an intelligent recognition model of English characters based on point cloud data model and artificial intelligence recognition. Moreover, this paper designs a data point reduction algorithm to eliminate and filter data points in the curve and surface fitting process, and uses comparative experiments to verify that the algorithm can reduce the number of data points used for fitting curves and surfaces while ensuring fitting accuracy and improve fitting efficiency. In addition, this paper uses the processed point cloud data and the extracted and parsed two-dimensional engineering drawing data to improve the expression of the B-spline curve with the theoretical support of the B-spline curve and the B-spline surface. Finally, this paper designs a control experiment to analyze the performance of the model. The research results show that the model constructed in this paper has certain reliability.

AB Image segmentation through fuzzy clustering has been widely used in diverse areas. However, most of those clustering algorithms require that some of their parameter values be determined manually. The number of clusters, C, is one of the most important parameters because it impacts the number of regions to segment and directly affects the performance of the clustering algorithms. Some state-of-the-art general clustering algorithms methods automatically determine C. However, not all of them can be employed for image segmentation. Therefore, this paper describes the method automatic estimation of number of clusters by image complexity (AENCIC). AENCIC is a method that automatically estimates the best C needed by state-of-the-art clustering algorithms to segment an image, considering the image complexity perceived by humans. AENCIC was designed to work with fuzzy clustering algorithms employed to segment real-world images because this kind of segmentation is an ill-defined problem causing a high variation of C per image to attain a good segmentation. Results using the database BSDS500 demonstrate that using AENCIC to estimate C improves the performance of state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering image segmentation algorithms up to 94% of their ideal maximum performance, allowing those algorithms to work without human intervention.

ID PROTOCOL
AB For the design of the public-key exchange protocol, a chaos-based Triple-Layer Tree Parity Machine (TLTPM) directed group neural synchronization is presented in this study. For neural synchronization, a particular neural network structure called Tree Parity Machine (TPM) is utilized. Two TPMs take the same input but have distinct weight vectors, and update the weights using the neural learning algorithm by swapping output. It leads to perfect synchronization in certain phases, with the weights of the two TPMs becoming identical. The secret key is made up of these similar weights. However, there has not been much research on the randomness of the common input vector utilized in the synchronization process. A logistic chaotic system based on TLTPM is proposed in this paper. This proposed TLTPM model has several advantages like (1) leverages logistic chaos produced random common input vector for quicker synchronization. (2) With the same input, output, and hidden neurons, the suggested TLTPM model is quicker and more secure than TPM. (3) A binary tree framework considers each neural network as a node. (4) When the binary tree's i-th and j-th nodes are synchronized, one of these two nodes is chosen as the leader. (5) This leader node will now coordinate with the other branch's leader. After this procedure is completed, the coordinated weight has now become the cluster's session key. (6) And no need to synchronize each neural network in the group; rather, by coordinating between the elected leader nodes with just logarithmic synchronization steps, the whole group may share the same secret key. A variety of parametric tests have been performed on the suggested approach. The results were compared to some more contemporary methods. The suggested technique's findings have proven that it has both effective and resilient potential.

AB People have always longed for the virtual world, and the new information technology is also affecting the way people explore the virtual world. Since the emergence of VR technology, the form of entertainment has undergone tremendous changes. This technology has even penetrated into the film industry, causing some two-dimensional movies to be affected. At present, intelligent system technology is widely used in various industries, including aviation, aerospace, medical security, and other fields. These fields have relatively high security requirements for intelligent systems, and the requirements will become higher and higher in future. In order to have a better grasp of the security of the intelligent system, we modeled it and evaluated it through the model. In this research, we established a model of intelligent system by using computer language. This model mainly uses hierarchical modeling and proposes a method for reliability assessment of intelligent systems. In the process of implementation, we used Eclipse to design and formed a basic platform. We can evaluate the reliability of intelligent systems in a relatively short time on this platform, which is simpler than other methods and can save time. The validity of this study can be demonstrated by comparing the performance results with the expected results. Using this platform, we can quickly model and evaluate some instances, and visually display the results. At the same time, we also explored how two-dimensional animated films should change their style.

AB Interest in the subject of prediction has increased in recent years, and modern and advanced methods have emerged, including neural network models, chaotic algorithms, hybrid algorithms, and others. All of these methods are able to learn and self-adapt to any model and do not need assumptions for the nature of the time series. Taking more than one method may lead to an increase in the accuracy of future estimates, so a neural network and chaotic genetic algorithms are used, so a model combines the strengths of two techniques to develop a hybrid CGANN model to obtain more accurate prediction results and reduce prediction errors. The aim of this study is to shed light on some of the statistical methods used in predicting the future demand for electric power in the southern region, as well as pointing to the most accurate methods in predicting the future of energy. The annual electrical energy consumption data for the southern region were used to make a comparison through practical application, and it was found that the three methods are very high accuracy and suitable for use in the prediction process, but the most accurate models are the hybrid algorithm consisting of neural networks and the chaotic genetic algorithm CGANN that gives better and more results efficient and thus, was used to predict the electrical load of the southern region up to 2032.

AB In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of education quality evaluation and the reasonable allocation of educational resources, this paper proposes a novel education chain model based on the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm. The hybrid quantum neural network algorithm is a cutting-edge approach that combines the power of quantum computing with artificial neural networks, which are widely used in machine learning and data analysis. By leveraging the cloud model, the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm can be optimized for high performance and scalability, making it an ideal solution for complex data analysis and decision-making tasks in the education sector. Moreover, this paper applies the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm to solve the problem of flexible resource allocation in low-carbon supply chain management. By using the algorithm to analyze and optimize resource allocation, TN Travel Network can reduce carbon emissions and improve sustainability while also improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. Finally, this paper designs experiments to evaluate the model effect combined with mathematical statistics. The results show that the education chain model constructed in this paper has a significant effect on improving the efficiency and accuracy of education quality evaluation and the reasonable allocation of educational resources. By leveraging the power of the hybrid quantum neural network algorithm, TN Travel Network can achieve sustained growth and success in the education sector while also contributing to a more sustainable and low-carbon future.

AB Because of its own language characteristics, English has become the main language tool for communication among countries in the world under the global economic environment, and China is no exception. However, due to the constraints of the traditional education model, the English level of the population in China is generally low. The design and optimization of the English speech recognition system are a complex process that involves the integration of various technical components. In this paper, the main technical components of the system design are speech recognition and bat algorithm, which can complete the acquisition, training, and strengthening of target speech. The system will complete noise data elimination, acoustic model detection and recognition model construction, text training model, etc., during speech model training; the system will implement voice input detection, target feature extraction and matching, voice semantic recognition, etc., respectively, during speech recognition and acquisition. Experiments are designed to test the performance of the system. The results show that the recognition rate of the system is high, reaching 90%, but the initial vocabulary is negatively correlated with the recognition rate. In general, the system design meets the target requirements and can better complete the identification task. The use of English speech recognition system can enable learners to have a more perfect oral learning environment, give full play to the role of language interaction, and improve their learning effectiveness and enthusiasm. In this paper, the bat algorithm is introduced into the field of English speech recognition to develop an effective recognition system.

AB Constipation is a clinical gastrointestinal disease or a digestive disorder treated mostly by Western medicine. However, the therapeutic impact is frequently insufficient due to medication resistance or problems such as electrolyte imbalance. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is another alternative for avoiding and treating constipation. It is not only alleviating constipation but also effectively prevents and treats illness consequences by regulating visceral processes. However, its clinical efficacy and mechanism need to be further studied with promising machine learning (ML)-based prediction techniques. Therefore, by using meta-analysis method and ML predictions methods, the study has evaluated the implications of the Jichuan decoction treating constipation. By exploring databases such as CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), The Cochrane Library, Ovid and Embase, this predictive analysis has been performed. These databases include all the randomized controlled studies focused on Jichuan decoction to treat constipation, and the outcomes have been observed by collecting information from authentic resources. All the published articles on the study of Jichuan decoction have been screened, and the quality of the final selected articles has been assessed by the Cochrane ROB tool (version 5.1). The data including the total effective rate, recurrence rate, and total score of symptoms and adverse reactions of Jichuan decoction are analyzed by RevMan 5.4. The results are analyzed using data analytic tools where sample of 26 RCT studies is finally included with 2329 cases. The ML-based predictors (Ridge algorithm, AdaBoost and hybrid approach) are used to infer the results. Compared with the conventional treatment methods, Jichuan decoction significantly reduces the rate of constipation and also reduces the recurrence rate. In the subject group, the total score of symptoms is remarkably higher when compared with the control group. The occurrence rate of adverse effects is significantly lowered down by using Jichuan decoction. It is concluded from the research study that Jichuan decoction is effective in treating constipation.

AB English video teaching is an indispensable part of English teaching, but there are certain difficulties in the design of English video courses, which need to be guided by artificial intelligence methods. Based on machine learning algorithm and Sobel algorithm, this paper builds an English video classroom design platform, uses image technology to process video, and proposes an improved algorithm based on Sobel operator. Moreover, this paper uses Sobel horizontal and vertical detection operators to define the edge strength of the block to be repaired and introduces a weight factor to enable the improved algorithm to repair images with different texture levels. In addition, this article improves the original SSD by introducing STD based on the image standard deviation and uses the degree of gray value dispersion between image blocks as a criterion for comparing whether two image blocks are similar, which effectively improves the accuracy of the search strategy. The experimental results show that the algorithm constructed in this paper can play a certain effect in teaching.

AB In the late twentieth century, the combination of computer technology and high-resolution image processing technology brought unprecedented changes to today's society, giving birth to a series of new industrial technologies. By utilizing various technologies such as computer design, correction, storage, and recognition, we can effectively process and change images, and virtual reality technology is an effective tool to achieve this goal. It can help us better understand high-resolution images, thereby achieving more efficient and accurate image processing designs. Since ancient times, rural landscapes have always been a key carrier of Chinese landscape culture and art. However, in the era of reform and opening up economic development, culture and aesthetics have gradually declined and broken on the vast rural land. In recent years, the implementation of the "rural revitalization" strategy has provided a valuable opportunity for rural landscape planning, ecological environment improvement and beautiful rural construction, which has been strongly supported by the government. In this context, the principles of rural landscape norms are systematically summarized. By analyzing the landscape basis of rural landscape planning norms, it is extremely urgent for rural landscape construction to get scientific and efficient technical support and mature and standardized planning theory guidance. In view of the above problems, virtual reality technology and high-resolution image processing technology are introduced, and its excellent spatial analysis function is applied to the simulation of the effect of rural landscape norms, and scientific and comprehensive technical analysis is used as the basis for decision-making.

AB In order to improve the background separation effect of athletes, guided by the idea of machine learning algorithms, this paper uses the skeleton segmentation algorithm as the basis to construct an artificial intelligence model for background separation of sports athletes. Moreover, this paper describes the movement of the human body through the human skeleton composed of bone joint points and bones, and realizes the understanding of human behavior through the movement analysis of the bone joints and the activity recognition of the overall skeleton. In addition, in response to the self-occlusion problem that occurs during human movement, this paper proposes a human skeleton extraction algorithm framework with a multilayer network algorithm as the core. The model was trained on the dataset using a deep learning algorithm, which enabled it to learn and recognize patterns and features in the images. The model was then tested on a separate set of images to evaluate its performance. The results of the experiment showed that the model was able to effectively separate athletes from the image background with high accuracy, and accurately identify their sports characteristics, such as body position, movement, and equipment. By accurately identifying sports characteristics, the model can provide coaches and athletes with valuable insights into their performance, helping them to identify areas for improvement and optimize their training and performance strategies.

AB Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool in prostate lesion assessment. However, training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) inevitably involves magnetic resonance (MR) images from multiple cohorts. There always exists variation in scanning protocol among cohorts, inducing significant changes in data distribution between source and target domains. This challenge has greatly limited clinical adoption on a large scale. Herein, a coarse mask-guided deep domain adaptation network (CMD(2)A-Net) is proposed to develop a fully automated framework for prostate lesion detection and classification (PLDC). No category or mask label is required from the target domain. A coarse segmentation module is trained to cover the possible lesion-related regions, so that attention maps can be generated to dedicate the local feature extraction of lesions within those regions. Experiments are performed on 512 mpMRI sets from datasets of PROSTATEx (330 sets) and two cohorts, A (74 sets) and B (108 sets). Using ensemble learning, CMD(2)A-Net accomplishes an AUC of 0.921 in cohort A and 0.913 in cohort B, demonstrating its transferability from a large-scale public dataset PROSTATEx to small-scale target domains. Results from an ablation study also support its effectiveness in classification between benign and malignant lesions, compared to the state-of-the-art models.

AB A widely utilized tool in reactor analysis is passive tracers that report the residence time distribution, allowing estimation of the conversion and other properties of the system. Recently, advances in microrobotics have introduced powered and functional entities with sizes comparable to some traditional tracers. This has motivated the concept of Smart Tracers that could record the local chemical concentrations, temperature, or other conditions as they progress through reactors. Herein, the design constraints and advantages of Smart Tracers by simulating their operation in a laminar flow reactor model conducting chemical reactions of various orders are analyzed. It is noted that far fewer particles are necessary to completely map even the most complex concentration gradients compared with their conventional counterparts. Design criteria explored herein include sampling frequency, memory storage capacity, and ensemble number necessary to achieve the required accuracy to inform a reactor model. Cases of severe particle diffusion and sensor noise appear to bind the functional upper limit of such probes and require consideration for future design. The results of the study provide a starting framework for applying the new technology of microrobotics to the broad and impactful set of problems classified as chemical reactor analysis.

AB In this paper, we describe the challenges of collecting data in the Maori population for automatic detection of schizophrenia using natural language processing (NLP). Existing psychometric tools for detecting are wide ranging and do not meet the health needs of indigenous persons considered at risk of developing psychosis and/or schizophrenia. Automated methods using NLP have been developed to detect psychosis and schizophrenia but lack cultural nuance in their designs. Research incorporating the cultural aspects relevant to indigenous communities is lacking in the design of existing automatic prediction tools and one of the main reasons is the scarcity of data from indigenous populations. This paper explores the current design of the New Zealand health care system and its potential impacts on access and inequities in the Maori population and details the methodology used to collect speech samples of Maori at risk of developing psychosis and schizophrenia. The paper also describes the major obstacles faced during speech data collection, key findings, and probable solutions.

TI Path-guided intelligent switching over knowledge graphs with deep
   reinforcement learning for recommendation
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

   Intelligent path-switching
AB Online recommendation systems process large amounts of information to make personalized recommendations. There has been some progress in research on incorporating knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning for recommendation; however, some challenges still remain. First, in these approaches, an agent cannot switch paths intelligently, because of which, the agent cannot cope with multi-entities and multi-relations in knowledge graphs. Second, these methods do not have predefined targets and thus cannot discover items that are closely related to user-interacted items and latent rich semantic relationships. Third, contemporary methods do not consider long rational paths in knowledge graphs. To address these problems, we propose a deep knowledge reinforcement learning (DKRL) framework, in which path-guided intelligent switching was implemented over knowledge graphs incorporating reinforcement learning; this model integrates predefined target and long logic paths over knowledge graphs for recommendation systems. Specifically, the designed novel path-based intelligent switching algorithm with predefined target enables an agent to switch paths intelligently among multi-entities and multi-relations over knowledge graphs. In addition, the weight of each path is calculated, and the agent switches paths between multiple entities according to path weights. Furthermore, the long logic path has better recommendation performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments with actual data demonstrate that our work improves upon existing methods.The experimental results indicated that DKRL improved the baselines of NDCG@10 by 3.7%, 9.3%, and 4.7%; of HR@10 by 12.39%, 20.8%, and 13.86%; of Prec@10 by 5.17%, 3.57%, 6.2%; of Recall@10 by 3.01%, 4.2%, and 3.37%. The DKRL model achieved more effective recommendation performance using several large benchmark data sets compared with other advanced methods.

ID MODEL
AB Rockburst is one of the common geological disasters in deep underground areas with high stress. Rockburst prediction is an important measure to know in advance the risk of rockburst hazards to take a scientific approach to the response. In view of the fuzziness and uncertainty between quantitative indexes and qualitative grade assessments in prediction, this study proposes the use of a normal cloud model to optimize the theory of unascertained measures (NC-UM). The uniaxial compressive strength (& sigma;(c)), stress coefficient (& sigma;(& theta;)/& sigma;(c)), elastic deformation energy index (Wet), and brittleness index of rock (& sigma;(c)/& sigma;(t)) are selected as the index of prediction. After data screening, 249 groups of rockburst case data are selected as the original data set. To reduce the influence of subjective and objective factors of index weight on the prediction results, the game theory is used to synthesize the three weighting methods of Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC), Entropy Weight (EW), and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to obtain the comprehensive weight of the index. After validating the model with example data, the results showed that the model was 93.3% accurate with no more than one level of prediction deviation. Compared with the traditional unascertained measure (UM) rockburst prediction model, the accuracy is 15-20% higher than that of the traditional model. It shows that the model is valid and applicable in predicting the rockburst propensity level.

However, the static transformation mechanisms cannot separate interactive decision variables, whereas the random transformation mechanisms encounter low efficiency. To tackle these issues, this paper suggests a decision-variable-contribution-based adaptive evolutionary cloud workflow scheduling approach (VCAES for short). To be specific, the VCAES includes a new estimation method to quantify the contribution of each decision variable to the population advancement in terms of both convergence and diversity, and dynamically classifies the decision variables according to their contributions during the previous iterations. Moreover, the VCAES includes a mechanism to adaptively allocate evolution opportunities to each constructed group of decision variables. Thus, the decision variables with a strong impact on population advancement are assigned more evolution opportunities to accelerate population to approximate the Pareto-optimal fronts. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed VCAES, we carry out extensive numerical experiments on real-world workflows and cloud platforms to compare it with four representative algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the VCAES in resolving cloud workflow scheduling problems.

AB The external calibration between 3D LiDAR and 2D camera is an extremely important step towards multimodal fusion for robot perception. However, its accuracy is still unsatisfactory. To improve the accuracy of calibration, we first analyze the interference factors that affect the performance of the calibration model under a causal inference framework in this study. Guided by the causality analysis, we present Iter-CalibNet (Iterative Calibration Convolutional Neural Network) to infer a 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) rigid body transformation between 3D LiDAR and 2D camera. By downscaling point clouds to obtain more overlapping region between 3D-2D data pair and applying iterative calibration manner, the interference of confounding bias in the calibration model is effectively eliminated. Moreover, our Iter-CalibNet adds non-local neural network after each convolution operation to capture the transformation relationship. We also combine the geometric loss and photometric loss obtained from the interframe constraints to optimize the calibration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Iter-CalibNet can achieve leading performance by comparison with other CNN based and traditional calibration methods.

AB Autonomous exploration is a critical technology to realize robotic intelligence as it allows unsupervised preparation for future tasks and facilitates flexible deployment. In this paper, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based autonomous exploration strategy is proposed to efficiently reduce the unknown area of the workspace and provide accurate 2D map construction for mobile robots. Different from existing human-designed exploration techniques that usually make strong assumptions about the scenarios and the tasks, we utilize a model-free method to directly learn an exploration strategy through trial-and-error interactions with complex environments. To be specific, the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD) is first utilized for domain conversion to obtain a high-dimensional Topological Environmental Representation (TER). Then, the Generalized Voronoi Networks (GVN) with spatial awareness and episodic memory is designed to learn autonomous exploration policies interactively online. For complete and efficient exploration, Invalid Action Masking (IAM) is employed to reshape the configuration space of exploration tasks to cope with the explosion of action space and observation space caused by the expansion of the exploration range. Furthermore, a well-designed reward function is leveraged to guide the learning of policies. Extensive baseline tests and comparative simulations show that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art strategies in terms of map quality and exploration speed. Sufficient ablation studies and mobile robot experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our strategy.

AB Multichannel, audio processing approaches are widely examined in human-computer interaction, autonomous robots, audio surveillance, and teleconferencing systems. The numerous applications are linked to the speech technology and acoustic analysis area. Much attention is received to the active speakers and spatial localization of acoustic sources on the acoustic sensor arrays. Baseline approaches provide negotiable performance in a real-world comprised of far-field/near-field monitoring, reverberant and noisy environments, and also the outdoor/indoor scenarios. A practical system to detect defects in complex structures is the time difference mapping (TDM) technique. The significant scope of the research is to search the location using the minimum distance point in the time difference database to be apart from the verification point. In the case of the improved "time difference mapping (I-TDM)" technique and traditional "time difference mapping (T-TDM)" technique, the denser grids and vast database permit increased accuracy. In the database, if the location points are not present, then the accurate localization of the I-TDM and T-TDM techniques is damaged. Hence, to handle these problems, this article plans to develop acoustic source localization according to the deep learning strategy. The audio dataset is gathered from the benchmark source called the SSLR dataset and is initially subjected to preprocessing, which involves artifact removal and smoothing for effective processing. Further, the adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based feature set creation is performed. Here, the adaptive CNN is accomplished by the improved optimization algorithm called distance mating-based red deer algorithm (DM-RDA). With this trained feature set, the acoustic source localization is done by the weight updated deep neural network, in which the same DM-RDA is used for optimizing the training weight. The simulation outcome proves that the designed model produced enhanced performance compared to other traditional source localization estimators.

AB Given a graph whose edges are assigned positive-type and negative-type weights, the problem of correlation clustering aims at grouping the graph vertices so as to minimize (resp. maximize) the sum of negative-type (resp. positive-type) intra-cluster weights plus the sum of positive-type (resp. negative-type) inter-cluster weights. In correlation clustering, it is typically assumed that the weights are readily available. This is a rather strong hypothesis, which is unrealistic in several scenarios. To overcome this limitation, in this work we focus on the setting where edge weights of a correlation-clustering instance are unknown, and they have to be estimated in multiple rounds, while performing the clustering. The clustering solutions produced in the various rounds provide a feedback to properly adjust the weight estimates, and the goal is to maximize the cumulative quality of the clusterings. We tackle this problem by resorting to the reinforcement-learning paradigm, and, specifically, we design for the first time a Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) framework for correlation clustering. We provide a variety of contributions, namely (1) formulations of the minimization and maximization variants of correlation clustering in a CMAB setting; (2) adaptation of well-established CMAB algorithms to the correlation-clustering context; (3) regret analyses to theoretically bound the accuracy of these algorithms; (4) design of further (heuristic) algorithms to have the probability constraint satisfied at every round (key condition to soundly adopt efficient yet effective algorithms for correlation clustering as CMAB oracles); (5) extensive experimental comparison among a variety of both CMAB and non-CMAB approaches for correlation clustering.

AB Neural architecture search (NAS) proves to be among the effective approaches for many tasks by generating an application-adaptive neural architecture, which is still challenged by high computational cost and memory consumption. At the same time, 1-bit convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with binary weights and activations show their potential for resource-limited embedded devices. One natural approach is to use 1-bit CNNs to reduce the computation and memory cost of NAS by taking advantage of the strengths of each in a unified framework, while searching the 1-bit CNNs is more challenging due to the more complicated processes involved. In this paper, we introduce Discrepant Child-Parent Neural Architecture Search (DCP-NAS) to efficiently search 1-bit CNNs, based on a new framework of searching the 1-bit model (Child) under the supervision of a real-valued model (Parent). Particularly, we first utilize a Parent model to calculate a tangent direction, based on which the tangent propagation method is introduced to search the optimized 1-bit Child. We further observe a coupling relationship between the weights and architecture parameters existing in such differentiable frameworks. To address the issue, we propose a decoupled optimization method to search an optimized architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DCP-NAS achieves much better results than prior arts on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In particular, the backbones achieved by our DCP-NAS achieve strong generalization performance on person re-identification and object detection.

AB The main aim of this article is to hybridize orthogonal experimental design (OED) in different population-based metaheuristics to make them more suitable for structural optimization problems. OED is an efficient statistics method that can predict the optimal combination of a multi-level multi-factor problem with far fewer experiments. The motivation of the current study is to design different guidance (transmission) vectors that can efficiently utilize the search information of a couple of candidate solutions and thus balance the exploration/exploitation capabilities of optimization algorithms. Furthermore, by using this method, the convergence speed and accuracy of the final results are enhanced. Four well-known metaheuristics are selected to strengthen their performance by integrating learning strategies based on OED, known as orthogonal learning (OL), in them, and their viability was validated on a set of benchmark structural optimization problems. The performances of the enhanced metaheuristics are compared with each other and their standard versions. The results are discussed based on accuracy, convergence rate, robustness, and diversity index. Furthermore, the Friedman test is utilized to rank different scenarios to investigate the best one. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the OL to improve the metaheuristics in comparison with their basic versions and show that OL scenarios are an especially useful tool to strengthen the potency of the algorithms for the most complicated structural optimization problems.

AB Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside coconuts, famous for rehydrating after exercise or while suffering from a minor sickness. The essential issue tackled in this paper is how to estimate the appropriate stage of maturity of coconut water, which is a time-consuming task in the beverage industry since, as the coconut age increases, the coconut water flavor varies. Accordingly, to handle this issue, an adaptive model based on Fuzzy Neural Network and Sperm Whale Optimization, dubbed FNN-SWO, is developed to assess coconut water maturity. The Sperm Whale Optimization (SWO) algorithm is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm. It is embedded in this model along with neural networks and fuzzy techniques (FNN system), which can be employed as an essential building block in the beverage industry. The proposed FNN-SWO model is trained and tested utilizing fuzzy rules with an adaptive network. In contrast, the SWO algorithm is adopted to determine the optimal weights for the fuzzy rules. Three subsets of data divided according to three levels of coconut water maturity-tender, mature, and very mature, are used to validate the combined FNN-SWO model. Depending on these three subsets of data, a comparison of the proposed FNN-SWO model has been conducted against a set of the most common conventional techniques. These techniques include Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, FNN, Artificial Neural Network, as well as their embedding with other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. For various key performance indicators, such as recall, F1-score, specificity, and accuracy, the proposed FNN-SWO model provides the best prediction outcomes compared to the current time-consuming techniques. The dominance of the proposed FNN-SWO model is evident from the final findings compared to its time-consuming peers for estimating coconut water maturity on time. As a result, the proposed FNN-SWO model is an effective heuristic for locating optimal solutions to classification problems. It can thereby be reassuringly applicable to other similar prediction problems. Additionally, it would benefit the scientific community interested in evaluating coconut water.

AB The performances of aircraft braking control systems are strongly influenced by the tire friction force experienced during the braking phase. The availability of an accurate estimate of the current airstrip characteristics is a recognized issue for developing optimized braking control schemes. The study presented in this paper is focused on the robust online estimation of the airstrip characteristics from sensory data usually available on an aircraft. In order to capture the nonlinear dependency of the current best slip on sequential slip-friction measurements acquired during the braking maneuver, multilayer perceptron (MLP) approximators have been proposed. The MLP training is based on a synthetic data set derived from a widely used tire-road friction model. In order to achieve robust predictions, MLP architectures based on the drop-out mechanism have been applied not only in the offline training phase but also during the braking. This allowed to online compute a confidence interval measure for best friction estimate that has been exploited to refine the estimation via Kalman Filtering. Open loop and closed loop simulation studies in 15 representative airstrip scenarios (with multiple surface transitions) have been performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed robust estimation method in terms of estimation error, aircraft braking distance, and time, together with a quantitative comparison with a state-of-the-art benchmark approach.

DT Article; Early Access

   tasks learning; Object occlusion
AB Although two-stage methods of instance segmentation achieve better performance than one-stage counterparts, the segmentation results on overlapping objects are unsatisfactory. We found that occlusion significantly impacts the location of adjacent objects and produces coarse masks without adequate refinements. To circumvent the issue, we propose a hybrid model for instance segmentation called HTCIS, which iteratively forms the detection and segmentation. The main idea is to improve overall performance by optimizing every component based on a two-stage cascade structure. Compared with existing models, our approach decreases the loss of feature information, including semantic and detailed features. The detection branch prioritizes location accuracy when ranking bounding boxes, while the segmentation branch explores more contextual information and segments pixels in a multi-view fashion with the guide of an attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that HTCIS is capable of processing occlusion. We conclude that multi-refinement of two-stage cascade is essential for accurate segmentation of overlapping objects, and our optimization is efficient in achieving this goal.

AB Self-supervised learning has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on various anomaly detection tasks. Learning effective representations by solving a supervised pretext task with pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data provides a promising concept for industrial downstream tasks such as process monitoring. In this paper, we present SSMSPC a novel approach for multivariate statistical in-process control (MSPC) based on self-supervised learning. Our motivation for SSMSPC is to leverage the potential of unsupervised representation learning by incorporating self-supervised learning into the general statistical process control (SPC) framework to develop a holistic approach for the detection and localization of anomalous process behavior in discrete manufacturing processes. We propose a pretext task called Location + Transformation prediction, where the objective is to classify both, the type and the location of a randomly applied augmentation on a given time series input. In the downstream task, we follow the one-class classification setting and apply the Hotelling's T-2 statistic on the learned representations. We further propose an extension to the control chart view that combines metadata with the learned representations to visualize the anomalous time steps in the process data which supports a machine operator in the root cause analysis. We evaluate the effectiveness of SSMSPC with two real-world CNC-milling datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches, achieving 100% and 99.6% AUROC, respectively. Lastly, we deploy SSMSPC at a CNC-milling machine to demonstrate its practical applicability when used as a process monitoring tool in a running process.

DE Named entity; Named entity recognition; Linguistic features; Morphology;

AB In this paper, we propose a novel way of improving named entity recognition (NER) in the Korean language using its language-specific features. While the field of NER has been studied extensively in recent years, the mechanism of efficiently recognizing named entities (NEs) in Korean has hardly been explored. This is because the Korean language has distinct linguistic properties that present challenges for modeling. Therefore, an annotation scheme for Korean corpora by adopting the CoNLL-U format, which decomposes Korean words into morphemes and reduces the ambiguity of NEs in the original segmentation that may contain functional morphemes such as postpositions and particles, is proposed herein. We investigate how the NE tags are best represented in this morpheme-based scheme and implement an algorithm to convert word-based and syllable-based Korean corpora with NEs into the proposed morpheme-based format. Analyses of the results of traditional and neural models reveal that the proposed morpheme-based format is feasible, and the varied performances of the models under the influence of various additional language-specific features are demonstrated. Extrinsic conditions were also considered to observe the variance of the performances of the proposed models, given different types of data, including the original segmentation and different types of tagging formats.

DE Interval analysis; Neural network robustness; Adversarial example;
   Inclusion isotonicity; Lipschitzian property
AB Neural networks are widely deployed in many scenarios and have reached or exceeded human-level performance in some tasks. However, the researchers found that existing neural networks are vulnerable to attacks. One of the cases is that the network outputs the wrong result in the presence of small perturbations in the input. It indicates that the neural network does not meet the robustness. Neural networks, which do not meet robustness, will limit their application in safety-critical systems such as automatic driving and wise medical. Hence, the research on the robustness of neural networks is significant. Interval analysis is a mathematical technique used to put bounds on rounding errors and measurement errors in mathematical computation and can be used to calculate the exact output range of a real-valued function. Based on the theoretical framework of interval analysis, we define the interval extension of neural networks and prove that it includes the inclusion isotonicity and Lipschitzian property. It illustrates the feasibility of using interval extension to compute the output range of a neural network corresponding to a given input range. In order to evaluate the robustness of the neural network, we further analyze the characteristics of the neural network interval extension and design a neural network robustness evaluation method based on the greedy strategy. Experiment results on the MNIST and ACAS Xu datasets show that the method can effectively evaluate the robustness of the neural network with good time performance.

AB For the success of a software project, early and precise discrimination of software requirement risks are essential. Researchers have suggested several predictive methods based on conventional deep learning techniques, but the common factor is the high misclassification rate. Setting the appropriate hyperparameters is a complex problem in deep learning. Manual, grid and random searches are the most common methods for locating the best deep neural network hyperparameters. However, these are not the choice when experience is lacking. In this article, we proposed Deep Neural Network with Memetic firefly. The deep neural network performs classification tasks, and deep neural network hyperparameters have been optimized using a memetic firefly algorithm. Moreover, a novel perturbation operator is introduced to get rid of locally optimal solutions of the traditional firefly algorithm. The proposed method's performance has been validated by comparing various hybrid techniques such as a deep neural network with firefly hill-climbing, a deep neural network with firefly, a deep neural network with PSO, and a deep neural network to identify the risk in software requirements. The proposed deep neural network with the memetic firefly algorithm outperforms all compared approaches with a 98.8% accuracy. It is adaptable for accurate software risk prediction in projects.

AB With the explosive growth of music volume, music recommendation systems have become an important tool for online music platforms to alleviate the information overload problem. Through the use of deep learning, the multi-information fusion-based deep recommendation method has gained popularity in the field of music recommendation systems research. However, most existing studies only consider the different kinds of information of users or music and fail to capture information's internal and external associations. In this work, we propose a hierarchical multi-information fusion method for deep music recommendation (MMusic), to fully exploit the features of each type of information and to better learn the representation of users and music. Specifically, combined with the features of music recommendation, we identify various kinds of information describing users and music, respectively. Then, we learn about the interactions within and between different kinds of information for fusion. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available dataset NOWPLAYINGRS. The results show that MMusic achieves the best performance compared with the baselines, which verifies the effectiveness and rationality of our model.

AB The emergence of the HotpotQA dataset addressed the lack of training datasets on multi-hop question answering. Based on the strengths of this dataset, we proposed a novel model applicable to multi-hop question answering, called it ELECTRA-based Graph Network model (EGN). First, the method was able to correlate questions with contextual paragraphs and external Wikipedia data to naturally obtain next-hop connected paragraph, initialized the text data with a pre-trained context encoder, Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Re-placements Accurately (ELECTRA). Second, it iterated and updated text features at different levels with the modified Graph Attention Network (GATv2) network. EGN was able to achieve a comparable result in less time with the iterative computation of GATv2 by linking more sensible clues and using ELECTRA to obtain a better representation of the data. In the experiments, EGN performed well with the FullWiki setting on the HotpotQA validation dataset, achieving a Joint EM/F1 score of 47.35/74.62 on the validation set.

The proposed aggregation volume estimator based on a magnetic drug-targeting simulator reflects volume changes of aggregated MNPs; hence, it can model a magnetic force acting on aggregated MNPs in real time while enhancing targeting performance. The proposed guidance system is evaluated using a simulation testbed and in vitro model of the rat brain, which yields comparable results at different fluid viscosities, flow velocities, target areas, and flow types. The OLPG with the aggregation volume estimator improves targeting performance by 116%-409% compared with the default mode, and by 111%-180% compared to the performance without the aggregation volume estimator. Furthermore, a guidance margin predicts enhanced targeting performance (root-mean-square error < 5%) irrespective of the flow environment. The proposed guidance strategy has the potential to overcome the problems caused by the lack of an imaging modality, control-system complexity, and low targeting performance.

AB Stress is a universally ubiquitous emotional state that takes place everywhere and microgestures (MGs) have been verified to indicate more accurate hidden emotions. However, only limited studies attempted to explore how MGs could reflect stress levels. Herein, EmoSense, an emerging technology for wearable systems containing a three-layer stress detection mechanism, is proposed: 1) converting the MGs into digital signals; 2) training a machine learning-based MG detection model; and 3) configuring the stress level based on the MG frequency. To detect the MGs, the swept frequency capacitive sensing technology to is adopted capture the MG signals and the random forest model to detect the MGs effectively is applied. 16 participants are recruited in the pilot study to verify the correlation between stress level and MG frequency. The experimental results further verify that stress level is highly related to other negative emotions that should be studied while handling high stress levels.

AB Herein, physical reservoir computing with a redox-based ion-gating reservoir (redox-IGR) comprising LixWO3 thin film and lithium-ion conducting glass ceramic (LICGC) is demonstrated. The subject redox-IGR successfully solves a second-order nonlinear dynamic equation by utilizing voltage pulse driven ion-gating in a LixWO3 channel to enable reservoir computing. Under the normal conditions, in which only the drain current (I-D) is used for the reservoir states, the lowest prediction error is 8.15 x 10(-4). Performance is enhanced by the addition of I-G to the reservoir states, resulting in a significant lowering of the prediction error to 5.39 x 10(-4), which is noticeably lower than other types of physical reservoirs (memristors and spin torque oscillators) reported to date. A second-order nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA2) task, a typical benchmark of reservoir computing, is also performed with the IGR and good performance is achieved, with a normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 0.163. A short-term memory task is performed to investigate an enhancement mechanism resulting from the I-G addition. An increase in memory capacity, from 2.35 without I-G to 3.57 with I-G, is observed in the forgetting curves, indicating that enhancement of both high dimensionality and memory capacity is attributed to the origin of the performance improvement.

AB Anticipatory thinking is necessary for managing risk in the safety- and mission-critical domains where AI systems are being deployed. We analyze the intersection of anticipatory thinking, the optimization paradigm, and metaforesight to advance our understanding of AI systems and their adaptive capabilities when encountering low-likelihood/high-impact risks. We describe this intersection as the anticipatory paradigm. We detail these challenges in concrete examples and propose new types of anticipatory thinking, towards a paradigm shift in how AI systems are evaluated.

AB Infrared imaging is widely used due to its penetration capability to operate under many weather or lighting condition. However, due to the far distance of aerial view, feature blur, and the scarcity of aerial infrared data, the detection of small infrared targets on the water surface remains a challenging problem. In response to the problem of unclear features, we propose the spatial feature weighting method based on 2D Gaussian distribution. This method increases the weight of the target area by adaptively adjusting the feature activation. Secondly, for the problem of rare aerial perspective infrared data, we propose the cross-spectral data migration method. By introducing the domain difference loss function to optimize the pseudo-label selection process, the range of target domain distribution is expanded, and the adaptability of the detector is improved. Finally, in response to the problem of underfitting caused by category imbalance in transfer learning, we propose the class balancing method that effectively reduces the false detection. Extensive experiments were conducted on both benchmark datasets and the self-built dataset to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The proposed method was evaluated with different models and various scenarios, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness.

AB Accurate segmentation of brain gliomas (BG) is a crucial and challenging task for effective treatment planning in BG therapy. This study presents the weight loss function and dropout U-Net with ConvNeXt block (WD-UNeXt), which precisely segments BG from few shot MRI. The ConvNeXt block, which comprises the main body of the network, is a structure that can extract more detailed features from images. The weight loss function addresses the issue of category imbalance, thereby enhancing the network's ability to achieve more precise segmentation. The training set of BraTS2019 was used to train the network and apply it to test data. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spec) and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to assess the performance of the method. The experimental results demonstrate that the DSC of whole tumour, tumour core and enhancing tumour reached 0.934, 0.911 and 0.851, respectively. Sen of the sub-regions achieved 0.922, 0.911 and 0.867. Spec and HD reached 1.000, 1.000, 1.000 and 3.224, 2.990, 2.844, respectively. Compared with the performance of state-of-the-art methods, the DSC and HD of WD-UNeXt were improved to varying degrees. Therefore, this method has considerable potential for the segmentation of BG.

ID IRONY; MODEL
AB Sarcasm is a prevailing rhetorical device that intentionally uses words that literally meaning opposite the real meaning. Due to this deliberate ambiguity, accurately detecting sarcasm can encourage the comprehension of users' real intentions. Therefore, sarcasm detection is a critical and challenging task for sentiment analysis. In previous research, neural network-based models are generally unsatisfactory when dealing with complex sarcastic expressions. To ameliorate this situation, we propose a multi-perspective contrastive learning framework for sarcasm detection, called SLGC, which is guided by sememe knowledge and label information based on the pre-trained neural model. For the in-instance perspective, we leverage the sememe, the minimum meaning unit, to guide the contrastive learning to produce high-quality sentence representations. For the between-instance perspective, we utilize label information to guide contrastive learning to mine potential interaction relationships between sarcastic expressions. Experiments on two public benchmark sarcasm detection dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art model.

   Adaptive model repair
AB Recently, convolutional neural networks have been shown to be sensitive to artificially designed perturbations that are imperceptible to the naked eye. Whether it is image classification, semantic segmentation, or object detection, all of them will face such problem. The existence of adversarial examples raises questions about the security of smart applications. Some works have paid attention to this problem and proposed several defensive strategies to resist adversarial attacks. However, no one explored the vulnerable area of the model under multiple attacks. In this work, we fill this gap by exploring the vulnerable areas of the model, which is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Specifically, under various attack methods with different strengths, we conduct extensive experiments on two datasets based on three different networks and illustrate some phenomena. Besides, by exploiting the Siamese Network, we propose a novel approach to more intuitively discover the deficiencies of the model. Moreover, we further provide a novel adaptive vulnerable point repair method to improve the adversarial robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method can effectively improve the adversarial robustness of the model.

AB Model synchronization refers to the communication process involved in large-scale distributed machine learning tasks. As the cluster scales up, the synchronization of model parameters becomes a challenging task that has to be coordinated among thousands of workers. Firstly, this study proposes a hierarchical AllReduce algorithm structured on a two-dimensional torus (2D-THA), which utilizes a hierarchical structure to synchronize model parameters and maximize bandwidth utilization. Secondly, this study introduces a distributed consensus algorithm called 2D-THA-ADMM, which combines the 2D-THA synchronization algorithm with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Thirdly, we evaluate the model parameter synchronization performance of 2D-THA and the scalability of 2D-THA-ADMM on the Tianhe-2 supercomputing platform using real public datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that 2D-THA significantly reduces synchronization time by 63.447% compared to MPI_Allreduce. Furthermore, the proposed 2D-THA-ADMM algorithm exhibits excellent scalability, with a training speed increase of over 3 x compared to the state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining high accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB A reliable Decision Support System (DSS), particularly in the construction domain, can be driven by quality input information. Although vision-based methods have been widely utilized to retrieve contextual information, their potential is not fully leveraged in construction simulation yet. This study introduces an automated framework that utilizes multi-view video footage for vision-based input modeling within simulation domains. The proposed framework addresses project uncertainties (e.g., equipment performance, operators' skills, road network, and weather status) using a proactive approach where project task durations are modeled as probabilistic distributions. The modeled distributions are continuously calibrated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Inference (MCMCBI) approach. A simulation-based Simulated Annealing (SA) optimization is also employed to provide an efficient resource assignment. The extracted vision-based data is validated statistically against actual and spatiotemporal data. The results demonstrate that the suggested vision-based approach can provide qualified DSS input. Statistical analysis also confirms that vision-based data is more consistent with actual data than spatiotemporal data. The presented approach is successfully applied to an actual case study of a large-scale earthmoving project.

DE Federated learning; Client clustering; Contrastive learning;
   Pre-training; Data heterogeneity
AB Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach that enables distributed clients to collaboratively train a global model while preserving their data privacy. However, FL often suffers from data heterogeneity problems, which can significantly affect its performance. To address this, clustered federated learning (CFL) has been proposed to construct personalized models for different client clusters. One effective client clustering strategy is to allow clients to choose their own local models from a model pool based on their performance. However, without pre-trained model parameters, such a strategy is prone to clustering failure, in which all clients choose the same model. Unfortunately, collecting a large amount of labeled data for pre-training can be costly and impractical in distributed environments. To overcome this challenge, we leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit unlabeled data for the pre-training of FL systems. Together, self-supervised pre-training and client clustering can be crucial components for tackling the data heterogeneity issues of FL. Leveraging these two crucial strategies, we propose contrastive pre-training-based clustered federated learning (CP-CFL) to improve the model convergence and overall performance of FL systems. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CP-CFL through extensive experiments in heterogeneous FL settings, and present various interesting observations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Deep neural networks have been found vulnerable to adversarial attacks, thus raising potential concerns in security-sensitive contexts. To address this problem, recent research has investigated the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks from the architectural point of view. However, searching for architectures of deep neural networks is computationally expensive, particularly when coupled with an adversarial training process. To meet the above challenge, this paper proposes a bi-fidelity multiobjective neural architecture search approach. First, we formulate the neural architecture search (NAS) problem for enhancing the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks into a multiobjective optimization problem. Specifically, in addition to using low-fidelity estimations as the primary objectives, we leverage the output of a surrogate model trained with high-fidelity evaluations as an auxiliary objective. Secondly, we reduce the computational cost by combining three performance estimation methods, i.e., parameter sharing, low-fidelity evaluation, and surrogate-based predictor. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is confirmed by extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, there has been a growing interest for mixed-categorical meta-models based on Gaussian pro-cess (GP) surrogates. In this setting, several existing approaches use different strategies either by using continuous kernels (e.g., continuous relaxation and Gower distance based GP) or by using a direct estima-tion of the correlation matrix. In this paper, we present a kernel-based approach that extends continuous exponential kernels to handle mixed-categorical variables. The proposed kernel leads to a new GP surro-gate that generalizes both the continuous relaxation and the Gower distance based GP models. We demonstrate, on both analytical and engineering problems, that our proposed GP model gives a higher likelihood and a smaller residual error than the other kernel-based state-of-the-art models. Our method is available in the open-source software SMT.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding contributing neuron features is crucial to explaining convolutional neural network (CNN) decisions. The attribution research provides an effective way to detect contributing neuron features and numerically assign them attribution scores. However, a method to clearly and intuitively represent the implications hidden in neuron attributions is lacking. Attribution scores show the numerical importance of contributing neurons, but the meanings implied by these numerical scores are still not available. To mitigate this gap, we propose an optimization-based visualization method named attribution visualiza-tion, which enables an intuitive understanding of neuron attributions. Our approach is distinguished from existing visualization methods by its ability to produce noise-free result, i.e., the ability to remove irrelevant regions from visualizations. We achieve this by introducing an optimizable mask into the visu-alization process and designing an objective function that simultaneously optimizes the area-constrained mask and visualization. Furthermore, we propose the fractal noise pyramid with diverse and natural fre-quency spectra as our mask perturbation technique which is key to removing unrelated noise in visual-ization. We implement several comparisons and user studies with other visual explanations to demonstrate the unique properties of our attribution visualization. We also apply our attribution visual-ization on two representative CNNs, showcasing its ability to intuitively understand contributing neuron features.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of artificial intelligence tools has led to newly developed collision detectors which have better computational efficiency than the kinematics-and-geometry based collision detectors (KCD) to improve robot motion planning strategies. However, new detectors are not very accurate in some cases. To improve the accuracy, a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy is required. We propose a novel compound collision detector (CCD) for collision queries that modifies the planners of rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) to improve the classical probabilistic collision detector (PCD). It is composed of an exact collision detector (ECD), an inference collision detector (ICD) and a strategy to determine ECD or ICD based on some conditions. In our CCD, we use a sphere-ellipsoidal pseudo distance (SEPD) in the determination strategy to alleviate the problem of highly-frequent outputs of false-positive in narrow passages of PCD, and a node based bounding method (NBB) to increase the speed of data storage and loading for the sub-algorithm ICD. Experiments on a Kinova Jaco assistive robotic arm are taken to evaluate the performance of our CCD, which show an improved accuracy with a small reduction of speed in comparison with PCD. So, it is a promising tool in robot motion planning.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Efficient image super-resolution (SR), being preferred in the resource-constrained scenarios, aims at not only higher super-resolving accuracy but also lower computational complexity. Taking the perception capability of deep networks into account, efficiently and effectively obtaining the large receptive field is a key principle for this task. Thus, in this paper, we integrate the multi-scale receptive field design with information distillation structure and attention mechanism, and develop a lightweight Multi-Scale Information Distillation (MSID) network. In detail, we design a multi-scale feature distillation (MSFD) block by employing multi-scale convolutions with different kernels into feature distillation connection, which effectively distills information from multiple receptive fields with low computational cost for better feature refinement. Moreover, we construct a scalable large kernel attention (SLKA) block via scaling attentive fields across network layers, that possesses large and scalable receptive field in attention to discriminatively enhance the distilled features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of each proposed component and also demonstrate the superiority of our MSID network over state-of-the-art efficient SR methods.

   Synchronization algorithm
AB In large-scale distributed machine learning (DML), the synchronization efficiency of the distributed algorithm becomes a critical factor that affects the training time of machine learning models as the computing scale increases. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm called Grouped Sparse AllReduce based on the 2D-Torus topology (2D-TGSA), which enables constant transmission traffic that does not change with the number of workers. Our experimental results demonstrate that 2D-TGSA outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of synchronization efficiency. Moreover, we integrate the general form consistent ADMM with 2D-TGSA to develop a distributed algorithm (2D-TGSAADMM) that exhibits excellent scalability and can effectively handle large-scale distributed optimization problems. Furthermore, we enhance 2D-TGSA-ADMM by adopting the resilient adaptive penalty parameter approach, resulting in a new algorithm called 2D-TGSA-TPADMM. Our experiments on training the logistic regression model with '1-norm on the Tianhe-2 supercomputing platform demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the synchronization time and training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The construction sector is undergoing a digital transformation that aims to increase productivity, improve processes and take advantage of the new advances in digitalization. Urban planning is particularly susceptible of benefiting from these advances due to its complexity and the large amount of data and disciplines that come together. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that aims to enhance current urban planning design methods, which are mainly designed by a planner, to an optimized process where the planner interacts with a software that automates many of the tasks. This methodology based on generative design principles, develop urban design solutions by subdividing a given plot and assigning different housing typologies on it. Our proposed software requires 3D urban models datasets as a reference to create solutions within a specific shape, style, proportions, among others, as well as input from the planner to guide the program according to project requirements and existing local norms. Higher automation in the design process eases project changes and allows for more and varied design testing, which in the end, contributes to better analysis and decision making. We tested our proposal in a case study in the city of Vienna to illustrate the design process, obtain several urban planning solutions and validate our methodology.

TI Fast Broad Multiview Multi-Instance Multilabel Learning (FBM3L) With
   Viewwise Intercorrelation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Multiview multi-instance multilabel learning (M3L) is a popular research topic during the past few years in modeling complex real-world objects such as medical images and subtitled video. However, existing M3L methods suffer from relatively low accuracy and training efficiency for large datasets due to several issues: 1) the viewwise intercorrelation (i.e., the correlations of instances and/or bags between different views) are neglected; 2) the diverse correlations (e.g., viewwise intercorrelation, interinstance correlation, and interlabel correlation) are not jointly considered; and 3) high computation burden for training process over bags, instances, and labels across different views. To resolve these issues, a novel framework called fast broad M3L (FBM3L) is proposed with three innovations: 1) utilization of viewwise intercorrelation for better modeling of M3L tasks while existing M3L methods have not considered; 2) based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and broad learning system (BLS), a viewwise subnetwork is newly designed to achieve joint learning among the diverse correlations; and 3) under BLS platform, FBM3L can learn multiple subnetworks jointly across all views with significantly less training time. Experiments show that FBM3L is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics [up to 64% in average precision (AP)] and much faster than most M3L (or MIML) methods (up to 1030 times), especially on large multiview datasets (>= 260 K objects).

ID VISUAL NAVIGATION; MOBILE ROBOT; ALGORITHM; LEVEL; GAME; GO
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proven as a powerful approach for robot navigation over the past few years. DRL-based navigation does not require the pre-construction of a map, instead, high-performance navigation skills can be learned from trial-and-error experiences. However, recent DRL-based approaches mostly focus on a fixed navigation target. It is noted that when navigating to a moving target without maps, the performance of the standard RL structure drops dramatically on both the success rate and path efficiency. To address the mapless navigation problem with moving target, the predictive hierarchical DRL (pH-DRL) framework is proposed by integrating the long-term trajectory prediction to provide a cost-effective solution. In the proposed framework, the lower-level policy of the RL agent learns robot control actions to a specified goal, and the higher-level policy learns to make long-range planning of shorter navigation routes by sufficiently exploiting the predicted trajectories. By means of making decisions over two level of policies, the pH-DRL framework is robust to the unavoidable errors in long-term predictions. With the application of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for policy optimization, the pH-DDPG algorithm is developed based on the pH-DRL structure. Finally, through comparative experiments on the Gazebo simulator with several variants of the DDPG algorithm, the results demonstrate that the pH-DDPG outperforms other algorithms and achieves a high success rate and efficiency even though the target moves fast and randomly. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs), as one of the brain-inspired models, has spatio-temporal information processing capability, low power feature, and high biological plausibility. The effective spatio-temporal feature makes it suitable for event streams classification. However, neuromorphic datasets, such as NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128-gesture, need to aggregate individual events into frames with a new higher temporal resolution for event stream classification, which causes high training and inference latency. In this work, we proposed a spatio-temporal compression method to aggregate individual events into a few time steps of synaptic current to reduce the training and inference latency. To keep the accuracy of SNNs under high compression ratios, we also proposed a synaptic convolutional block to balance the dramatic changes between adjacent time steps. And multi-threshold Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) models with learnable membrane time constants are introduced to increase their information processing capability. We evaluate the proposed method for event stream classification tasks on neuromorphic NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 gesture datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB On general regular simplicial partitions T of bounded polytopal domains S2 c Rd, d E {2, 3}, we construct exact neural network (NN) emulations of all lowest order finite element spaces in the discrete de Rham complex. These include the spaces of piecewise constant functions, continuous piecewise linear (CPwL) functions, the classical "Raviart-Thomas element", and the "Nedelec edge element". For all but the CPwL case, our network architectures employ both ReLU (rectified linear unit) and BiSU (binary step unit) activations to capture discontinuities. In the important case of CPwL functions, we prove that it suffices to work with pure ReLU nets. Our construction and DNN architecture generalizes previous results in that no geometric restrictions on the regular simplicial partitions T of S2 are required for DNN emulation. In addition, for CPwL functions our DNN construction is valid in any dimension d > 2. Our "FE-Nets"are required in the variationally correct, structure-preserving approximation of boundary value problems of electromagnetism in nonconvex polyhedra S2 c R3. They are thus an essential ingredient in the application of e.g., the methodology of "physics-informed NNs"or "deep Ritz methods"to electromagnetic field simulation via deep learning techniques. We indicate generalizations of our constructions to higher-order compatible spaces and other, non-compatible classes of discretizations, in particular the "Crouzeix-Raviart"elements and Hybridized, Higher Order (HHO) methods.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Anomaly detection on multivariate time series (MTS) is of great importance in both data mining research and industrial applications. While a handful of anomaly detection models are developed for MTS data, most of them either ignore the potential correlations between different variables or overlook the different importance of variables at each time period in MTS, which leads to poor accuracy in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised MUltivariate Time series ANomaly deTection framework (MUTANT), which simultaneously models the correlations between variables and the importance of variables at each time period. Specifically, we construct a feature graph for variables in each time window and perform graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn embeddings for all variables, which effectively captures the time-varying correlations between variables in MTS. Then, we propose an attention-based reconstruction model to learn robust latent representations to capture normal patterns of MTS by modeling the importance of variables based on time dependencies along with time dimension. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-life datasets from different industrial domains. Experimental results show that MUTANT significantly outperforms stateof-the-art MTS anomaly detection methods, achieving an average anomaly detection F1-score higher than 0.96.

AB Chinese short text classification approaches based on lexicon information and pretrained language models have yielded state-of-the-art results. However, they simply use the pretrained language model as an embedding layer and fuse lexicon features while not fully utilizing the advantages of either. In this paper, we propose a new model, the bidirectional lattice graph attention network (BiLGAT). It enhances the representation of characters by aggregating the features of different hidden states of BERT. The lexicon features in the lattice graph are fused into character features with the powerful representation capability of the graph attention network, and the problem of word segmentation error propagation is solved at the same time. The experimental results on three Chinese short text classification datasets demonstrate the superior performance of this method. Among these datasets, 94.75% accuracy was achieved on THUCNEWS, 70.71% accuracy was achieved on TNEWS, and 86.49% accuracy was achieved on CNT.

ID NETWORK; ATTENTION
AB Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) has been increasingly studied and the detection performance has been greatly improved based on deep learning models in recent years. However, the context and boundary information have not been efficiently used simultaneously in the existing COD methods, leading to inferior detection for large camouflaged objects, occluded objects, multiple and small objects, and objects with rich boundaries. Therefore, to effectively enhance the performance of COD, we propose a novel camouflaged object detection model, i.e., context-aware and boundary refinement (CABR). Specifically, CABR mainly consists of three modules: the global context information enhanced module (GCIEM), the attention-inducing neighbor fusion module (AINFM), and the boundary refinement module (BRM). GCIEM is designed to fully capture the long-range dependencies to obtain rich global context information to completely detect large objects and occluded objects. AINFM is capable of adaptively fusing adjacent layers to focus on the global and local context information simultaneously to improve the detection performance of multiple and small camouflaged objects effectively. BRM can refine the boundaries by utilizing the spatial information in low-level features and suppressing the non-camouflage factors to detect camouflaged objects with rich boundaries effectively. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CABR with competitive performance to existing state-of-the-art methods according to most evaluation metrics.

AB The integration of Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) and Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is critical for satisfying the demanding requirements of vehicular applications, which are characterized by ultra-low latency and ultra-high reliability. In this paper, we address the challenge of jointly optimizing computation offloading and resource allocation in C-V2X network. To achieve this, we propose a hierarchical MEC/C-V2X network that accounts for the dynamic changes of the vehicular network and the diversity of computation offloading patterns. Additionally, we establish a collaborative computation offloading model that supports multiple offloading patterns. We formulate the dynamic computation offloading and resource allocation problem as a sequential decision problem based on the Markovian decision process. To enable automated and intelligent decision-making, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called ORAD, based on the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, to maximize offloading success rate in real-time. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively provides the optimal policy, resulting in the offloading success rate of vehicular tasks being improved by 2.73% to 95.51%.

AB We present a method for training neural networks with synthetic electrocardiograms that mimic signals produced by a wearable single lead electrocardiogram monitor. We use domain randomization where the synthetic signal properties such as the waveform shape, RR-intervals and noise are varied for every training example. Models trained with synthetic data are compared to their counterparts trained with real data. Detection of r-waves in electrocardiograms recorded during different physical activities and in atrial fibrillation is used to assess the performance. By allowing the randomization of the synthetic signals to increase beyond what is typically observed in the real-world data the performance is on par or superseding the performance of networks trained with real data. Experiments show robust model performance using different seeds and on different unseen test sets that were fully separated from the training phase. The ability of the model to generalize well to hidden test sets without any specific tuning provides a simple and explainable alternative to more complex adversarial domain adaptation methods for model generalization. This method opens up the possibility of extending the use of synthetic data towards domain insensitive cardiac disease classification when disease specific a priori information is used in the electrocardiogram generation. Additionally, the method provides training with free-to-collect data with accurate labels, control of the data distribution eliminating class imbalances that are typically observed in health-related data, and the generated data is inherently private.

AB Deep support vector data description (DeSVDD) is an emerging anomaly detection method based on the deep learning methodology. However, few studies take the confidence of DeSVDD predictions into account so that the present DeSVDD models cannot indicate the reliability degree of the anomaly detection results. In this paper, we enrich the theory of DeSVDD by building the model confidence definition and developing the corresponding calibration strategy. For one thing, by revisiting the methodology of DeSVDD-based anomaly detection, the confidence of detection results is presented to indicate if the prediction of DeSVDD is reliable. For another, we propose a modified power T-scaling strategy to smooth the anomaly scores of DeSVDD model and improve its calibration performance without changing the original detection results. Six open experiment datasets are used to perform the method testing and the experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed calibration strategy.

AB Multimodal data fusion is a critical element of fall detection systems, as it provides more comprehensive information than single-modal data. Yet, data heterogeneity between sources has posed a challenge for the effective fusion of such data. This paper proposes a novel multimodal data fusion method under a federated learning (FL) framework that addresses the privacy concerns of users while exploiting the complementarity of such data. Specifically, we fuse time-series data from wearable sensors and visual data from cameras at the input level, where the data is first transformed into images using the Gramian Angular Field (GAF) method. Moreover, each user is treated as a private client in the FL system whereby the fall detection model is trained without requiring the sharing of user data. The proposed method is evaluated using the UP-Fall dataset, where we perform different fall detection tasks: binary classification for fall and non-fall detection yields a remarkable accuracy of 99.927%, while multi-classification for different fall activity recognition attains an accurate result of 89.769%.

AB Modeling complex physical processes such as the extraction of aluminum is mainly done using pure physics-based models derived from first principles. However, the accuracy of these models can often suffer due to a partial understanding of the process, uncertainty in the input parameters, and numerous modeling assumptions. More recently, with the ever-increasing availability of data, there has been an explosion of interest in applying modern machine learning methods because of their ability to learn complex mappings directly from data. Unfortunately, these models tend to be black boxes, require an enormous amount of data, and do not utilize existing domain knowledge. In this work, we develop a novel approach combining physics-based and data-driven modeling approaches while eliminating some weaknesses. We use a data-driven model to correct a misspecified physics-based model of the Hall-Heroult process in an aluminum electrolysis cell using a corrective source term added to the set of governing ordinary differential equations. Our approach ensures that the existing knowledge is utilized to the maximum extent possible while relying on the data-driven models only to model those aspects which the physics-based model does not represent well. We compare this approach with an end-to-end learning approach and an ablated physics-based model, showing that the proposed hybrid method is more accurate, consistent, and stable for long-term predictions.

AB Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for smart city development in the new era. However, the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data present significant challenges for prediction accuracy. Existing methods often rely on predefined adjacency matrices to capture Spatio-temporal dependencies, which may not adapt well to the dynamic nature of road traffic. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-Spatiotemporal Fusion Graph Recurrent Network (MSTFGRN). This innovative approach introduces a data-driven method for generating a weighted adjacency matrix, effectively capturing real-time spatial dependencies that are not adequately captured by predefined matrices. The MSTFGRN also incorporates a novel two-way Spatio-temporal fusion operation to learn hidden dependencies between parallel Spatio-temporal relations at different time points. Additionally, a global attention mechanism is integrated into the Spatio-temporal fusion module, enabling the simultaneous capture of global Spatio-temporal dependencies. Through extensive trials on publicly available highway traffic datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance compared to alternative baselines.

AB This research paper focuses on quaternion neural networks (QNNs) -a type of neural network wherein the weights, biases, and input values are all represented as quaternion numbers. Previous studies have shown that QNNs outperform real-valued neural networks in basic tasks and have potential in high-dimensional problem spaces. However, research on QNNs has been fragmented, with contributions from different mathematical and engineering domains leading to unintentional overlap in QNN literature. This work aims to unify existing research by evaluating four distinct QNN backpropagation algorithms, including the novel GHR-calculus backpropagation algorithm, and providing concise, scalable implementations of each algorithm using a modern compiled programming language. Additionally, the authors apply a robust Design of Experiments (DoE) methodology to compare the accuracy and runtime of each algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that the Clifford Multilayer Perceptron (CMLP) learning algorithm results in statistically significant improvements in network test set accuracy while maintaining comparable runtime performance to the other three algorithms in four distinct regression tasks. By unifying existing research and comparing different QNN training algorithms, this work develops a state-of-the-art baseline and provides important insights into the potential of QNNs for solving high-dimensional problems.

AB The presence of vegetation in the water bodies has a profound effect on the flow velocity in an open channel due to the resistance offered by it. In rivers, estuaries, and coastal locations, vegetation significantly impacts the local hydrodynamics, which in turn affects various morphodynamic and biophysical processes. In this context, an accurate prediction of flow velocity in a vegetative alluvial channel is paramount. Several empirical and data-driven methodologies have been proposed as viable solutions in the literature to predict the flow velocity in a vegetative alluvial channel. Empirical equations cannot always be trusted to be accurate, but they have the advantage of being simple and physically appealing. Since machine learning (ML) techniques can capture complicated non-linear correlations, they are frequently employed to map natural processes. In this work, we investigate the performance of multiple standalone and hybrid Machine Learning (ML) techniques for predicting flow velocity (U) in a vegetative alluvial channel. An array of datasets available in the literature, comprising wide ranges of the number of cylinders per unit horizontal area (m), flow depth (h), channel slope (I), height of the vegetation (k), diameter of cylindrical vegetation (D), and non-dimensional drag coefficient (Cd) have been utilized in this study. For standalone methods, we made use of the M5Prime and Random Tree (RT) methods, while for hybrid ML method approaches, we made use of the Additive Regressor (AR) and Bagging (BA) methods. In the present study, six ML methods, viz., M5P, AR-M5P, BA-M5P, RT, BA-RT, and AR-RT, have been explored and their performance has also been analyzed. Among the proposed methods, AR-M5P provides the highest prediction (R2 = 0.954, CC = 0.977, NSE = 0.954, MAE = 0.042, MSE = 0.003, and Pbias = 1.466), followed by BA-M5P, BA-RT, M5P, RT, and AR-RT for the prediction of flow velocity in a vegetative alluvial channel. We have also performed the sensitivity analysis and found that the height of vegetation is the most sensitive variable in flow velocity prediction.

AB Vaccines have saved people from the panic of infectious diseases. However, vaccine hesitation caused by vaccination risks makes vaccination a dilemma. Given the differences in the sensitivity of individuals to payoffs, this work analyzes the vaccination dilemma in mixed populations comprising conformity and rational individuals and explore the reasons for the groups to maintain cooperation. A cooperative environment is essential for maintaining cooperative behavior, as indicated by an analysis of adaptive strategies. Spurred by these findings, we propose the circle centrality concept that measures the ability of individuals to maintain strategies within a mixed-type populations. Moreover, this work proposes a budget-conscious algorithm to identify influential individuals in mixed populations for vaccination prioritization, using circle centrality as the criteria. This approach takes into account financial constraints of the funds available. The results demonstrate that prioritizing individuals based on circle centrality using our proposed method is more effective than random investment (RI) in promoting vaccine acceptance of the population and overcoming vaccine hesitancy. Simulation results on both synthetic and real-world networks support this finding. This work has implications for early vaccination campaigns in cash-strapped sectors during short-term outbreaks such as COVID-19.

AB Current models on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have shown a lack of reliability when evaluating feature-relevance for deep neural biomarker classifiers. The inclusion of reliable saliency-maps for obtaining trustworthy and interpretable neural activity is still insufficiently mature for practical applications. These limitations impede the development of clinical applications of Deep Learning. To address, these limitations we propose the RemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) algorithm which supports the recovery of highly relevant features from any pre-trained deep neural network. In this study we evaluated the ROAR methodology and algorithm for the Face Emotion Recognition (FER) task, which is clinically applicable in the study of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals and assessed the relevance of FER-elicited EEG features from individuals diagnosed with and without ASD. Specifically, we compared the ROAR reliability from well-known relevance maps such as Layer Wise Relevance Propagation, PatternNet, Pattern-Attribution, and Smooth-Grad Squared. This study is the first to bridge previous neuroscience and ASD research findings to feature-relevance calculation for EEG-based emotion recognition with CNN in typically-development (TD) and in ASD individuals.

ID ONE-CLASS CLASSIFICATION
AB Anomaly detection is currently an essential quality monitoring process in industrial production. It is often affected by factors such as under or over reconstruction of images and unclear criteria for feature distribution evaluation, thus making it challenging to improve detection performance. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a novel transformer-based approach, Inductive Transformer (ITran) for industrial anomaly detection and localization, which utilizes a multi-layer pyramid structure and multi-level jump connections to extract multi-scale features of the data, putting the anomaly detection into the feature space and achieving more accurate industrial anomaly detection and localization results. It incorporates inductive bias and convolution operations into the Transformer which helps to break the myth of Transformer being "data hungry". Compared with the common Transformers, ITran significantly reduces the computational cost and memory usage and makes it work well on small datasets. In addition, we basically eliminate the effect of positional embedding on the proposed Transformer model. Sufficient experiments have been conducted to validate global anomaly detection on three datasets MNIST, Fashion-MNST and Cifar-10, as well as local anomaly detection on the industrial datasets MVTec AD, Concrete Crack Image and BTAD. The proposed ITran achieves outstanding results on all the above datasets.

AB Compressive sensing can be conceptualized for a classification problem in the context of representation learning, which is frequently applied for signal reconstruction via a few measurements. A novel compressive sensing-based approach is presented to substantially reduce the number of required samples for classification. This technique considers the pixels of image as sensors and it seeks to identify the most optimum sensors as decision variables in feature space. In this study, Spatial sensor locations are acquired through learning to identify the regions within an image where the most discriminative information for classification is embedded. ������1-2 minimization, as nonconvex but Lipschitz continuous, is solved to obtain the least non-zero elements of the full measurement vector to completely reconstruct the discriminative vector in feature space. Optimal sensors are localized from the training-set and subsequent test images are categorized based on learned sensors. The algorithm consists of three primary components: sparse minimization, feature space, and discrimination vector. ������1-2 minimization, rank-revealing QR factorization (RRQR) and SVM are considered for enhanced sparsity exploitation, feature space extraction and discrimination vector acquiring, respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on four different experiments and is compared against a state-of-art technique. The results demonstrate the superiority of proposed method to the compared method.

AB Extracting representative features to recognize human activities through the use of wearables is an area of on-going research. While hand-crafted features and machine learning (ML) techniques have been sufficiently well investigated in the past, the use of deep learning (DL) techniques is the current trend. Specifically, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and hybrid models have been investigated. We propose a novel hybrid network architecture to recognize human activities through the use of wearable motion sensors and DL techniques. The LSTM and the 2D CNN branches of the model that run in parallel receive the raw signals and their spectrograms, respectively. We concatenate the features extracted at each branch and use them for activity recognition. We compare the classification performance of the proposed network with three single and three hybrid commonly used network architectures: 1D CNN, 2D CNN, LSTM, standard 1D CNN-LSTM, 1D CNN-LSTM proposed by Ordonez and Roggen, and an alternative 1D CNN-LSTM model. We tune the hyper-parameters of six of the models using Bayesian optimization and test the models on two publicly available datasets. The comparison between the seven networks is based on four performance metrics and complexity measures. Because of the stochastic nature of DL algorithms, we provide the average values and standard deviations of the performance metrics over ten repetitions of each experiment. The proposed 2D CNN-LSTM architecture achieves the highest average accuracies of 95.66% and 92.95% on the two datasets, which are, respectively, 2.45% and 3.18% above those of the 2D CNN model that ranks the second. This improvement is a consequence of the proposed model enabling the extraction of a broader range of complementary features that comprehensively represent human activities. We evaluate the complexities of the networks in terms of the total number of parameters, model size, training/testing time, and the number of floating point operations (FLOPs). We also compare the results of the proposed network with those of recent related work that use the same datasets.

AB Face recognition is a very active research topic due to the number of potential applications that use this technique and the number of challenges that still require efforts to solve them. However, new research problems arise when dealing with devices operating in real-time, and using a non-controlled image source such as surveillance cameras, due to the needs and context of end-use. A robust and efficient face recognition system is proposed in this paper to monitor unauthorized access to equipments in a room using a surveillance camera. The system is based on a person detection algorithm adapted to the context of use, a person tracking algorithm robust to occlusion, a face detection algorithm robust to orientation and scale, and a face recognition algorithm robust to illumination change. To enhance the efficiency of person identification, a novel strategy for estimating the confidence of face recognition is proposed in this paper. This is achieved by leveraging the general conditions of the image used for this purpose. This technique allows to increase the identification rate while minimizing the false alarm rate. An effort is also made to optimize the implementation of the developed algorithms to guarantee a real-time operation while keeping a very high efficiency. Also, the evaluations of the proposed algorithms on public and private data show an improvement of the accuracy on the whole context of use of the proposed system. Furthermore the evaluation of the system in general shows a high efficiency, 100% detection of unauthorized accesses and 0 false alarms.

AB Nearest neighbor-based methods are classic techniques that, due to their efficiency, still are widely used today. However, they have not been broadly applied to solve the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) problem, a supervised learning paradigm that combines multi-instance (MI) and multi-label (ML) learning. This work presents new neighbor-based approaches for solving MIML problems. On the one hand, MIML data are transformed into ML data and ML nearest neighbor algorithms are used. On the other hand, algorithms that directly address MIML data and use a bag-based distance are proposed. A comprehensive study and an overall comparison have been conducted to study the performance of these methods using different configurations. Experiments included 16 datasets and 8 performance metrics. The results and statistical tests showed that the problem transformation applied and the distance function used impacted the performance and that the approaches that do not transform the problem obtained the best predictive results. Furthermore, most of the proposed algorithms outperformed the MIMLkNN algorithm, the state-of-art algorithm for MIML learning based on nearest-neighbor. Therefore, the relevance and capabilities of neighbor-based approaches to obtain competitive results in MIML learning are shown. Finally, all the algorithms developed in this paper have been included in the MIML library to facilitate the comparison with other future proposals.

AB This study considers an extension of the two-Echelon Location-Routing Problem (2E-LRP) namely two-Echelon Location-Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery (2E-LRPSPD). A Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulation is developed and strengthened by the use of valid inequalities to solve the 2E-LRPSPD, and then a Branch and Cut-based exact algorithm (B & C) is presented. To improve the upper bounds, Iterated Local Search and Variable Neighborhood Search-based metaheuristic algorithms, namely, ILS-VNS and VNS, are developed and embedded into the B & C. Computational results, conducted on instances produced from the literature, demonstrate that the B & C yields tight lower and upper bounds, and also is capable of solving some instances optimally with up to 50 customers and 10 satellites in a reasonable time. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis reveals that the heuristic approaches and an increase in the runtime limit assist the algorithm to reach tight upper bounds, whereas the number of potential depots does not have any effect on the performance of the algorithm. Besides, further computational analysis on the 2E-LRPSPD with a single depot, which is studied in the literature, shows that the B & C improves some best-known solutions while proving the optimality of some instances. Finally, the B & C is applied to a two-echelon supermarket distribution system in Turkiye. The computational results show that simultaneous pickup and delivery operations, as well as depot location decisions are critical elements to consider in the design of cost-effective distribution networks.

AB It is generally known that pan-sharpening is fundamentally a PAN-guided multispectral (MS) image super-resolution problem that involves learning the nonlinear mapping from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) MS images. Since an infinite number of HR-MS images can be downsampled to produce the same corresponding LR-MS image, learning the mapping from LR-MS to HR-MS image is typically ill-posed and the space of the possible pan-sharpening functions can be extremely large, making it difficult to estimate the optimal mapping solution. To address the above issue, we propose a closed-loop scheme that learns the two opposite mapping including the pan-sharpening and its corresponding degradation process simultaneously to regularize the solution space in a single pipeline. More specifically, an invertible neural network (INN) is introduced to perform a bidirectional closed-loop: the forward operation for LR-MS pan-sharpening and the backward operation for learning the corresponding HR-MS image degradation process. In addition, given the vital importance of high-frequency textures for the Pan-sharpened MS images, we further strengthen the INN by designing a specified multiscale high-frequency texture extraction module. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively with fewer parameters. Ablation studies also verify the effectiveness of the closed-loop mechanism in pan-sharpening.

AB Organ transplantation is the ultimate option to treat terminal illness by transplanting the deceased or damaged organs with healthy organs for improving the patient's life expectancy. The number of organs needed and the organs available for transplantation vary enormously. The tremendous advancements in utilizing big data analytics in the healthcare system make it efficient to explore decision-making information. To make optimal decisions in organ transplantation, this paper proposes a modified convolutional neural network-hybrid extreme learning machine (MCNN-HELM) based prediction model. The proposed MCNN-HELM model utilizes three different real-time datasets as inputs which contain records of liver, heart, and lung transplantation details of the donor and recipient. At first, the missing values and inaccurate data present in real-time datasets are removed via pre-processing. The pre-processed data are then trained using the MCNN-HELM model that efficiently determines the suitable donor for the recipient by minimizing the waiting time of the recipient for the matching organ donor. Moreover, the MCNN-HELM model gives initial preference to patients with high-risk rates to improve their quality of life. The proposed MCNN-HELM model achieves training accuracy of 97.5% with a computational time of 2.2 s, while the precision value of estimated factual outcomes, potential outcomes, and the accuracy of the best donor type are obtained by 16.3582, 16.1401, and 0.6784 which are more efficient than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Recently, motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification techniques using deep learning have shown improved performance over conventional techniques. However, improving the classification accuracy on unseen subjects is still challenging due to intersubject variability, scarcity of labeled unseen subject data, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this context, we propose a novel two-way few-shot network able to efficiently learn how to learn representative features of unseen subject categories and classify them with limited MI EEG data. The pipeline includes an embedding module that learns feature representations from a set of signals, a temporal-attention module to emphasize important temporal features, an aggregation-attention module for key support signal discovery, and a relation module for final classification based on relation scores between a support set and a query signal. In addition to the unified learning of feature similarity and a few-shot classifier, our method can emphasize informative features in support data relevant to the query, which generalizes better on unseen subjects. Furthermore, we propose to fine-tune the model before testing by arbitrarily sampling a query signal from the provided support set to adapt to the distribution of the unseen subject. We evaluate our proposed method with three different embedding modules on cross-subject and cross-dataset classification tasks using brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV 2a, 2b, and GIST datasets. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly improves over the baselines and outperforms existing few-shot approaches.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are widely used in a variety of applications and can be seen as an unstructured version of standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). As in CNNs, the computational cost of GCNs for large input graphs (such as large point clouds or meshes) can be high and inhibit the use of these networks, especially in environments with low computational resources. To ease these costs, quantization can be applied to GCNs. However, aggressive quantization of the feature maps can lead to a significant degradation in performance. On a different note, the Haar wavelet transforms are known to be one of the most effective and efficient approaches to compress signals. Therefore, instead of applying aggressive quantization to feature maps, we propose to use Haar wavelet compression and light quantization to reduce the computations involved with the network. We demonstrate that this approach surpasses aggressive feature quantization by a significant margin, for a variety of problems ranging from node classification to point cloud classification and both part and semantic segmentation.

AB Incomplete multiview clustering (IMC) is a hot and emerging topic. It is well known that unavoidable data incompleteness greatly weakens the effective information of multiview data. To date, existing IMC methods usually bypass unavailable views according to prior missing information, which is considered a second-best scheme based on evasion. Other methods that attempt to recover missing information are mostly applicable to specific two-view datasets. To handle these problems, in this article, we propose an information-recovery-driven-deep IMC network, termed as RecFormer. Concretely, a two-stage autoencoder network with self-attention structure is built to synchronously extract high-level semantic representations of multiple views and recover the missing data. Besides, we develop a recurrent graph reconstruction mechanism that cleverly leverages the restored views to promote representation learning and further data reconstruction. Visualization of recovery results are given and sufficient experimental results confirm that our RecFormer has obvious advantages over other top methods.

AB An important task in automatic facial expression recognition (FER) is to describe facial image features effectively and efficiently. Facial expression descriptors must be robust to variable scales, illumination changes, face view, and noise. This article studies the application of spatially modified local descriptors to extract robust features for facial expressions recognition. The experiments are carried out in two phases: firstly, we motivate the need for face registration by comparing the extraction of features from registered and non-registered faces, and secondly, four local descriptors (Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Compound Local Binary Patterns (CLBP), and Weber's Local Descriptor (WLD)) are optimized by finding the best parameter values for their extraction. Our study reveals that face registration is an important step that can improve the recognition rate of FER systems. We also highlight that a suitable parameter selection can increase the performance of existing local descriptors as compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Logistics enterprises are moving towards high efficiency and green. As an emerging technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, also known as drone) is very useful to cope with flexible and fast delivery. Electric vehicles (EVs), as new energy vehicles, are the technical support for green logistics development. This paper considers the lastmile delivery system in which a fleet of homogeneous EVs, equipped with a UAV each, serve a set of customers, and meanwhile battery swapping vehicles (BSVs) offer mobile battery swapping service for EVs. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is formulated to minimize the sum of depreciation cost, driver wages and energy consumption cost of EVs, UAVs, and BSVs, by considering the nonlinear energy consumption of each vehicle, time-dependent speeds of EVs and BSVs and monetary time value on depreciation cost. A large neighborhood search algorithm based on Q-learning (LNS-QL) is designed in which Q-learning is used to select a combination of tailored destroy and repair operators to solve three sub-problems, (1) the UAV multi-visit problem, (2) the EV and UAV synchronized scheduling problem, (3) the EV and BSV synchronized mobile battery swapping problem. Besides, this paper also designs Lagrangian relaxation algorithm for comparison with LNS-QL. Extensive experiments verify the correctness of the model by testing small-scale instances. Further analysis demonstrates the accuracy and stability of LNS-QL on medium and large-scale instances as well as computational time and verifies the effectiveness of the mobile battery swapping mode in the cooperative delivery system of EVs and UAVs. Actual cases analyze the characteristics of EV delivery from the cost and emissions perspectives by comparing with FV delivery.

DE Heterogeneous graph embedding; Semantic confusion; Graph neural network
AB Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) has shown a great promising in embedding complex structural and semantic information of heterogeneous graph. However, many popular HGNNs fail to capture the meaningful characteristics to distinguish heterogeneous nodes, known as the semantic confusion problem. In this paper, we hold that semantic confusion problem can be addressed by jumping knowledge toward semantics enrichment, and propose a general framework for heterogeneous graph embedding named Semantic -guided Graph Neural Network (SGNN). Here, we develop novel two-level fusion mechanisms in both node and semantic aggregation. In the node-level, we aggregate the local neighbors with jumping knowledge to learn an enhanced local representation. In the semantic-level, we maximize the common representation to extract the jumping knowledge from multiple semantics in latent space. The common representation is injected into semantic-level aggregation as jumping knowledge to guide the model to pay more attention on target semantics. In the end, the semantic confusion problem is shown to be alleviated in the two-level semantic-guided aggregation framework of SGNN through both theory and experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that SGNN gains highest results in real-world tasks. We also perform validation experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of aggregation mechanism towards semantic confusion in each level, and the results show superiority of SGNN.

AB Determining the best way to measure level of customer satisfaction (LCS) with service quality and its determinants has been a matter of concern for both practitioners and researchers. This is especially so, as LCS can be used to retain customers, sell products and services, improve the quality and value of offers and ensure more efficient and economical operating. The present study proposes a new LCS evaluation methodology that combines data envelopment analysis (DEA) with text mining to analyze online textual reviews. The proposed methodology identifies, from online reviews using a term-frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, multiple satisfaction metrics that significantly affect customers' service experience, quantifies them by sentiment analysis, and evaluates, by a DEA model, service providers' LCS with respect to those metrics. To illustrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed approach, an empirical case study applying it to the world's top 20 airlines in 2020 was conducted. This study demonstrates how the DEA model can be effectively utilized for evaluation of LCS from online textual review data by combining it with the TF-IDF text-mining technique.

   Non-maximal suppression (NMS)
AB Precisely perceiving the environment through a 3D perspective is essential and challenging for autonomous navigation and driving. Existing techniques rely on depth from LiDAR data or disparity in stereo vision to solve the poorly presented problem of detecting far-off and occluded objects. This increases structure complexity and computation burden, especially for single-stage systems. We argue that existing well-established detectors have the intrinsic potential to detect full-scene objects, but the extrinsic capabilities are limited by the structure form and optimization. Hence, we propose a double-branch single-stage monocular 3D object detection framework that aligns binary centers of object. Structurally, we construct two symmetrical and independent detectors, respectively using different prediction manners for 3D box parameters. Functionally, two detection heads have different sensitivities for the same object due to disentangling alignment. During the training, the detection heads were trained separately to obtain specific ability and aligned to promote the convergence. At inference, predictions of two branches are filtered via depth-aware non-maximal suppression (NMS) to acquire comprehensive detection results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance in monocular 3D detection on the KITTI-3D benchmark. (C) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Virtual Machine Replica Placement Using a Multiobjective Genetic

DT Article
ID MANY-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; ALLOCATION
AB Virtual machine (VM) replication is a critical task in any cloud computing platform to ensure the availability of the cloud service for the end user. In this task, one primary VM resides on a physical machine (PM) and one or more replicas reside on separate PMs. In cloud computing, VM placement (VMP) is a well-studied problem in terms of different goals, such as power consumption reduction. The VMP problem can be solved by using heuristics, namely, first-fit and meta-heuristics such as the genetic algorithm. Despite extensive research into the VMP problem, there are few works that consider VM replication when choosing a VMP. In this context, we proposed studying the problem of optimal VMP considering VM replication requirements. The proposed work frames the problem at hand as a multiobjective problem and adapts a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to address the problem. VM replicas' placement should consider several dimensions such as the geographical distance between the PM hosting the primary VM and the other PMs hosting the replicas. In addition, to this end, the proposed model aims to minimize (1) power consumption, (2) performance degradation, and (3) the distance between the PMs hosting the primary VM and its replica(s). The proposed method is thoroughly tested on a variety of computing environments with various heterogeneous VMs and PMs, including compute-intensive and memory-intensive environments. The obtained results illustrate the performance disparity between the adapted NSGA-III and MOEA/D methods and other methods of comparison, including heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches, with NSGA-III outperforming other comparison methods. For instance, in memory-intensive and in heterogeneous environments, the NSGA-III method's performance was superior to the first-fit, next-fit, best-fit, PSO, and MOEA/D methods by 58%, 62%, 64%, 55%, and 31%, respectively.

AB Early fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis are of great importance for predictive maintenance of rotating machinery. To accurately extract early fault features from original noisy signals, a novel joint sparse representation learning method is developed in this paper, this method is based on the proposed nonlocal generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty and generalized fraction-order total variation (FTV) regularization. The motivation for this research is to leverage the benefits of joint regularizations. The proposed nonlocal GMC penalty regularization tends to preserve weak fault features, promote sparsity and avoid underestimating the amplitude of periodic fault impulses. Simultaneously, the proposed generalized FTV regularization tends to remove fault irrelevant noise and reduce staircase artifacts. Therefore, the proposed model can effectively extract early fault features from original noisy signals. The performance of the proposed model is verified by a series of experiments. In two fault diagnosis tasks, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of the proposed method reaches - 5 dB and - 8 dB, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the PSNR has been improved by at least 2 dB, comparison results show that the proposed model has superior performance for early fault feature extraction.

AB Deep-learning-based methods are widely used in multisource remote-sensing image classification, and the improvement in their performance confirms the effectiveness of deep learning for classification tasks. However, the inherent underlying problems of deep-learning models still hinder the further improvement of classification accuracy. For example, after multiple rounds of optimization learning, representation bias and classifier bias are accumulated, which prevents the further optimization of network performance. In addition, the imbalance of fusion information among multisource images also leads to insufficient information interaction throughout the fusion process, thus making it difficult to fully utilize the complementary information of multisource data. To address these issues, a Representation-enhanced Status Replay Network (RSRNet) is proposed. First, a dual augmentation including modal augmentation and semantic augmentation is proposed to enhance the transferability and discreteness of feature representation, to reduce the impact of representation bias in the feature extractor. Then, to alleviate the classifier bias and maintain the stability of the decision boundary, a status replay strategy (SRS) is built to regulate the learning and optimization of the classifier. Finally, aiming to improve the interactivity of modal fusion, a novel cross-modal interactive fusion (CMIF) method is employed to jointly optimize the parameters of different branches by combining multisource information. Quantitative and qualitative results on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of RSRNet in multisource remote-sensing image classification, and its outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

TI An Adaptive Deep Metric Learning Loss Function for Class-Imbalance
   Learning via Intraclass Diversity and Interclass Distillation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

   discriminant feature; loss function with adaptive weights; semantic
   correlations between classes
AB Deep metric learning (DML) has been widely applied in various tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis and face recognition) due to the effective extraction of discriminant features via reducing data overlapping. However, in practice, these tasks also easily suffer from two class-imbalance learning (CIL) problems: data scarcity and data density, causing misclassification. Existing DML losses rarely consider these two issues, while CIL losses cannot reduce data overlapping and data density. In fact, it is a great challenge for a loss function to mitigate the impact of these three issues simultaneously, which is the objective of our proposed intraclass diversity and interclass distillation (IDID) loss with adaptive weight in this article. IDID-loss generates diverse features within classes regardless of the class sample size (to alleviate the issues of data scarcity and data density) and simultaneously preserves the semantic correlations between classes using learnable similarity when pushing different classes away from each other (to reduce overlapping). In summary, our IDID-loss provides three advantages: 1) it can simultaneously mitigate all the three issues while DML and CIL losses cannot; 2) it generates more diverse and discriminant feature representations with higher generalization ability, compared with DML losses; and 3) it provides a larger improvement on the classes of data scarcity and density with a smaller sacrifice on easy class accuracy, compared with CIL losses. Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets show that our IDID-loss achieves the best performances in terms of G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy when compared with both state-of-the-art (SOTA) DML and CIL losses. In addition, it gets rid of the time-consuming fine-tuning process over the hyperparameters of loss function.

AB Identifying and discriminating of pure edible oils as well as detecting and identifying the type of adulteration, are essential issues in the field of food-related research. Extra virgin olive, hazelnut, canola, soya, and sunflower oils were investigated by Raman spectroscopy to answer two main questions: How can it be recognized that an unknown sample of edible oil belongs to one of these five types of pure oil? Also, if the unknown sample is adulterated extra virgin olive oil, how can the type and composition of that sample be recognized? The problembased research was planned by proposing a combined classification strategy for achieving the proper solutions. In this approach, class modeling was combined with discriminant analysis to benefit from the advantages of both methods. In the first step, the Raman spectra of five pure edible oil classes were used to model the target objects by DD-SIMCA to exclude adulterated samples. Then PLS-DA was used for the discrimination of five edible oils classes. This strategy was successfully applied for several binary classes, including different types of extra virgin olive oil adulterations with different compositions. Raman spectroscopy, accompanied by the proposed combined classification strategy, showed good power in solving the pattern recognition problems in food adulteration subjects. The proposed combined classification strategy allowed the discrimination between pure edible oil samples with up to 100% of correct classifications. The developed method showed also high performances based on the figures of merit (up to 100% sensitivity and specificity) for the detection and identification the type of adulteration in extra virgin olive oil.

AB With the growing complexity of onboard sensors and the widespread deployment of road sensors, deep learning enables fine-grained traffic prediction using massive amounts of raw traffic data, which facilitates accurate analysis of traffic information in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, most existing studies focus on using all the local data to jointly build a prediction model, facing severe challenges of data security and privacy concerns as well as substantial communication overhead. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Traffic Prediction Network based on federated learning (F-STTP-Net), which only updates the model parameters to the centralized server without any private data. Firstly, we design a sub-area division method, which divides the road network into sub-areas with different macroscopic fundamental diagram properties. Then, we propose a local training model for each sub-area, which uses the graph attention network (GAT) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture the spatio-temporal dependence of the road network. The model uses the branch structure to predict the traffic volume of each intersection in the sub-area. Finally, the local models are aggregated based on federated learning to form a powerful central model, which bridges the constraints on global data sharing and privacy guarantee. We conduct experiments on the real-life dataset in Xuchang Lotus Lake 5G automated vehicles demonstration area to demonstrate that F-STTP-Net can achieve excellent prediction performance without the interaction of sub-area raw data. In addition, the proposed model has a strong generalization ability and can be quickly transferred to a new sub-area.

ID FRAMEWORK; CNN
AB Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been demonstrated to be a promising framework in investigating non-Euclidean dependency in hyperspectral (HS) images. Since the extraction of inter-pixel relationships using GNNs is computationally intensive, the mainstream GNN-based HS image classification (HSIC) methods often segment original images into superpixels as nodes for further graph propagation. Nevertheless, the low representation of raw spectral signatures limits the segmentation accuracy. Moreover, the preexisting GNN-based approaches have failed to consider the importance between long-range nodes. In this article, we firstly propose a novel superpixel generate strategy, called spectral-induced aligned superpixel segmentation, which can utilize the segmentation results of HS image with raw and deep abstract spectral feature simultaneously. More specifically, the deep spectral feature is excavated by a deep autoencoder. Intuitively, two fusion strategies: minimum and maximum fusion are further explored to integrate above segmentation results. Furthermore, we propose a local aggregation and global attention block (LAGAB) by incorporating graph sample and aggregate strategy and graph transformer to hierarchically explore local and global spatial features. Note that due to the aggregation of node information in the local neighborhood, the further used graph transformer can adaptively model intra-neighbor information. Consequently, a network formed by LAGABs is developed for HSIC. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four highly regarded HS data sets reveal that the proposed method exhibits promising classification performance.

ID LOW-RANK; SELF-REPRESENTATION
AB Multiview clustering (MVC), which can dexterously uncover the underlying intrinsic clustering structures of the data, has been particularly attractive in recent years. However, previous methods are designed for either complete or incomplete multiview only, without a unified framework that handles both tasks simultaneously. To address this issue, we propose a unified framework to efficiently tackle both tasks in approximately linear complexity, which integrates tensor learning to explore the inter-view low-rankness and dynamic anchor learning to explore the intra-view low-rankness for scalable clustering (TDASC). Specifically, TDASC efficiently learns smaller view-specific graphs by anchor learning, which not only explores the diversity embedded in multiview data, but also yields approximately linear complexity. Meanwhile, unlike most current approaches that only focus on pair-wise relationships, the proposed TDASC incorporates multiple graphs into an inter-view low-rank tensor, which elegantly models the high-order correlations across views and further guides the anchor learning. Extensive experiments on both complete and incomplete multiview datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TDASC compared with several state-of-the-art techniques.

AB The synchronization problem of the coupled delayed inertial neural networks (DINNs) with stochastic delayed impulses is studied. Based on the properties of stochastic impulses and the definition of average impulsive interval (AII), some synchronization criteria of the considered DINNs are obtained in this article. In addition, compared with previous related works, the requirement on the relationship among the impulsive time intervals, system delays, and impulsive delays is removed. Furthermore, the potential effect of impulsive delay is studied by rigorous mathematical proof. It is shown that within a certain range, the larger the impulsive delay, the faster the system converges. Numerical examples are provided to show the correctness of the theoretical results.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Time series extrinsic regression (TSER) aims at predicting numeric values based on the knowledge of the entire time series. The key to solving the TSER problem is to extract and use the most representative and contributed information from raw time series. To build a regression model that focuses on those information suitable for the extrinsic regression characteristic, there are two major issues to be addressed. That is, how to quantify the contributions of those information extracted from raw time series and then how to focus the attention of the regression model on those critical information to improve the model's regression performance. In this article, a multitask learning framework called temporal-frequency auxiliary task (TFAT) is designed to solve the mentioned problems. To explore the integral information from the time and frequency domains, we decompose the raw time series into multiscale subseries in various frequencies via a deep wavelet decomposition network. To address the first problem, the transformer encoder with the multihead self-attention mechanism is integrated in our TFAT framework to quantify the contribution of temporal-frequency information. To address the second problem, an auxiliary task in a manner of self-supervised learning is proposed to reconstruct the critical temporal-frequency features so as to focusing the regression model's attention on those essential information for facilitating TSER performance. We estimated three kinds of attention distribution on those temporal-frequency features to perform auxiliary task. To evaluate the performances of our method under various application scenarios, the experiments are carried out on the 12 datasets of the TSER problem. Also, ablation studies are used to examine the effectiveness of our method.

AB This article addresses the stabilization and synchronization problems of coupled neural networks (NNs) via an impulsive adaptive control (IAC) strategy. Unlike the traditional fixed-gain-based impulsive methods, a novel discrete-time-based adaptive updating law for the impulsive gain is designed to maintain the stabilization and synchronization performance of the coupled NNs, where the adaptive generator only intermittently updates its data at the impulsive instants. Several stabilization and synchronization criteria for the coupled NNs are established based on the impulsive adaptive feedback protocols. Additionally, the corresponding convergence analysis are also provided. Finally, the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results is illustrated using two comparison simulation examples.

AB Background: Proper maintenance of hypnosis is crucial for ensuring the safety of patients undergoing surgery. Accordingly, indicators, such as the Bispectral index (BIS), have been developed to monitor hypnotic levels. However, the black-box nature of the algorithm coupled with the hardware makes it challenging to understand the underlying mechanisms of the algorithms and integrate them with other monitoring systems, thereby limiting their use.Objective: We propose an interpretable deep learning model that forecasts BIS values 25 s in advance using 30 s electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Material and methods: The proposed model utilized EEG data as a predictor, which is then decomposed into amplitude and phase components using fast Fourier Transform. An attention mechanism was applied to interpret the importance of these components in predicting BIS. The predictability of the model was evaluated on both regression and binary classification tasks, where the former involved predicting a continuous BIS value, and the latter involved classifying a dichotomous status at a BIS value of 60. To evaluate the interpretability of the model, we analyzed the attention values expressed in the amplitude and phase components according to five ranges of BIS values. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using datasets collected from two separate medical institutions.Results and conclusion: The proposed model achieved excellent performance on both the internal and external validation datasets. The model achieved a root-mean-square error of 6.614 for the regression task, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.937 for the binary classification task. Interpretability analysis provided insight into the relationship between EEG frequency components and BIS values. Specifically, the attention mechanism revealed that higher BIS values were associated with increased amplitude attention values in high-frequency bands and increased phase attention values in various frequency bands. This finding is expected to facilitate a more profound understanding of the BIS prediction mechanism, thereby contributing to the advancement of anesthesia technologies.

In this study, the expertize recommendations and public opinion are well taken in context of debatable Pegasus issue in the Indian political, bureaucratic and democratic aspects. The problem has been addressed and resolved by using the integrated methodology of Analytical Network Process (ANP) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) strategies. Here, we have optimized the weight factors and the gradation values of the decision makers as well as the sub-criteria of each criterion using Linear Programming (LP) model. Finally, we have performed the comparative analysis from various aspects to justify the reliability of our results.

AB An alternative new method for solving an epistemic uncertainty such as fuzzy-based linear programming problem with equality constraints has been proposed here. In this approach, the optimal solution of the considered fuzzy problem has been achieved by solving a related crisp problem. Moreover, the objective function of the crisp problem has been obtained by taking the linear combination of the fuzzified version of the original uncertain objective function. The coefficients of the linear combination are considered as strictly positive real numbers. And the constraints of the crisp problem are obtained equivalently from the equality constraints of the fuzzy problem. Triangular fuzzy numbers are considered for this analysis. Comparisons have been made with the results of Kumar et al. (Appl Math Model 35:817-823, 2011), Najafi and Edalatpanah (Appl Math Model 37:7865-7867, 2013), Ezzati et al.

AB Renewable energy plays an important role in the power mix of India being sustainable and environmental source of energy. In this study, modified fuzzy Q-learning (MFQL)-based solar radiation forecasting has been proposed to forecast 30-min-ahead solar irradiance. Application of MFQL is novel in this field, as it uses reinforcement learning and model-free environment. Raw data have been collected for four Indian cities in the state of Rajasthan, i.e. Jodhpur, Ajmer, Jaipur and Kota via the data portal of National Institute of Wind Energy and Wind Resource (NIWE). Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been used as the data pre-processing technique, and relevant features are extracted from Pearson's correlation coefficient. The results obtained from the MFQL forecaster are promising with forecasting accuracy of 92.38% for winter, 93.73% for summer, 91.54% for monsoon and 92.05% for autumn season for the city of Ajmer, and similar results have been obtained for other cities as well. MFQL lends itself as an effective tool for forecasting of seasonal solar irradiance. Proposed prediction model can be effectively utilized for solar irradiance forecasting and for optimal generation of power from incident solar radiation.

AB When people interact, their behavior tends to become synchronized, a mutual coordination process that fosters short-term adaptations, like increased affiliation, and long-term adaptations, like increased bonding. This paper addresses for the first time how such short-term and long-term adaptivity induced by synchronization can be modeled computationally by a second-order multi-adaptive neural agent model. It addresses movement, affect and verbal modalities and both intrapersonal synchrony and interpersonal synchrony. The behavior of the introduced neural agent model was evaluated in a simulation paradigm with different stimuli and communication-enabling conditions. Moreover, in this paper, mathematical analysis is also addressed for adaptive network models and their positioning within the landscape of adaptive dynamical systems. The first type of analysis addressed shows that any smooth adaptive dynamical system has a canonical representation by a self-modeling network. This implies theoretically that the self-modeling network format is widely applicable, which also has been found in many practical applications using this approach. Furthermore, stationary point and equilibrium analysis was addressed and applied to the introduced self-modeling network model. It was used to obtain verification of the model providing evidence that the implemented model is correct with respect to its design specifications.

TI Software Testing Integration-Based Model (I-BM) Framework for

AB In software development, the software testing phase is an important process in determining the quality level of the software. Software testing is a process of executing a program aimed at finding errors in module access, units, and involves the execution of the system being tested on a number of test inputs, and determining whether the output produced is correct. In this study, a model-based testing (MBT) called integration-based model (I-BM) framework will be developed. This I-BM framework integrates testing variables from several software testing methods, namely black-box testing, white-box testing, unit testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. The integrated variables are function, interface, structure, performance, requirement, documentation, positives, and negatives. Then, this framework will document software errors to form a dataset, which will be measured for the level of accuracy of expected manual fault output using neural network algorithm and support vector machine. From the experiment results, it shows that the accuracy level of predicting fault output values from the I-BM framework using the neural network algorithm is on average 80%, and it produces a superior SVM architecture model in predicting I-BM framework output errors with an accuracy value of 0.99, precision of 0.99, recall of 0.99, and F1-score of 0.99. Compared to other MBT, the IBM framework has the advantage of being a more comprehensive software testing model because it starts from the identification of problems, analysis, design, documentation of software testing, and recommendations for each fault output found. Thus, software errors can be classified systematically in the form of a dataset, and not only focus on software testing for product lines and module mappings.

AB Currently, evaluating the quality of strong-flavor Baijiu (SFB) heavily relies on subjective sensory analysis, resulting in large deviations in evaluation. However, as there are no existing evaluation criteria for SFB quality, this study aimed to extract trace components and design an evaluation model using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). First, the key component data was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) to identify the most important principal components that represent the SFB samples. Second, KNN, DT, SVM, and BP analyses were then employed on the principal component data to determine the grade of the SFB samples. Finally, a price prediction model based on SPCA+BP was established to objectively evaluate the quality and price of SFB. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively realize the distinction and price prediction of SFB.

AB Braille is a tactile writing/reading system used by people who are visually impaired. Traditionally, Braille has been used on static surfaces like books, signs or keypads, refreshable Braille displays are also available to be used as an interface for digital devices. The linear Braille alphabet proposed in this paper is a novel method to represent Braille characters using the vibration engine of a mobile device operated via vibro-tactile signal sequences. The standard vibration engine is driven to generate different haptic effects on the mobile device in a predefined sequence. Two different tests for distinguishing distinct sequences and characters were conducted over a subject group of 50 clear sighted people. Result of this test show that; signal distinguishability of the method is 99%, and character distinguishability is 97%, while maximum duration for a single character is 1050 ms. A second test on 10 visually impaired users presented a signal distinguishability result of 90% and a character distinguishability result of 82.5%. The method proposed in this paper shows promising results for representing Braillecharacters on a standard mobile device.

   graph embeddings; Machine learning
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning architectures that apply graph convolutions through message-passing processes between nodes, represented as embeddings. GNNs have recently become popular because of their ability to obtain a contextual representation of each node taking into account information from its surroundings. However, existing work has focused on the development of GNN architectures, using basic domain-specific information about the nodes to compute embeddings. Meanwhile, in the closely-related area of knowledge graphs, much effort has been put towards developing deep learning techniques to obtain node embeddings that preserve information about relationships and structure without relying on domain-specific data. The potential application of deep embeddings of knowledge graphs in GNNs remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we carry out a number of experiments to answer open research questions about the impact on GNNs performance when combined with deep embeddings. We test 7 different deep embeddings across several attribute prediction tasks in two state-of-art attribute-rich datasets. We conclude that, while there is a significant performance improvement, its magnitude varies heavily depending on the specific task and deep embedding technique considered.

AB Advance signal processing techniques are becoming one of the essential requirements for secure and efficient communication in the future innovative world. These requirements are due to the tremendous advancement of various latest cutting-edge technologies that are very useful for the present generation. Marketing information system visualization is essential for the services of every advanced technology established in this way to reach people. Citing this, signal processing is a significant issue in most new technological innovations and challenges in various applications. A marketing information system, or MIS, based on these processes provides a valuable marketing method that helps marketers make better decisions. In this mode of operation, the existing methods are discarded, and the new methods, such as visual images, sound waves, and seismic waves, are implemented as digital signal processes, and their benefits are used as inputs for the processing of humankind. Based on this perspective, collaborative Management Information Systems (MIS) is proposed. This process-based bridge enables MIS professionals to benefit from their investments in personnel, equipment, and business processes. In particular, transportation challenges such as total order intensity ratio, rising fuel prices, unexpected delays in transportation, shortage of skilled workers, deplorable warehouse conditions, insufficient and over-stressed delivery staff, etc., and how road transport is giving its full attention to these fluctuations. Research paper explains very clearly and adequately explains the impact of such explained traffic problems, such as the volume of traffic and passengers, road network, lack of rehabilitation of half of the roads, and lack of national highways. Performance analysis for MIS measures with various factors is taken, and how the process varies in them and the answers to them are clarified through this research. This research citation shows how the marketing performance of an MIS measures the best practices in this research. Through this, online marketing performance based on MIS measures can be increased through MIS analysis reports for MIS measures. Finally, the Performance of the proposed MIS-Transport with the MIS-hospital Industry is taken as an example and explained.

AB Video Analytics is widely used by the internet-based platforms to govern the mass consumption of videos. Traditionally, it is carried out from the decoded format of the videos. This requires the analytics server to perform both decoding and analytics computation. This process can be made fast and efficient if performed over the compressed format of the videos as it reduces the decoding stress over the analytics server. The field of video analytics from the binarized formats using modern deep learning techniques is still emerging and needs further exploration. This proposed work is based on the same notion. In this work, two analytics tasks that is, classification and object detection are carried out from the binarized videos. The binarized formats are produced by using an already-designed end-to-end video compression network. The experiments have been carried out over standard datasets. The proposed MobileNetv2-based classification network shows an accuracy of 66% over the YouTube UGC dataset and the YOLOX-S-based detection network shows mAP of 45% over IMAGENet datasets. The proposed work shows competitiveness and improvement in the detection outcomes on compressed data and also provides further motivation for the adoption of deep learning-based video compression in practical analytics domains.

AB Given the challenge of pear leaf disease recognition caused by uneven illumination, overlapping leaves, and other green plants in the background, a two-stage strategy-based framework for pear leaf segmentation and disease classification is proposed. Initially, a double branch polymerization net fusing features of the low-level feature branch and semantic branch is constructed to extract the target diseased pear leaf and eliminate background interference. Then an improved lightweight neural network (Inverted-Inception Efficient-Excitation-and-Filtering-Bottleneck MobileNet-v2, I(2)EMv2) is used to capture multi-scale lesion information and ainhibit invalid feature channels and filter redundant features for the final classification. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can accurately extract the pear leaf region with complete boundary from the complex background, maximize the retention of lesion information, and achieve high-precision pear leaf disease identification. The mean absolute error, F-measure, and intersection over union of leaf segmentation are 0.027, 0.947, and 0.880, respectively, and the average recognition accuracy of leaf disease is 92.05%. Compared with others, the method proposed in this paper has superior performance on segmentation and classification, which provides a reference for pear leaf disease classification under complex background.

AB The attention mechanism has produced impressive results in object tracking, but for a good trade-off between performance and efficiency, CNN-based approaches still dominate, owing to quadratic complexity of attention. Here, the SGF module is proposed, an efficient feature fusion block for effective object tracking with reduced linear complexity of attention. The proposed method fuses feature with attention in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the low-resolution semantic branch, the top K regions with highest attention scores are selected; in the high-resolution detail branch, attention is only calculated within regions corresponding to the top K regions. Thus, the features from the high-resolution branch can be efficiently fused under the guidance of low-resolution branch. Experiments on RGB and RGB-T datasets with reformed FairMOT and MDNet+RGBT trackers demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In real-world applications, audio surveillance is often performed by large models that can detect many types of anomalies. However, typical approaches are based on centralized solutions characterized by significant issues related to privacy and data transport costs. In addition, the large size of these models prevented a shift to contexts with limited resources, such as edge devices computing. In this work we propose conv-SPAD, a method for convolutional SPectral audio-based Anomaly Detection that takes advantage of common tools for spectral analysis and a simple autoencoder to learn the underlying condition of normality of real scenarios. Using audio data collected from real scenarios and artificially corrupted with anomalous sound events, we test the ability of the proposed model to learn normal conditions and detect anomalous events. It shows performances in line with larger models, often outperforming them. Moreover, the model's small size makes it usable in contexts with limited resources, such as edge devices hardware.

AB This article proposes two approaches for a tailored geometrical deviation compensation for Laser-Powder-Bed-Fusion production. The deviation compensation is performed by a non-rigid deformation of the manufacturing geometry in each iteration to reduce the geometrical deviations from the target geometry. It is important for geometric compensation approaches to separate deterministic deviations from random scatter, since compensating scatter can result in unstable behaviour. In order to compensate only deterministic deviations two novel approaches for a local estimation of the scatter are successfully introduced and tested using a hybrid model of a series production cycle.

AB Automatic micro-defect detection is crucial for promoting efficiency in the production lines of patterned OLED panels. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged as promising solutions for micro-defect detection. However, in real-world industrial scenarios, the scarcity of training data or annotations results in a drop in performance. A multi-stage few-shot micro-defect detection approach is proposed for patterned OLED panels to deal with this problem. Firstly, we introduce a converter from defective to defect-free images based on our redesigned Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), aiming to inpaint defects with normal textures. Next, we exploit a region-growing method with automatic seed points to obtain the defect's segmentation and geometric parameters in each image block. Reliable seed points are provided by structural similarity index maps between defective sub-blocks and reconstructed reference. Finally, a multi-scale Siamese neural network is proposed to identify the category of extracted defects. With our proposed approach, detection and classification results of defects can be obtained successively. Our experimental results on samples at different array processes demonstrate the superb adaptability of VQ-VAE, with a defect detection rate ranging from 90.0% to 96.0%. Additionally, compared with existing classification models, our multi-scale Siamese neural network exhibits an impressive 98.6% classification accuracy for a long-tailed defect dataset without overfitting. In summary, the proposed approach shows great potential for practical micro-defect detection in industrial scenarios with limited training data.

AB The topic of comprehensibility of machine-learned theories has recently drawn increasing attention. Inductive logic programming uses logic programming to derive logic theories from small data based on abduction and induction techniques. Learned theories are represented in the form of rules as declarative descriptions of obtained knowledge. In earlier work, the authors provided the first evidence of a measurable increase in human comprehension based on machine-learned logic rules for simple classification tasks. In a later study, it was found that the presentation of machine-learned explanations to humans can produce both beneficial and harmful effects in the context of game learning. We continue our investigation of comprehensibility by examining the effects of the ordering of concept presentations on human comprehension. In this work, we examine the explanatory effects of curriculum order and the presence of machine-learned explanations for sequential problem-solving. We show that (1) there exist tasks A and B such that learning A before learning B results in better comprehension for humans in comparison to learning B before learning A and (2) there exist tasks A and B such that the presence of explanations when learning A contributes to improved human comprehension when subsequently learning B. We propose a framework for the effects of sequential teaching on comprehension based on an existing definition of comprehensibility and provide evidence for support from data collected in human trials. Our empirical study involves curricula that teach novices the merge sort algorithm. Our results show that sequential teaching of concepts with increasing complexity (a) has a beneficial effect on human comprehension and (b) leads to human re-discovery of divide-and-conquer problem-solving strategies, and (c) allows adaptations of human problem-solving strategy with better performance when machine-learned explanations are also presented.

AB Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the traffic, planning for autonomous driving (AD) on highway is challenging. Traditional planning algorithms have the problems of low and unstable efficiency, which reduces the real-time performance of the autonomous vehicle (AV). Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an emerging and promising method that has achieved amazing performance in many fields. In this paper, we propose a novel planning approach based on soft actor critic (SAC) with hybrid actions. The algorithm takes the structured information of the ego vehicle and the surroundings as input, and generates a termination state on the Frenet space for ego vehicle, then a feasible and continuous spatiotemporal trajectory will be output by a polynomial planner based on the intermediate state. Different from other sampling-based planning methods, only single polynomial planning is required, which improves planning efficiency significantly. Experiments show that DRL agent with hybrid actions is more secure than the agents with only continuous or discrete actions. Compared with other planning methods, the proposed algorithm has the least and most robust time for planning in different scenarios.

AB Meta learning aims to endow models with the ability to quickly learn new tasks based on existing knowledge. However, recent works have relied on complex structures and prior information to improve performance on few-shot tasks. To this end, we propose MetaCL, a meta learning architecture that uses only a traditional backbone without any priors. MetaCL takes distorted versions of an episode of samples as input and outputs predictions respectively. Besides, we introduce an unsupervised loss to minimize component redundancy and maximize variability, achieving soft-whitening and soft-alignment constraints. We evaluate MetaCL on few-shot tasks of image classification datasets CUB and miniImageNet, and experimetal results proves that MetaCL outperforms other meta-learning methods. MetaCL can be treated as a simple yet effective baseline and also be easily integrated into other few-shot models for additional performance gains.

AB Feature selection and hyper-parameters optimization (tuning) are two of the most important and challenging tasks in machine learning. To achieve satisfying performance, every machine learning model has to be adjusted for a specific problem, as the efficient universal approach does not exist. In addition, most of the data sets contain irrelevant and redundant features that can even have a negative influence on the model's performance. Machine learning can be applied almost everywhere; however, due to the high risks involved with the growing number of malicious, phishing websites on the world wide web, feature selection and tuning are in this research addressed for this particular problem. Notwithstanding that many metaheuristics have been devised for both feature selection and machine learning tuning challenges, there is still much space for improvements. Therefore, the research exhibited in this manuscript tries to improve phishing website detection by tuning extreme learning model that utilizes the most relevant subset of phishing websites data sets features. To accomplish this goal, a novel diversity-oriented social network search algorithm has been developed and incorporated into a two-level cooperative framework. The proposed algorithm has been compared to six other cutting-edge metaheuristics algorithms, that were also implemented in the framework and tested under the same experimental conditions. All metaheuristics have been employed in level 1 of the devised framework to perform the feature selection task. The best-obtained subset of features has then been used as the input to the framework level 2, where all algorithms perform tuning of extreme learning machine. Tuning is referring to the number of neurons in the hidden layers and weights and biases initialization. For evaluation purposes, three phishing websites data sets of different sizes and the number of classes, retrieved from UCI and Kaggle repositories, were employed and all methods are compared in terms of classification error, separately for layers 1 and 2 over several independent runs, and detailed metrics of the final outcomes (output of layer 2), including precision, recall, f1 score, receiver operating characteristics and precision-recall area under the curves. Furthermore, an additional experiment is also conducted, where only layer 2 of the proposed framework is used, to establish metaheuristics performance for extreme machine learning tuning with all features, which represents a large-scale NP-hard global optimization challenge. Finally, according to the results of statistical tests, final research findings suggest that the proposed diversity-oriented social network search metaheuristics on average obtains better achievements than competitors for both challenges and all data sets. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis of the best-performing model was applied to determine the most influential features.

TI Global-local transformer for single-image rain removal
SO PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Deep leaning; Single-image deraining; Transformer; Self-attention
AB Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success on single-image rain removal task. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, CNN-based models generally demonstrate limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformer has achieved milestones in many artificial intelligence fields by mitigating the shortcomings of CNNs but can result in limited localization abilities and high computational cost. To this end, we propose a novel global-local transformer, termed GLFormer to model long-range dependencies for rain removal while remaining efficient. Specifically, we use a window-based local transformer block to build the shallow layers of GLFormer for processing high-resolution feature maps, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. And a global transformer block is designed to construct deep layers which can model long-range dependencies with global self-attention. Powered by these designs, GLFormer avoids the limitation of computing self-attention within a local window that lacks global feature inference and reduces the computational effort to a large extent. Considering that local details are crucial for the recovery of degraded images, we further employ convolution operation in both global and local transformer blocks to improve its potential for capturing local context. In addition, a self-supervised pre-training strategy is further introduced to mining sufficient image priors by utilizing ultra-large unlabeled image datasets. Our proposed method is extensively evaluated on several benchmark datasets, and the results show GLFormer to be superior than the state-of-the-art approaches built upon convolution.

ID NETWORK ANALYSIS
AB With the ever-growing accessibility of case law online, it has become challenging to manually identify case law relevant to one's legal issue. In the Netherlands, the planned increase in the online publication of case law is expected to exacerbate this challenge. In this paper, we tried to predict whether court decisions are cited by other courts or not after being published, thus in a way distinguishing between more and less authoritative cases. This type of system may be used to process the large amounts of available data by filtering out large quantities of non-authoritative decisions, thus helping legal practitioners and scholars to find relevant decisions more easily, and drastically reducing the time spent on preparation and analysis. For the Dutch Supreme Court, the match between our prediction and the actual data was relatively strong (with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.60). Our results were less successful for the Council of State and the district courts (MCC scores of 0.26 and 0.17, relatively). We also attempted to identify the most informative characteristics of a decision. We found that a completely explainable model, consisting only of handcrafted metadata features, performs almost as well as a less well-explainable system based on all text of the decision.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) primarily affects a set of lesions in the eyes, causing retinal degeneration and loss of vision. The DR features serve as a crucial component for ophthalmologists to diagnose DR at an earlier stage. This paper presents an automatic DR screening tool using a hybrid GAN-RCNN architecture formulated to categorize and identify different DR grades from the fundus images captured at various resolutions. The hybrid GAN-RCNN architecture is formulated by replacing the discriminator in the GAN with the RCNN classifier. The RCNN model can handle the complex inter-class and intra-class variations present in the fundus retina images and classify them into different classes such as mild, moderate, severe, and nonproliferative DR. The RCNN model not only extracts the pixels present in the fundus image but also focuses on the significant relationship that exists between different DR classes. The Archimedes optimization Algorithm (AOA) is used to optimize the different GAN and RCNN hyperparameters. When compared to the existing techniques the proposed model offers an accuracy of 99%, 98.5%, and 99.4% in the APTOS, Kaggle, and Messidor datasets which is comparatively high. The experimental outcome reveals that the introduced model serves as a concrete baseline for the diagnosis and treatment of DR patients.

AB This paper proposes a robust localization system using complementary information extracted from ceiling and ground plans, particularly applicable to dynamic and complex environments. The ceiling perception provides the robot with stable and time-invariant environmental features independent of the dynamic changes on the ground, whereas the ground perception allows the robot to navigate in the ground plane while avoiding stationary obstacles. We propose an architecture to fuse ground 2D LiDAR scan and ceiling 3D LiDAR scan with our enhanced mapping algorithm associating perception from both sources efficiently. The localization ability and the navigation performance can be promisingly secured even in a harsh environment with our complementary sensed information from the ground and ceiling. The salient feature of our work is that our system can simultaneously map both the ceiling and ground plane efficiently without extra efforts of deploying articulated landmarks and apply such hybrid information effectively, which facilitates the robot to travel through any indoor environment with human crowds without getting lost.

AB The practical applications of social media have raised the bar for real-time event detection all over the globe. It has been deemed useful for extracting important data that enables people across the world to access information within mere seconds of its occurrence. Among the many use cases of the aforementioned applications lies detection of issues regarding the smooth mobility of traffic on the road. Machine learning models that were developed earlier used support vector machines with Bag of Words. However, BoW (Bag of Words) suffers from problems such as the inability to manage semantic relationships between words, limited representation, and high dimensional representation. Our model developed for a similar cause fetches the required data from Twitter to make the target authorities aware of the issues like potholes, accidents, and high traffic density (congestion) of the Chandigarh tri-city area. The data collected then undergoes multiple stages of pre-processing. After that, multiple word embedding models come into play to build semantic relationships between the words and intra software jargon. The resultant is then processed through the several recently introduced deep learning based natural language processing. The current study aims to perform a comparative evaluation of the several advanced state-of-the-art classification models at the target traffic event detection activity. The developed models make a fact-based prediction to make multi-class classification into the aforementioned categories. From the comparative evaluation, it has been observed that the proposed language processing model (RoBERTa based) pipeline outperforms the existing approaches and is 97% accurate at classifying the real-time tweets. Moreover, the proposed pipeline achieves 96% recall at segregating the traffic events efficiently.

ID EVOLUTIONARY
AB The recently proposed Coati Optimization Algorithm (COA) is one of the swarm-based intelligence algorithms. In this study, the current COA algorithm is developed and Enhanced COA (ECOA) is proposed. There is an imbalance between the exploitation and exploration capabilities of the COA. To balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of COA in the search space, the algorithm has been improved with two modifications. These modifications are those that preserve population diversity for a longer period of time during local and global searches. Thus, some of the drawbacks of COA in search strategies are eliminated. The achievements of COA and ECOA were tested in four different test groups. COA and ECOA were first compared on twenty-three classic CEC functions in three different dimensions (10, 20, and 30). Later, ECOA was tested on CEC-2017 with twenty-nine functions and on CEC-2020 with ten functions, and its success was demonstrated in different dimensions (5, 10, and 30). Finally, ECOA has been shown to be successful in different cycles (300, 500, and 1000) on Big Data Optimization Problems (BOP), which have high dimensions. Friedman and Wilcoxon tests were performed on the results, and the obtained results were analyzed in detail. According to the results, ECOA outperformed COA in all comparisons performed. In order to prove the success of ECOA, seven newly proposed algorithms (EMA, FHO, SHO, HBA, SMA, SOA, and JAYA) were selected from the literature in the last few years and compared with ECOA and COA. In the classical test functions, ECOA achieved the best results, surpassing all other algorithms when compared. It achieved the second-best results in CEC-2020 test functions and entered the top four in CEC-2017 and BOP test functions. According to the results, ECOA can be used as an alternative algorithm for solving small, medium, and large-scale continuous optimization problems.

AB Smart healthcare applications cannot be separated from healthcare data analysis and the interactive interpretability between data and model. A human-in-the-loop active learning approach is introduced to reduce the cost of healthcare data labelling by evaluating the information quality of unlabelled medical data and then screening the high informative samples. Specifically, focused on the extracted feature tensor of medical images, a new evaluation metric was proposed, called local feature information distance. Then, the whole feature information distance between two images can be obtained by seeking optimal matching of local feature information correlation based on the feature spatial traversal. Further, the feature information distance entropy (FIDE) method was proposed from the perspective of feature spatial distribution, which outperformed other related works. Many comparison and ablation experiments were carried out; the results showed that the proposed method can well distinguish the information quality of the unlabelled samples even facing different datasets. The stability, robustness, and generalisation of the proposed method were verified. Thus, this study provides some inspirations for healthcare data analysis and efficient management, such as eliminating redundancy and selective annotation.

AB Conventional RGB-T salient object detection treats RGB and thermal modalities equally to locate the common salient regions. However, the authors observed that the rich colour and texture information of the RGB modality makes the objects more prominent compared to the background; and the thermal modality records the temperature difference of the scene, so the objects usually contain clear and continuous edge information. In this work, a novel mirror-complementary Transformer network (MCNet) is proposed for RGB-T SOD, which supervise the two modalities separately with a complementary set of saliency labels under a symmetrical structure. Moreover, the attention-based feature interaction and serial multiscale dilated convolution (SDC)-based feature fusion modules are introduced to make the two modalities complement and adjust each other flexibly. When one modality fails, the proposed model can still accurately segment the salient regions. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model under challenging scenes in real world, the authors build a novel RGB-T SOD dataset VT723 based on a large public semantic segmentation RGB-T dataset used in the autonomous driving domain. Extensive experiments on benchmark and VT723 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including CNN-based and Transformer-based methods.

AB Deep learning algorithms represented by convolutional neural networks bring new opportunities for spectral analysis technology. Convolutional neural networks are more straightforward than traditional chemometric algorithms for detecting the quality of agricultural products, reducing the procedures of spectral preprocessing and band selection, and with higher prediction accuracy. However, there are few research papers on the relevance of the explanation of the convolutional neural networks model mechanism, and the reader cannot fully understand convolutional neural networks feature learning. In this study, convolutional neural networks combined with the subregional voting method were used to predict the moisture content of semen ziziphi spinosae. Firstly, 10 regions of interest were divided using the subregional voting method, and the results of network models were compared. It was found that the average spectrum of the fifth region of interest had the best prediction of moisture content because it was closest to the central region of semen ziziphi spinosae. Based on this, a convolutional neural network containing three convolutional layers, three pooling layers, and one fully connected layer is proposed. Partial least squares regression, backpropagation neural network, and convolutional neural networks were established to predict the moisture content of semen ziziphi spinosae. The correlation coefficient of the prediction set of the partial least squares regression is 0.98 after the multiplicative scatter correction preprocessed the spectra, and correlation coefficient of the prediction set of the backpropagation neural network is 0.83 after the standard normal variate preprocessed the spectra. The correlation coefficient of the prediction set of the convolutional neural networks established by using the raw spectra reached 0.99. The spectral preprocessing method can improve the prediction set correlation coefficient of partial least squares regression and backpropagation neural network. Still, it will reduce the prediction ability of convolutional neural networks. This study also analyzed the effect of different learning rates on the performance of convolutional neural networks, and it was found that the training loss and training accuracy performed most consistently when the learning rate was 0.01. Secondly, this study also visualized the output feature maps of the three convolutional layers of convolutional neural networks and verified the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks feature band extraction. This study provides new ideas for deep learning in the online detection of seed moisture content.

ID VARIABLE SELECTION
AB In the context of global sustainable development, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment has become a frontier topic in the field of asset management. This paper focuses on ESG-valued multi-period portfolio selection problem which incorporates ESG factor into traditional portfolio optimization. Using ESG-valued returns instead of traditional returns, we propose an ESG-valued fused LASSO model to promote an optimal sparse multi-period portfolio strategy. The objective of the model is to minimize a combination of returns and risks with respect to ESG ratings based on classical Markowitz mean-variance framework. The sparsity of the portfolio at each period and the turnover across periods is achieved by the l(1) regularization approach. To improve the out-of-sample performance of the ESG-valued model, we introduce two machine learning methods, namely random forest and support vector regression, to predict the ESG-valued returns. We develop a symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers to solve the regularized optimization model. Additionally, some other sparsity-driven penalty functions are discussed which results in a general framework of multi-period portfolio optimization. Finally, numerical experiments on several real datasets from both in-sample and out-of-sample demonstrate the positive effect of ESG in multi-period portfolio optimization.

ID BEARING
AB Due to the growing interest for increasing productivity and cost reduction in industrial environment, new techniques for monitoring rotating machinery are emerging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the approaches that has been proposed to analyze the collected data (e.g., vibration signals) providing a diagnosis of the asset's operating condition. Three major problems hinder the application of AI models in industrial environments, being the motivation for the research: (i) impossibility or long time to obtain a sample of all operational conditions (since faults rarely happen), (ii) high cost of experts to label all acquired data (in a supervised scenario) and (iii) lack of interpretability of the models (black-boxes). To overcome these problems, a new generic and interpretable approach for classifying faults in rotating machinery based on transfer learning from augmented synthetic data to real rotating machinery is here proposed, namely FaultD-XAI (Fault Diagnosis using eXplainable AI). To provide scalability using transfer learning, synthetic vibration signals are created mimicking the characteristic behavior of failures in operation. The application of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) with 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN) allows the post hoc interpretation of results, supporting the user in decision making and increasing diagnostic confidence. The proposed approach not only obtained promising diagnostic performance but was also able to learn characteristics used by experts to identify conditions in a source domain and apply them in another target domain. The experimental results obtained on three datasets containing different mechanical faults suggest the method offers a promising approach on exploiting transfer learning, synthetic data and explainable artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis. Lastly, to guarantee reproducibility and foster research in the field, the developed dataset is made publicly available.

AB Steel tubes are known as "the vessels of industry" and widely used in oil exploration, drilling, aerospace and other fields. This study focuses on cold-drawn seamless steel tubes, aiming to reduce the high logistics cost and improve the low efficiency in production. This study models three stages of heat treatment, cold drawing, and finishing as a multi-stage distributed reentrant hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (MSDRHFSP). First, a multiobjective optimization model is established to minimize makespan and transferring cost. Second, an improved multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with local search (IMOEA/D-LS) is proposed. The balanced decoding method according to the similarity degree of the jobs (BDMASDJ) is developed to trade off the two objectives. Crossover and mutation operators suitable for MSDRHFSP are designed, and a local search operator is performed. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted and the results show that IMOEA/D-LS can solve the MSDRHFSP effectively.

AB Text augmentation is a popular technique in natural language processing (NLP) that has been shown to improve the performance of various downstream tasks. The goal of text augmentation is to generate additional training data from existing data, thereby increasing the amount of data available for training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to text augmentation that combines the power of graph-based neural networks and genetic algorithms. Our proposed scheme, called GTR-GA, is designed to generate diverse and high-quality augmented text data by exploring the high-dimensional feature space of text data using graph-based neural networks and genetic algorithms. Our approach utilizes a graph attention network (GAT) based model, called HetGAPN, to learn node representations in a heterogeneous graph representing text data. We introduce the concept of node aggregation and bidirectional attention in HetGAPN to better capture the relationships between different features of the input text data. We then use a genetic algorithm to generate a diverse set of candidate embeddings that explore different parts of the input space. Our approach uses perplexity as the objective function to evaluate the quality of the augmented text data generated by each candidate embedding. The most fit candidate embeddings are selected as parents, and crossover and mutation operators are used to generate a new population of candidate embeddings. Our experimental results show that GTR-GA is capable of generating highquality augmented text data that improves the performance of various downstream NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis and text classification. The proposed scheme can be applied to a wide range of NLP tasks and can help overcome the data scarcity problem that is often encountered in NLP.

DE Trajectory prediction; Hierarchical policy; Graph neural networks
ID ATTENTION
AB In complex and dynamic urban traffic scenarios, the accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding pedes-trians with interactive behaviors plays a vital role in the self-driving system. Intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors will inevitably influence the pedestrians trajectory. Intrinsic factors such as pedestrians diversified intentions bring rich and diverse multi-modal future possibilities. Besides, extrinsic factors affecting the future trajectory are accompanied by context semantics such as interactions among pedestrians. However, most of the existing methods discuss two problems (interaction and intention) separately. Considering both two factors impact the trajectory of pedestrians, a Triple Policies Fused Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (Tri-HGNN) is proposed to model spatial and temporal interactions and intentions among the whole scene of pedestrians at each time step and predict the multiple future trajectories. Tri-HGNN con-tains three different policies: (i) Extrinsic-level policy is used to extract spatial nodes embedding from the interaction graph of pedestrian trajectories by using the Graph Attention Network. (ii) Intrinsic-level policy adopts the Graph Convolutional Network to infer the human intention for more accurate predic-tion. Moreover, human intention is influenced by the intrinsic interaction generated among pedestrians, so we fuse the interaction features to grasp the influence of the extrinsic interaction. (iii) Basic-level pol-icy then integrates the heuristic information obtained from other two policies and concatenates it with historical trajectories to make multiple predictions through Temporal Convolution Network. Experimen-tal results show that our model improves performance compared with state-of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; DEEP; NETWORK
AB Deep MRI reconstruction is commonly performed with conditional models that de-alias undersampled acquisitions to recover images consistent with fully-sampled data. Since conditional models are trained with knowledge of the imaging operator, they can show poor generalization across variable operators. Unconditional models instead learn generative image priors decoupled from the operator to improve reliability against domain shifts related to the imaging operator. Recent diffusion models are particularly promising given their high sample fidelity. Nevertheless, inference with a static image prior can perform suboptimally. Here we propose the first adaptive diffusion prior for MRI reconstruction, AdaDiff, to improve performance and reliability against domain shifts. AdaDiff leverages an efficient diffusion prior trained via adversarial mapping over large reverse diffusion steps. A two-phase reconstruction is executed following training: a rapid-diffusion phase that produces an initial reconstruction with the trained prior, and an adaptation phase that further refines the result by updating the prior to minimize data-consistency loss. Demonstrations on multi-contrast brain MRI clearly indicate that AdaDiff outperforms competing conditional and unconditional methods under domain shifts, and achieves superior or on par within-domain performance.

AB Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) reasoning has attracted increasing research interest in recent years. However, most of the existing TKGs reasoning models aim to learn a dynamic entity representation by binding timestamps information with the entities, neglecting to learn adaptive entity representation that is valuable to the query from relevant historical facts. To this end, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention neTwork (HGAT) for the TKGs reasoning task. Specifically, we design a hierarchical neighbor encoder to model the time-oriented and task-oriented roles of the entities. The time-aware mechanism is developed in the first layer to differentiate the contributions of query-relevant historical facts at different timestamps to the query. The designed relation-aware attention is used in the second layer to discern the contributions of the structural neighbors of an entity. Through this hierarchical encoder, our model can absorb valuable knowledge effectively from the relevant historical facts, and thus learn more expressive adaptive entity representation for the query. Finally, we evaluate our model performance on four TKGs datasets and justify its superiority against vaerious state-of-the-art baselines. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-modality cardiac imaging plays a key role in the management of patients with cardiovascular diseases. It allows a combination of complementary anatomical, morphological and functional information, increases diagnosis accuracy, and improves the efficacy of cardiovascular interventions and clinical outcomes. Fully automated processing and quantitative analysis of multi-modality cardiac images could have a direct impact on clinical research and evidence-based patient management. However, these require overcoming significant challenges including inter-modality misalignment and finding optimal methods to integrate information from different modalities. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of multi-modality imaging in cardiology, the computing methods, the validation strategies, the related clinical workflows and future perspectives. For the computing methodologies, we have a favored focus on the three tasks, i.e., registration, fusion and segmentation, which generally involve multi-modality imaging data, either combining information from different modalities or transferring information across modalities. The review highlights that multi-modality cardiac imaging data has the potential of wide applicability in the clinic, such as trans-aortic valve implantation guidance, myocardial viability assessment, and catheter ablation therapy and its patient selection. Nevertheless, many challenges remain unsolved, such as missing modality, modality selection, combination of imaging and non-imaging data, and uniform analysis and representation of different modalities. There is also work to do in defining how the well-developed techniques fit in clinical workflows and how much additional and relevant information they introduce. These problems are likely to continue to be an active field of research and the questions to be answered in the future.

AB Over the last decade, convolutional neural networks have emerged and advanced the state-of-the-art in various image analysis and computer vision applications. The performance of 2D image classification networks is constantly improving and being trained on databases made of millions of natural images. Conversely, in the field of medical image analysis, the progress is also remarkable but has mainly slowed down due to the relative lack of annotated data and besides, the inherent constraints related to the acquisition process. These limitations are even more pronounced given the volumetry of medical imaging data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient way to transfer the efficiency of a 2D classification network trained on natural images to 2D, 3D uni-and multi-modal medical image segmentation applications. In this direction, we designed novel architectures based on two key principles: weight transfer by embedding a 2D pre-trained encoder into a higher dimensional U-Net, and dimensional transfer by expanding a 2D segmentation network into a higher dimension one. The proposed networks were tested on benchmarks comprising different modalities: MR, CT, and ultrasound images. Our 2D network ranked first on the CAMUS challenge dedicated to echo-cardiographic data segmentation and surpassed the state-of-the-art. Regarding 2D/3D MR and CT abdominal images from the CHAOS challenge, our approach largely outperformed the other 2D-based methods described in the challenge paper on Dice, RAVD, ASSD, and MSSD scores and ranked third on the online evaluation platform. Our 3D network applied to the BraTS 2022 competition also achieved promising results, reaching an average Dice score of 91.69% (91.22%) for the whole tumor, 83.23% (84.77%) for the tumor core and 81.75% (83.88%) for enhanced tumor using the approach based on weight (dimensional) transfer. Experimental and qualitative results illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for multi-dimensional medical image segmentation.

AB Video visual relation detecti on (VidVRD) is to detect visual relations among instances as well as the tra-jectories of the corresponding subjects and objects in the video. Most current works improve the accuracy of tracking the objects but neglect the other key challenge, predicting the reliable visual relations in the videos, a vital meant for downstream tasks further. In this paper, we propose a dual attentional trans-former network (VRD-DAT) for predicting the visual relations, also known as the predicates, in multi -relation videos. Specifically, our network first respectively targets modeling action visual predicates (Act-T) and spatial locating visual relations (Spa-T) via two parallel visual transformer structures simul-taneously. Then, an attentional weighting module obtains the final precise merged visual relations. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets, ImageNet-VidVRD and VidOR, to demonstrate our model is capable of outperforming other state-of-the-art methods effectively on the task of video visual relation prediction. Quantitative and qualitative results also show that with more accurate visual relations, the performance of the video visual relation detection task can be further boosted.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology has been widely used in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Nowadays, most of the existing breast ultrasound classification methods need to crop a tumor-centered image (TCI) on each image as the input of the system. These methods ignore the fact that the tumor as well as its surrounding tissues can actually be viewed from multiple aspects, and it is difficult to extract multi-resolution information applying only a single view image. In addition, the current methods do not effectively extract fine-grained features, and subtle details play an important role in breast classification. In our research, we propose a novel strategy to generate multi-resolution TCIs in a single ultrasound image, resulting in a multi-data-input learning task. Hence, a conventional single image based learning task is converted into a multi-view learning task, and an improved combined style fusion method suitable for a deep network is proposed, which integrates the advantage of the decision-based and feature-based methods to fuse the information of different views. At the same time, we first attempt to introduce the fine-grained classification method into breast classifications and capture the pairwise correlation between feature channels at each position to extract subtle information. The comparative experimental results show that our method can effectively improve the classification performance and achieves the best results in five metrics.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In spite of the extensive studies that have been conducted regarding the construction of multi-objective test problems, researchers have mainly focused their interests on designing complicated search spaces, disregarding, in many cases, the design of the Pareto optimal fronts of the problems. In this regard, the work related to scalable multi-objective test problems - i.e., problems that can be formulated for an arbitrary number of objectives - has been much less studied. This paper introduces a new set of continuous and box-constrained multi-objective test problems which are scalable in both the number of objectives and in the number of decision variables. Each test problem included in the proposed test suite has a peculiar Pareto front different from those observed in the existing scalable multi-objective test suites. In addition to different Pareto fronts, the proposed test suite introduces features related to the search space that place obstacles that complicate exploring Pareto optimal solutions. Such features can be easily switched on and off by the user to analyze specific mechanisms of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). The components used in the proposed test suite can be used as a toolkit to construct new test instances not included in this set of problems. To illustrate the use and difficulties of the proposed test suite, some experiments are presented adopting three MOEAs using selection mechanisms based on Pareto optimality, decomposition, and a performance indicator (hypervolume).

AB Spectroscopy-based methods are often used to verify the authenticity of food and feed. In the scientific environment, especially non-targeted approaches are becoming increasingly popular here, although their routine applicability, e.g., in official food control, is currently limited. The comparability of spectra acquired by different spectroscopic instruments using the same measurement principle is essential for the application of a common spectral database in laboratories and represents a current challenge in this field. In order to investigate possible approaches towards improved comparability of these spectra, a sample set of rapeseed (Brassica napus) and pumpkin seed (Cucurbita maxima) oils was analyzed using three Fourier-transform-mid-infrared spectrometers following the same procedure for sample preparation and measuring conditions. Depending on the instrument, the obtained spectra exhibited differences in absorbance, but not in wavelengths of bands position and maxima. As a result, the mutual prediction of original data (without mathematical correction) from different instruments using a partial least squares discriminant analysis model built and optimized with spectral data from only one instrument provided a sensitivity of 0% for the two-class model of rapeseed in pumpkin seed oil, indicating no discrimination at all. In order to minimize the spectral differences and thus to enhance the performance parameters of the prediction models, different mathematical correction approaches were investigated: (i) instrument-specific correction factors, (ii) combinations of different pre-processing steps and (iii) piecewise direct standardization (partial least squares-based regression). All investigated approaches achieved classification results with 100% sensitivity for the mathematically corrected data set of the respective instrument. The outcome of this study indicates that the correction approaches can be used to optimize the comparability of spectral data from different instruments, which is a first step towards harmonization in non-targeted analysis.

TI DGFaceNet: Lightweight and efficient face recognition
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

AB Face recognition has achieved great success due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). However, complex DCNNs bring a large number of parameters as well as computational effort, which poses a significant challenge to resource-constrained embedded devices. Meanwhile, the commonly popular loss functions and lightweight networks are not so effective for face recognition. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of the number of similar features generated by inexpensive operations on model performance. It is shown that DCNNs can tolerate more similar features generated by cheap operations in the early stage of the network. We construct Dynamic Ghost Bottleneck based on this idea, and DGFaceNet is composed of stacking Dynamic Ghost Bottleneck. In addition, we propose a new class-margin-linear softmax loss function (CML-softmax) for lightweight networks. CML-softmax designs a quadratic function to replace the cosine function as the target logit, which allows better performance and convergence in low-dimensional output for face recognition. Meanwhile, CML-softmax introduces two margin functions to alleviate class imbalance and softmax early saturation problems, respectively. Our method demonstrates competitive results in many validation datasets and large-scale popular benchmark tests. Speed tests on embedded devices show that the actual inference time of DGFaceNet is 11.08 times, 8.57 times, 2.75 times, and 2.82 times faster than ResNet-50, EfficientNet, MobileNetV2, and MobileFaceNet, respectively. DGFaceNet can significantly improve the running efficiency of the model in resource-constrained embedded devices while ensuring the model's performance.

DE Multimodal machine learning; Graph neural networks; Emotion recognition
   in conversation; Multimodal fusion
AB Multimodal machine learning is an emerging area of research, which has received a great deal of scholarly attention in recent years. Up to now, there are few studies on multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC). Since Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) possess the powerful capacity of relational modeling, they have an inherent advantage in the field of multimodal learning. GNNs leverage the graph constructed from multimodal data to perform intra- and inter-modal information interaction, which effectively facilitates the integration and complementation of multimodal data. In this work, we propose a novel Graph network based Multimodal Fusion Technique (GraphMFT) for emotion recognition in conversation. Multimodal data can be modeled as a graph, where each data object is regarded as a node, and both intra- and inter-modal dependencies existing between data objects can be regarded as edges. GraphMFT utilizes multiple improved graph attention networks to capture intra-modal contextual information and inter-modal complementary information. In addition, the proposed GraphMFT attempts to address the challenges of existing graph-based multimodal conversational emotion recognition models such as MMGCN. Empirical results on two public multimodal datasets reveal that our model outperforms the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches with the accuracy of 67.90% and 61.30%. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reliability-redundancy allocation problem (RRAP) plays a vital role in reliability improvement and designing of systems which depend on the arrangement of components, reliability of the components, and redundancy allocation for the components. Higher reliability is the primary requisite for essential systems such as fire extinguisher drones (FEDs) which are very valuable for firefighters in tackling emergencies in non-reachable areas. In this work, a FED is considered with the aim of system designing for maximum reliability while considering the limited availability of resources such as volume, cost, and weight of the system. A total of five possible arrangements of the redundant components are investigated, and a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is solved for system reliability optimization. For optimization purposes, a recently developed metaheuristic hybrid particle swarm grey wolf optimizer (HPSGWO) is implemented. The HPSGWO is a powerful fusion of PSO's exploitation property and GWO's exploration property. Solving RRAP by using HPSGWO provides 99% reliability of the proposed FED under the limited availability of resources. To validate the superiority of the HPSGWO, a comparative study is explained.

AB Path planning is an NP-hard problem in road network environments. Considering that the existing path planning algorithms mainly have the problems of low smoothness and low search efficiency in generating paths in large-scale complex environments, an improved rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, the grid method is applied to model the road network environment, and the RRT algorithm based on adjacency expansion is proposed to search the initial path. Then, the strategies of identifying paths and eliminating redundant paths are adopted, respectively, to further optimize the selected paths. Experimental results show that, compared with other path planning algorithms, our algorithm can achieve faster convergence speed, shorter search path, and better smoothness in a complex map of the environment.

AB The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of three different filling techniques, namely the iRoot SP single-point method, the iRoot SP filling method, and the iRoot SP hot gutta-percha filling method, in sealing single-canal premolars using micro-CT scanning reconstruction measurement method. All root canals were prepared with ProTaper Universal system up to F3. The samples were randomly divided into three groups (n = 20). After 1 week, micro-CT scanning was used to measure the proportion of air volume in the root canal to the total root canal volume, air bubble cross-section ratio, and overall filling volume in each group. Results showed that group A (iRoot SP single-point method) had the least cross-sectional proportion of voids, with the smallest porosity in the overall and tip 1/3. Group B (iRoot SP filling method) had the largest porosity in the middle 1/3, with no significant difference among other groups. Overall, the three filling methods of iRoot SP could not entirely prevent the occurrence of pores, and the iRoot SP single-point method presented the highest filling quality.

AB Low-light image enhancement is a low-level vision task. Most of the existing methods are based on convolutional neural network(CNN). Transformer is a predominant deep learning model that has been widely adopted in various fields, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Compared with CNN, transformer has the ability to capture long-range dependencies to make full use of global contextual information. For low-light enhancement tasks, this capability can promote the model to learn the correct luminance, color and texture. We try to introduce transformer into the low-light image enhancement field. In this paper, we design a pyramid transformer with cross-shaped windows (CSwin-P). CSwin-P contains an encoder and decoder. Both the encoder and decoder contain several stages. Each stage contains several enhanced CSwin transformer blocks (ECTB). ECTB uses cross-shaped window self-attention and a feed-forward layer with spatial interaction unit. Spatial interaction unit can further capture local contextual information through gating mechanism. CSwin-P uses implicit positional encoding, and the model is unrestricted by the image size in the inference phase. Numerous experiments prove that our method is superior to the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB The process of capturing and searching the posture and motion information of the target human body in three-dimensional space is to capture human motion. However, in the actual use process, the motion capture system based on machine vision will often be blocked in the application background, resulting in image errors. Therefore, capturing human motion is still a challenging topic. In the actual physical education teaching process, the combination of motion capture technology can create a virtual reality learning environment for students, so as to effectively strengthen teaching interaction, stimulate learning enthusiasm and make the teaching process more subjective and three-dimensional. Based on the human skeleton and joint model, this paper constructs the model required for human motion capture and studies the process of capturing motion data under the principle of machine vision: first, preprocess the image, enhance and binarize the current image after image filtering, so as to obtain relatively clear motion capture results. Then, it systematically analyzes the real physical education teaching needs of colleges and universities, establishes the design framework of physical education action capture system, develops the algorithm that corresponds the action capture results to the machine vision of manikin and establishes the related system to evaluate the accuracy of the system. By studying machine vision technology, this paper applies it to the field of sports teaching action capture system design, thus promoting the development of college sports teaching.

AB Based on the research and investigation of the psycho-educational development and assessment of college students, this paper designs an interactive system for automatic evaluation of the psychoeducation of college students, which is based on the KNN data classification model and the current technical and environmental conditions. Based on the data from the psychological survey of college students and personal information, this article screens the psychological evaluation data of students, analyzes the key information in the data, obtains the correlation rules of various factors, and analyzes the experimental results. Aiming at the problem that KNN algorithm has low classification accuracy on unbalanced data, we proposes a weighted KNN hybrid algorithm. The harmonic weighted KNN classifier is added to the SVM-KNN classifier for fitting, and the SVM-KNN hybrid algorithm is jointly established. Combined with the principle of SVM-KNN hybrid data classifier, the improved algorithm is applied to a wider range of data value areas, and the appropriate algorithm is selected for data classification and prediction by judging the threshold size. For the data classification calculation method, the Euclidean distance calculation method is generally used to calculate the point-to-point distance in the plane coordinate system, as for hyper plane high-dimensional data, the improved algorithm uses a more suitable kernel function calculation method. According to the designed experimental step program, a series of basic performance such as the calculation rate of the algorithm and the system are tested, and the results show that it can be satisfied, which proves that the interactive automatic evaluation system of College Students' psychological education designed in this paper can effectively understand the psychological status of college students at this stage, find the students who need to focus on psychological counseling, and carry out psychological health education, so as to provide reference for the actual college students' psychological health education.

AB The technology in the field of garden landscape is constantly developing with the progress of today's society, industry has also been promoted, and various styles of landscapes have appeared one by one according to the needs of the times. However, the research of landscape design still seems to remain on the basis of more formal, patterned, and visual design, thus ignoring the interaction between design works and objects of use. This paper aims to integrate mathematical terrain into the field of landscape design and uses realistic digital terrain to enhance the realism of virtual landscapes and enhance the user's immersion. To date, researchers have proposed many terrain editing techniques, but no more comprehensive examination of terrain features and editing requirements has been carried out to meet more general terrain modeling needs. Based on deep learning technology, this paper constructs the design of interactive scene mathematical terrain editing system. The system consists of two subsystems: scene management system and user interface system. Each subsystem has its own function module, which is convenient for users to use. Each functional module can be called according to user preferences to create the desired landscape terrain. In the final evaluation of the customer, the hills and plains created based on the sketch are better than the original work. It can be concluded that the system not only has excellent effects in practical applications but also has a wide range of cross-domain applications and has a broad development prospect. This paper designs a class of interactive editable systems combined with mathematical terrain by introducing deep learning technology into the field of landscape design.

AB In today's society, the incidence rate of cerebrovascular diseases is increasing year by year, which has become one of the main reasons for the increasing death probability of human diseases, so it has also become a major health problem. To further analyze whether the method of labeling with ultra small Fe3O4 nanoparticles and then using MR high-resolution vascular wall imaging technology are effective in the treatment of vertebrobasilar artery ectasia. 120 confirmed patients were selected as the experimental subjects for this study, and comparisons were made in terms of gender, age, and other factors. There was no significant difference between the two groups of patients, and relevant examinations were performed using MRI scanners. In the plaque load index, the BA in the VBD group was 71.24 & PLUSMN; 13.30, while the BA in the non VBD group was 79.37 & PLUSMN; 11.69, P = 0.039; The VA of the VBD group was 81.91 & PLUSMN; 10.20, while the VA of the non VBD group was 72.11 & PLUSMN; 11.30, P = 0.007. The results showed that the plaque load of the non VBD group was higher than that of the VBD group. The method of labeling with ultra small Fe3O4 nanoparticles and using MR high resolution vascular wall imaging technology has played a very good role in the treatment of vertebrobasilar artery ectasia.

AB This paper proposes an artificial KNN dynamic expansion query strategy. Because the query strategy can well subdivide the location in the cell and expand its query range, it can enable KNN to dynamically expand the query to return as soon as possible, and minimize repeated calculations and comparisons. On this basis, reduce the execution time, if there is a given k value, analyze its most meshing scale. At the same time, the specified k value and the grid scale of the number of objects are analyzed, and the dynamic execution strategy based on relative distance pruning is applicable to KNN queries at other distances, which has non-equivalent characteristics except triangles. The experimental results show that other traditional query strategies of K value and grid scale have considerable performance benefits. Based on this article, we will discuss the specific design principles and curriculum optimization methods of the popular music teaching system based on the Moodle platform. Through the second development of the Moodle platform and combined with new research, the system is deeply analyzed. Gonsorge's teaching strategies such as scaffolding education, anchoring education, random education, and construction guidance methods are integrated into the development of the curriculum. Make students' learning on the online education platform more handier. On the basis of the network platform, students are guided to study independently on the platform, and actively complete the self-construction of knowledge through their own exploration and cognition of the environment. Doing so can improve the students' practical ability in learning, and the teaching activities of popular music courses can also be carried out efficiently.

AB With the continuous progress of medical technology, intelligent medical diagnosis systems have become an important direction for the development of medical technology. In terms of cerebral vascular examination, magnetic resonance cerebrovascular imaging has become one of the conventional examination methods. It can be used to evaluate cerebrovascular diseases, such as aneurysms, cerebral vascular stenosis, cerebral vascular malformations, etc. The purpose of this article is to study the application value of intelligent medical systems combined with magnetic resonance cerebrovascular imaging technology in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms. The researchers selected 50 patients for the experiment. Among them, the experimental group patients used intelligent medical systems for auxiliary diagnosis, while the control group patients used conventional diagnostic methods. By using magnetic resonance cerebrovascular imaging to diagnose patients, researchers compared the diagnostic results of two groups of patients to evaluate the application effect of intelligent medical systems in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms. After the experiment, the vascular visualization score of the experimental group was 3.645 & PLUSMN; 0.489, while the score of the control group was 3.598 & PLUSMN; 0.558 (P < 0.05). After the experiment, the saturation artifact score of the experimental group was 3.933 & PLUSMN; 0.249, while the score of the control group was 2.805 & PLUSMN; 0.539 (P < 0.05), indicating that the scanning sequence score of the experimental group was better than that of the control group. The intelligent medical system has optimized the magnetic resonance imaging module to better extract user symptoms and apply it to medical diagnosis.

AB Root cause analysis (RCA) is a powerful tool utilized to identify the underlying causes of an event or problem. However, due to the specificity of production requirements in the process industry, existing methods still face challenges such as insufficient or unreliable data, and intrinsic complexities. Therefore, RCA relies on decision making in the process industry which is actually a typical knowledge-intensive work. To address these challenges, we propose a new causal knowledge maps-based RCA method that combines a newly developed grey reasoning dynamic uncertain causality graph (GRDUCG) with an improved grey relation analysis (IGRA) technique. The proposed method utilizes GRDUCG to construct a causal knowledge map to represent the complex knowledge. Under the large group environment, the IGRA method is employed to integrate causal knowledge provided by domain experts, thus determining the parameters' values which take the form of interval grey numbers. Due to the importance of distinguishing coefficient in IGRA, a new decision method is proposed to improve GRA instead of subjective decision based on the maximum information entropy. Root causes are identified using the maximum posterior probability on the causal knowledge map. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approach by utilizing GRDUCG-IGRA to analyze abnormal conditions in a real-world aluminum electrolysis plant.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT; NETWORK
AB Multi-exposure image fusion (MEF) is an affordable and convenient option for high-dynamic-range imaging. Current MEF methods are prone to visually unrealistic results since they take no account of perceptual factors. To address this problem, a multi-exposure image fusion method is proposed based on perception enhanced structural patch decomposition, namely PESPD-MEF. An image patch is first decomposed into four components: perceptual gain, signal strength, signal structure, and mean intensity. Then, the enhancement rule is designed for perceptual gain, and the latter three elements are fused independently in different ways. Finally, the fused components are aggregated to generate informative and perception-realistic results. Moreover, the multi-scale framework is adopted to boost the fused performance. The proposed method is also extended to address single low-light image enhancement issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of perceptual realism.

ID DISTANCE; PLATFORM
AB Applications with mobile and sensing devices have already become ubiquitous. In most of these applications, trajectory data is continuously growing to huge volumes. Existing systems for big trajectory data organize trajectories at distributed block storage systems. Systems like DITA that use block storage (e.g., 128 MB each) are more efficient for analytical queries, but they cannot incrementally maintain the partitioned data and do not support delete operations, resulting in difficulties in trajectory analytics. In this paper, we propose an incremental trajectory partitioning framework Tinba that enables distributed block storage systems to efficiently maintain optimized partitions under incremental updates of trajectories. We employ a data flushing technique to bulk ingest trajectory data for random writing in distributed file system (DFS). We recast the incremental partitioning problem as an optimal partitioning problem and prove its NP-hardness. A cost- benefit model is proposed to address the optimal partitioning problem. Moreover, Tinba supports most of the existing similarity measures to quantify the similarity between trajectories. A heuristic is developed to instantiate the Tinba framework. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the advancements in ingestion performance and partition quality, as opposed to other trajectory partition methods.

AB In fields such as pattern recognition and computational intelligence, attribute subset selection has gradually attracted the attention of researchers as a challenging issue, particularly in big data. In rough sets community, many of the selection methods until now have been proposed based on one-directional and non-adaptive rough approximation sets, which increase the uncertainty of granular computing. Based on a series of bi-directional adaptive neighborhood rough sets models, a novel attribute subset selection method is proposed in this paper. In contrast to classical one-directional k-nearest neighborhood relations, the proposed model not only allocates different numbers of neighbors to each sample, but also takes the support information of the neighbors into account in the construction of information granularity. On the basis of set operators, two specific bidirectional neighborhood relations as well as optimistic and pessimistic rough set models are discussed in detail. Several propositions and uncertainty measures not only show the relationship between the traditional and the proposed models, but also present the intrinsic connection of three discussed models. In addition, we propose an optimal neighbor selection scheme, in which justifiable granularity is fused with evidence theory to obtain an optimal k value for each sample. Finally, in the attribute selection process, we prove non-monotonic property of the neighborhood entropy and describe an upgraded forward greedy algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing algorithms using a ten-fold cross-validation method on several UCI datasets. The experimental results show the advantages of our models in terms of computational performance and classification accuracy, respectively.

AB Due to often working in the environment of variable speeds and loads, it is an enormous challenge to achieve high-accuracy fault diagnosis (FD) of rolling bearings (RB) via existing approaches. In the article, a novel FD approach of RB, named IVTN-SA, is proposed by integrating subdomain adaptation (SA) and an improved vision transformer network (IVTN). To begin with, a local maximum mean discrepancy is introduced to replace the popular distribution alignment strategy of the same fault type in different domains based on adversarial learning mechanism and global maximum mean discrepancy. Then, the traditional vision transformer net is improved by employing a deformable convolution (DC) module to replace plain counterparts in existing CNN architectures and using a recurrent neural network to obtain the position encoding adaptively. The proposed method makes full use of the strong ability of SA in domain adaptation, the distinctive advantage of DC on feature extraction based on local information and the excellent performance of vision transformer in representing complicated relationships based on global information, thus realizing the fusion of local and global information and over-coming the distribution difference caused by working condition fluctuation. Two experimental cases have been conducted to verify its effectiveness in various working conditions, and the results demonstrate our proposed approach can achieve more excellent performance on diagnosis accuracy and model complexity compared with existing methods.

AB Great efforts have been devoted to causal discovery from observational data, and it is well known that introducing some background knowledge attained from experiments or human expertise can be very helpful. However, it remains unknown that what causal relations are identifiable given background knowledge in the presence of latent confounders. In this paper, we solve the problem with sound and complete orientation rules when the background knowledge is given in a local form. Furthermore, based on the solution to the problem, this paper proposes two applications that are of independent interests. One is that we give a maximal ancestral graph (MAG) listing algorithm, to output all the MAGs consistent to the observational data in the presence of latent variables. The other application is that we present a general active learning framework for causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders, where we propose a baseline criterion to select the intervention variable with a Metropolis-Hastings MAG-sampling method. Experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed MAG listing method and the effectiveness of the active learning framework.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DATA ANALYTICS
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) tend to suffer from high computation costs due to the exponentially increasing scale of graph data and a large number of model parameters, which restricts their utility in practical applications. To this end, some recent works focus on sparsifying GNNs (including graph structures and model parameters) with the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance levels. However, the LTH-based methods suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) they require exhaustive and iterative training of dense models, resulting in an extremely large training computation cost, and 2) they only trim graph structures and model parameters but ignore the node feature dimension, where vast redundancy exists. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a comprehensive graph gradual pruning framework termed CGP. This is achieved by designing a during-training graph pruning paradigm to dynamically prune GNNs within one training process. Unlike LTH-based methods, the proposed CGP approach requires no retraining, which significantly reduces the computation costs. Furthermore, we design a cosparsifying strategy to comprehensively trim all the three core elements of GNNs: graph structures, node features, and model parameters. Next, to refine the pruning operation, we introduce a regrowth process into our CGP framework, to reestablish the pruned but important connections. The proposed CGP is evaluated over a node classification task across six GNN architectures, including shallow models graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT), shallow-but-deep-propagation models simple graph convolution (SGC) and approximate personalized propagation of neural predictions (APPNP), and deep models GCN via initial residual and identity mapping (GCNII) and residual GCN (ResGCN), on a total of 14 real-world graph datasets, including large-scale graph datasets from the challenging Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Experiments reveal that the proposed strategy greatly improves both training and inference efficiency while matching or even exceeding the accuracy of the existing methods.

AB Dependency trees parsed from natural language sentences have been proven to be beneficial for the relation extraction task by deep neural networks. However, effectively and efficiently utilizing the structural information of dependency trees remains a challenging research problem for neural networks. Existing methods either struggle to facilitate interaction between nodes at different levels that are distant in the dependency tree or face limitations due to computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a novel model, named Self-Attention over Tree for Relation Extraction (SATRE), designed for tree-structured data and adept at fully utilizing the structural information implied in the subtrees of dependency trees. SATRE enables interactions among nodes in each subtree, even when they are on widely separated layers. As a result, nodes are learned across multiple subtrees, making SATRE data-efficient; that is, SATRE remains efficient even when data is scarce. Furthermore, SATRE is implemented using a parallel mechanism. Specifically, SATRE parallelly computes node representations of a tree in two levels: across all subtrees of the tree and across all nodes within a subtree. Empirically, SATRE consistently outperforms the compared methods on two real-world benchmarks: the TACRED and SemEval-2010 Task 8 datasets, which shows the effectiveness of SATRE. Meanwhile, extensive experiments indicate SATRE's data-efficiency in utilizing the training data and its computational efficiency in running time.

AB In this article, we determine analytical upper bounds on the local Lipschitz constants of feedforward neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions. We do so by deriving Lipschitz constants and bounds for ReLU, affine-ReLU, and max-pooling functions and combining the results to determine a network-wide bound. Our method uses several insights to obtain tight bounds, such as keeping track of the zero elements of each layer and analyzing the composition of affine and ReLU functions. Furthermore, we employ a careful computational approach, which allows us to apply our method to large networks, such as AlexNet and VGG-16. We present several examples using different networks, which show how our local Lipschitz bounds are tighter than the global Lipschitz bounds. We also show how our method can be applied to provide adversarial bounds for classification networks. These results show that our method produces the largest known bounds on minimum adversarial perturbations for large networks, such as AlexNet and VGG-16.

ID IMAGE QUALITY ASSESSMENT; INFORMATION; SIMILARITY
AB Although the research of arbitrary style transfer (AST) has achieved great progress in recent years, few studies pay special attention to the perceptual evaluation of AST images that are usually influenced by complicated factors, such as structure-preserving, style similarity, and overall vision (OV). Existing methods rely on elaborately designed hand-crafted features to obtain quality factors and apply a rough pooling strategy to evaluate the final quality. However, the importance weights between the factors and the final quality will lead to unsatisfactory performances by simple quality pooling. In this article, we propose a learnable network, named collaborative learning and style-adaptive pooling network (CLSAP-Net) to better address this issue. The CLSAP-Net contains three parts, i.e., content preservation estimation network (CPE-Net), style resemblance estimation network (SRE-Net), and OV target network (OVT-Net). Specifically, CPE-Net and SRE-Net use the self-attention mechanism and a joint regression strategy to generate reliable quality factors for fusion and weighting vectors for manipulating the importance weights. Then, grounded on the observation that style type can influence human judgment of the importance of different factors, our OVT-Net utilizes a novel style-adaptive pooling strategy guiding the importance weights of factors to collaboratively learn the final quality based on the trained CPE-Net and SRE-Net parameters. In our model, the quality pooling process can be conducted in a self-adaptive manner because the weights are generated after understanding the style type. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed CLSAP-Net are well validated by extensive experiments on the existing AST image quality assessment (IQA) databases. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Hangwei-Chen/CLSAP-Net

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Unsupervised video prediction aims to predict future outcomes based on the observed video frames, thus removing the need for supervisory annotations. This research task has been argued as a key component of intelligent decision-making systems, as it presents the potential capacities of modeling the underlying patterns of videos. Essentially, the challenge of video prediction is to effectively model the complex spatiotemporal and often uncertain dynamics of high-dimensional video data. In this context, an appealing way of modeling spatiotemporal dynamics is to explore prior physical knowledge, such as partial differential equations (PDEs). In this article, considering real-world video data as a partly observed stochastic environment, we introduce a new stochastic PDE predictor (SPDE-predictor), which models the spatiotemporal dynamics by approximating a generalized form of PDEs while dealing with the stochasticity. A second contribution is that we disentangle the high-dimensional video prediction into low-level dimensional factors of variations: time-varying stochastic PDE dynamics and time-invariant content factors. Extensive experiments on four various video datasets show that SPDE video prediction model (SPDE-VP) outperforms both deterministic and stochastic state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight our superiority driven by both PDE dynamics modeling and disentangled representation learning and their relevance in long-term video prediction.

AB There is a phenomenon of attaching importance to technique and neglecting emotion in the training of sports dance (SP), which leads to the lack of integration between movement and emotion and seriously affects the training effect. Therefore, this article uses the Kinect 3D sensor to collect the video information of SP performers and obtains the pose estimation of SP performers by extracting the key feature points. The ArousalValence (AV) emotion model, based on the Fusion Neural Network model (FUSNN), is also combined with theoretical knowledge. It replaces long short term memory (LSTM) with gate recurrent unit (GRU), adds layer-normalization and layer-dropout, and reduces stack levels, and it is used to categorize SP performers' emotions. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this article can accurately detect the key points in the performance of SP performers' technical movements and has a high emotional recognition accuracy in the tasks of 4 categories and eight categories, reaching 72.3% and 47.8%, respectively. This study accurately detected the key points of SP performers in the presentation of technical movements and made a major contribution to the emotional recognition and relief of this group in the training process.

AB With the desired outcome of social good within the wider robotics ecosystem, trust is identified as the central adhesive of the human-robot interaction (HRI) interface. However, building trust between humans and robots involves more than improving the machine's technical reliability or trustworthiness in function. This paper presents a holistic, community-based approach to trust-building, where trust is understood as a multifaceted and multi-staged looped relation that depends heavily on context and human perceptions. Building on past literature that identifies dispositional and learned stages of trust, our proposed decision to trust model considers more extensively the human and situational factors influencing how trust manifests within social relations. Priority is given to the human user of technology-the initiator of human-robot trust relations-at all stages of decision-making. The envisioned formation of optimal conditions in which trust emerges requires the collective participation of practitioners, policymakers, and members of the community. With trust facilitating the smooth transition of robots into more socially embedded roles, positive receptivity of the best engineering project arises from the presence of harmonious robot-human trust relations in community spaces.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents often suffer from catastrophic forgetting, forgetting previously found solutions in parts of the input space when training new data. Replay memories are a common solution to the problem by decorrelating and shuffling old and new training samples. They naively store state transitions as they arrive, without regard for redundancy. We introduce a novel cognitive-inspired replay memory approach based on the Grow-When-Required (GWR) self-organizing network, which resembles a map-based mental model of the world. Our approach organizes stored transitions into a concise environment-model-like network of state nodes and transition edges, merging similar samples to reduce the memory size and increase pair-wise distance among samples, which increases the relevancy of each sample. Overall, our study shows that map-based experience replay allows for significant memory reduction with only small decreases in performance.

AB This article proposes an optimal controller for a team of underactuated quadrotors with multiple active leaders in containment control tasks. The quadrotor dynamics are underactuated, nonlinear, uncertain, and subject to external disturbances. The active team leaders have control inputs to enhance the maneuverability of the containment system. The proposed controller consists of a position control law to guarantee the achievement of position containment and an attitude control law to regulate the rotational motion, which are learned via off-policy reinforcement learning using historical data from quadrotor trajectories. The closed-loop system stability can be guaranteed by theoretical analysis. Simulation results of cooperative transportation missions with multiple active leaders demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Contrastive learning has recently attracted plenty of attention in deep graph clustering for its promising performance. However, complicated data augmentations and time-consuming graph convolutional operation undermine the efficiency of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Simple Contrastive Graph Clustering (SCGC) algorithm to improve the existing methods from the perspectives of network architecture, data augmentation, and objective function. As to the architecture, our network includes two main parts, i.e., pre-processing and network backbone. A simple low-pass denoising operation conducts neighbor information aggregation as an independent pre-processing, and only two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) are included as the backbone. For data augmentation, instead of introducing complex operations over graphs, we construct two augmented views of the same vertex by designing parameter un-shared siamese encoders and corrupting the node embeddings directly. Finally, as to the objective function, to further improve the clustering performance, a novel cross-view structural consistency objective function is designed to enhance the discriminative capability of the learned network. Extensive experimental results on seven benchmark datasets validate our proposed algorithm's effectiveness and superiority. Significantly, our algorithm outperforms the recent contrastive deep clustering competitors with at least seven times speedup on average.

AB In-memory deep learning executes neural network models where they are stored, thus avoiding long-distance communication between memory and computation units, resulting in considerable savings in energy and time. In-memory deep learning has already demonstrated orders of magnitude higher performance density and energy efficiency. The use of emerging memory technology (EMT) promises to increase density, energy, and performance even further. However, EMT is intrinsically unstable, resulting in random data read fluctuations. This can translate to nonnegligible accuracy loss, potentially nullifying the gains. In this article, we propose three optimization techniques that can mathematically overcome the instability problem of EMT. They can improve the accuracy of the in-memory deep learning model while maximizing its energy efficiency. Experiments show that our solution can fully recover most models' state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and achieves at least an order of magnitude higher energy efficiency than the SOTA.

AB In the real world, networks with many types of nodes and edges are complex, forming a heterogeneous network. For instance, film networks contain different node types, such as directors, films and actors, as well as different types of edge and multimodal attributes. Most existing attribution network embedding algorithms cannot flexibly capture the impact of multimodal attributes on the topology. Premature fusion of multimodal features encodes different attribute information into the representation embedding, while the later fusion strategy ignores the interaction between different modes, both of which affect the modeling of graph embedding.To solve this problem, we propose a multimodal attribute network representation learning algorithm based on heterogeneity information fusion, named FHIANE. It extracts features from multimodal information sources through deep heterogeneous convolutional networks and projects them into a consistent semantic space while maintaining structural information. In addition, we design a modality fusion network based on an extended attention mechanism that takes full advantage of the consistency and complementarity of multimodal information. We evaluate the performance of the FHIANE algorithm on several real datasets through challenging tasks such as link prediction and node classification. The experimental results show that FHIANE outperforms other baselines.

AB Robust model estimation aims to estimate the parameters of a given geometric model, and then separate the outliers and inliers belonging to different model instances into different groups based on the estimated parameters. Robust model estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision and artificial intelligence, and mainly contains two components: data sampling for generating hypotheses and model selection for segmenting data. Over the past decade, a number of guided data sampling algorithms and model selection algorithms have been proposed separately. This results in that the performance of the robust model estimation method is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive study of the above algorithms, by analyzing and comparing them. Then, we propose an efficient and effective robust model estimation method by using preference analysis and information theory principles. Specifically, we first employ our previously proposed data sampling algorithm based on preference analysis to sample data subsets for generating promising hypotheses. Then, we build a discriminative sparse affinity matrix based on the generated hypotheses by using information theory principles. Finally, we segment data by conducting a spectral clustering on the discriminative affinity matrix. Experimental results on the AdelaideRMF and the Hopkins 155 datasets show that the proposed method achieves higher segmentation accuracies than several state-of-the-art model estimation methods.

TI Rethinking cross-domain semantic relation for few-shot image generation

DE Generative adversarial networks; Cross-domain semantic relation;
   Perceptual similarity; Contrastive learning; Few-shot image generation
AB Training well-performing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with limited data has always been challenging. Existing methods either require sufficient data (over 100 training images) for training or generate images of low quality and low diversity. To solve this problem, we propose a new Cross-domain Semantic Relation (CSR) loss. The CSR loss improves the performance of the generative model by maintaining the relationship between instances in the source domain and generated images. At the same time, a perceptual similarity loss and a discriminative contrastive loss are designed to further enrich the diversity of generated images and stabilize the training process of models. Experiments on nine publicly available few-shot datasets and comparisons with the current nine methods show that our approach is superior to all baseline methods. Finally, we perform ablation studies on the proposed three loss functions and prove that these three loss functions are essential for few-shot image generation tasks. Code is available at .

TI Mirror variational transport: a particle-based algorithm for
   distributional optimization on constrained domains
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE Distributional optimization; Functional gradient descent; Mirror descent
AB We consider the optimization problem of minimizing an objective functional, which admits a variational form and is defined over probability distributions on a constrained domain, which poses challenges to both theoretical analysis and algorithmic design. We propose Mirror Variational Transport (mirrorVT), which uses a set of samples, or particles, to represent the approximating distribution and deterministically updates the particles to optimize the functional. To deal with the constrained domain, in each iteration, mirrorVT maps the particles to an unconstrained dual domain, induced by a mirror map, and then approximately performs Wasserstein Gradient Descent on the manifold of distributions defined over the dual space to update each particle by a specified direction. At the end of each iteration, particles are mapped back to the original constrained domain. Through experiments on synthetic and real world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of mirrorVT for the distributional optimization on the constrained domain. We also analyze its theoretical properties and characterize its convergence to the global minimum of the objective functional.

DE Semi-supervised autoencoder; Fairness; Deep neural networks
AB Semi-supervised learning has shown its potential in many real-world applications where only few labeled examples are available. However, when some fairness constraints need to be satisfied, semi-supervised classification models often struggle as they are required to cope with the lack of sufficient information for predicting the target variable while forgetting its relationships with any sensitive and potentially discriminatory attribute. To address this issue, we propose a fair semi-supervised representation learning architecture that leads to fair and accurate classification results even in very challenging scenarios with few labeled (but biased) instances. We show experimentally that our model can be easily adopted in very general settings, as the learned representations may be employed to train any supervised classifier. Moreover, when applied to several synthetic and real-world datasets, our method is competitive with state-of-the-art fair semi-supervised approaches.

TI NaCL: noise-robust cross-domain contrastive learning for unsupervised
   domain adaptation
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; Contrastive learning; Clustering
AB The Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods aim to enhance feature transferability possibly at the expense of feature discriminability. Recently, contrastive representation learning has been applied to UDA as a promising approach. One way is to combine the mainstream domain adaptation method with contrastive self-supervised tasks. The other way uses contrastive learning to align class-conditional distributions according to the semantic structure information of source and target domains. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in two aspects. One is that optimal solutions for the contrastive self-supervised learning and the domain discrepancy minimization may not be consistent. The other is that contrastive learning uses pseudo label information of target domain to align class-conditional distributions, where the pseudo label information contains noise such that false positive and negative pairs would deteriorate the performance of contrastive learning. To address these issues, we propose Noise-robust cross-domain Contrastive Learning (NaCL) to directly realize the domain adaptation task via simultaneously learning the instance-wise discrimination and encoding semantic structures in intra- and inter-domain to the learned representation space. More specifically, we adopt topology-based selection on the target domain to detect and remove false positive and negative pairs in contrastive loss. Theoretically, we demonstrate that not only NaCL can be considered an example of Expectation Maximization (EM), but also accurate pseudo label information is beneficial for reducing the expected error on target domain. NaCL obtains superior results on three public benchmarks. Further, NaCL can also be applied to semi-supervised domain adaptation with only minor modifications, achieving advanced diagnostic performance on COVID-19 dataset. Code is available at

DE Long text matching; Noise filtering; Transformer; PageRank
AB In the field of deep matching, a large amount of noisy data in Chinese long texts affects the matching effect. Most long-form text matching models use all text data indiscriminately, which results in a large amount of noisy data, and thus the PageRank algorithm is combined with Transformer to filter noise. For sentence-level noise detection, after calculating the overlap rate of words to evaluate the similarity, a sentence-level relationship graph is constructed and filtered by using the PageRank algorithm; for word-level noise detection, based on the attention score in Transformer, a word graph is established, then the PageRank algorithm is executed on graph, combined with self-attention weights, to select keywords to highlight topic relevance, the noisy words are filtered sequentially at different layers in the module, layer by layer. In addition, during the model training, PolyLoss is applied to replace the traditional binary Cross-Entropy loss function, thus reducing the difficulty of hyperparameter tuning. Finally, a better filtering strategy is proposed and experiments are conducted to verify it on two Chinese long-form text matching datasets. The result shows that the matching model based on the noise filtering strategy of this paper can better filter the noise and capture the matching signal more accurately.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Label relaxation; Stacked autoencoder; Zero-shot learning
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Recently, Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) has gained great attention due to its significant classification performance for novel unobserved classes. As seen and unseen classes are completely disjoint, the current ZSL methods inevitably suffer from the domain shift problem when transferring the knowledge between the observed and unseen classes. Additionally, most ZSL methods especially those targeting the semantic space may cause the hubness problem due to their use of nearest-neighbor classifiers in high-dimensional space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel pathway termed Regularized Label Relaxation-based Stacked Autoencoder (RLRSA) to diminish the domain difference between seen and unseen classes by exploiting an effective label space, which has some notable advantages. First, the proposed method establishes the tight relations among the visual representation, semantic information and label space using via the stacked autoencoder, which is beneficial for avoiding the projection domain shift. Second, by incorporating a slack variable matrix into the label space, our RLRSA method has more freedom to fit the test samples whether they come from the observed or unseen classes, resulting in a very robust and discriminative projection. Third, we construct a manifold regularization based on a class compactness graph to further reduce the domain gap between the seen and unseen classes. Finally, the learned projection is utilized to predict the class label of the target sample, thus the hubness issue can be prevented. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets clearly show that our RLRSA method produces new state-of-the-art results under two standard ZSL settings. For example, the RLRSA obtains the highest average accuracy of 67.82% on five benchmark datasets under the pure ZSL setting. For the generalized ZSL task, the proposed RLRSA is still highly effective, e.g., it achieves the best H result of 58.9% on the AwA2 dataset.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Object classification based on tactile perception plays an essential role in robot manipulation process, as it serves for decision-making for the the downstream manipulation tasks. The demand for precise execution by industrial robots in smart factories has increased, and like humans, robots can infer tactile properties and identify object categories through brief motions. However, traditional practices only consider grasping as an instant state, resulting in the absence of time-series information. To address this issue, we propose a spatio-temporal attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to solve the time-series problem for object classification. The proposed model utilizes a temporal attention mechanism that can dynamically trace the time-related features of the tactile data. Moreover, a spatial attention mechanism coordinates the integration of tactile information from various input features. The model classifies objects based on the entire temporal process of robot-object contact rather than data from a particular moment. To further enhance the model's performance, we also incorporate PCA and Kalman filter. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed model's accuracy and efficiency, validating its ability to perform object classification based on tactile perception.

AB The modeling of channel and temporal information is of crucial importance for action recognition tasks. To build a high-performance action recognition network by effectively capturing channel and temporal information, we propose CLS-Net: an action recognition algorithm based on channel-temporal information modeling. The proposed CLS-Net characterizes channel and temporal information by inserting multiple modules to an end-to-end backbone network, including a channel attention module (CA module) for modeling channel information, a long-term temporal module (LT module) and a short-term temporal module (ST module) for modeling temporal information. Specifically, the CA module extracts the correlation between feature channels so the network can learn to selectively strengthen the features containing useful information and suppress the useless features through global information. The LT module moves some channels in the temporal dimension to realize information interaction across time domains and model global temporal information. The ST module enhances the motion-sensitive features by calculating the feature-level frame difference information and realizes the representation of local motion information. Since the multi-module insertion mode directly affects the whole model's final performance, we propose a novel multi-module insertion mode instead of a simple series or parallel connection to ensure that the multiple modules can complement one another and cooperate with each other more efficiently. CLS-Net achieves SOTA performance on the EgoGesture and Jester dataset in the same type of network and achieves competitive results on the Something-Something V2 dataset.

In IoT systems, the use of sensors is considered an important common manner in which all devices communicate with a wireless sensor network to form an information system that comprises a massive number of sensor nodes performing accurately to create a smart decision-making method. However, these sensor nodes might be employed in severe environments, where replacing or recharging their batteries is considered an impossible mission. Simultaneously, the limitation of energy resources in sensor nodes presents a challenging issue that reduces the lifespan of individual nodes and the overall network system as a result of energy depletion. These obstacles necessitate energy-efficient routing protocols. According to the literature review, various routing protocols have been introduced, especially those that use clustering techniques. However, they have many drawbacks due to the way of selecting the cluster head (CH), which results in consuming energy dramatically, and consequently shortening the network lifetime. Additionally, instead of using the static sink, which was inefficient in collecting data, many researchers studied the behavior of the mobile sink (MS), which also has many downsides that negatively impact network performance. This paper presents a novel energy-conscious protocol for clusters that incorporates an adaptive movement for mobile stations and utilizes particle swarm optimization (PSO). The circular network area is divided into clusters, each of which has an elected CH based on the PSO technique. The MS aims to distribute energy among nodes to prevent hotspot issues. To achieve better coverage, it moves in a circular pattern with a constant angular velocity, starting from the center of the network area and moving forward and backward along the radius of the network. This research conducts intensive simulations, which run on MATLAB R2018, to assess the performance of our proposed protocol and compare its results with those of pertinent works. The results obtained are encouraging and demonstrate that the protocol we proposed surpasses its counterparts by significantly extending the lifespan of the network.

AB Manual detection of colorectal polyps in the colonoscopy videos during diagnosis of colorectal cancer can be challenging due to the large no. of sequential frames and high chances of false positive rate. So, researchers are working to develop an automatic computer-aided decision system to successfully detect colorectal polyps for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer. This work proposes an end-to-end, automatic colorectal polyp detection architecture called 'Window-based Detection after Mixed Convolutions Polyp Identification (WD-MCPI)'. It has been trained and validated on the Etis-Larib, CVC-Colon, and Kvasir v1 data. Varying sequential and non-sequential colonoscopy frames and developed occlusive frames have been considered in the test set. Systematic hyperparameter tuning of various convolutional layers, optimizers, kernel size, color space, image dimension, and filter size has been performed to build the proposed architecture. The robustness and explainability of the proposed architecture have been estimated through various evaluation metrics, feature mapping, ablation studies, occlusion testing, and class activation mapping. The proposed work has achieved an overall accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and area-under-curve score up to 94.23, 91.16, 94.00, 92.67, 91.75, and 92.53%, respectively. An average test set accuracy up to 93% has been achieved on a newly developed test set named 'Gastrointestinal atlas-Colon Polyp' (available here). Upon comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works and vanilla inception v3 architecture, the proposed architecture has been tested on varying colonoscopy frames, achieving optimum results with reduced trainable parameters, and inference time per epoch.

AB With the emergence of digitilization, numeric prediction has become a prominent problem in various fields including finance, engineering, industry, and medicine. Among several machine learning methods, regression tree is a widely preferred method due to its simplicity, interpretability and robustness. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel ensemble regression tree based methodology, namely LOF-BRT+OR. The proposed methodology is an integrated solution approach with outlier removal, regression tree and ensemble learning. First, irregular data points are removed using local outlier factor (LOF), which measures the degree of being an outlier for each point. Next, a novel regression tree with LOF weighted node model is introduced. In the proposed node model, the weights of the points in the nodes are determined according to their surrounding neighborhood, as a function of LOF values and neighbor ranks. Finally, in order to increase the prediction performance, ensemble learning is adopted. In particular, bootstrap aggregation is used to generate multiple regression trees with LOF weighted node model. The experimental study shows that the proposed methodology yields the best root mean squared error (RMSE) values in five out of nine data sets. Also, the non-parametric tests demonstrate the statistical significance of the proposed approach over the benchmark methods. The proposed methodology can be applicable to various prediction problems.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Microarray technology presents a challenge due to the large dimensionality of the data, which can be difficult to interpret. To address this challenge, the article proposes a feature extraction-based cancer classification technique coupled with artificial bee colony optimization (ABC) algorithm. The ABC-support vector machine (SVM) method is used to classify the lung cancer datasets and compared them with existing techniques in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy. The proposed ABC-SVM has the advantage of dealing with complex nonlinear data, providing good flexibility. Simulation analysis was conducted with 30% of the data reserved for testing the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed attribute classification technique, which uses fewer genes, performs better than other modalities. The classifiers, such as naive Bayes, multi-class SVM, and linear discriminant analysis, were also compared and the proposed method outperformed these classifiers and state-of-the-art techniques. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of using intelligent algorithms and feature extraction techniques to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis using microarray gene expression data.

AB The infection by SARS-CoV-2 which causes the COVID-19 disease has spread widely over the whole world since the beginning of 2020. Following the epidemic which started in Wuhan, China on January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency and a pandemic. In this paper, we describe a publicly available multiclass CT scan dataset for SARS-CoV-2 infection identification. Which currently contains 4173 CT-scans of 210 different patients, out of which 2168 correspond to 80 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed by RT-PCR. These data have been collected in the Public Hospital of the Government Employees of Sao Paulo and the Metropolitan Hospital of Lapa, both in Sao Paulo - Brazil. The aim of this data set is to encourage the research and development of artificial intelligent methods that are able to identify SARS-CoV-2 or other diseases through the analysis of CT scans. As a baseline result for this data set, we used the recently introduced eXplainable Deep Learning approach (xDNN), which is a transparent deep learning approach that allows users to inspect the decisions of the network.

AB India experienced a 23% rise in podcast listening after the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic and screen fatigue led people to seek their favourite old audio podcasts. Podcast genre classification allows listeners to compile a playlist of their favourite tracks; it also helps podcast streaming services provide recommendations to users based on the genre of the podcasts they enjoy. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for educational content in all forms, including podcasts, has skyrocketed, making it even more crucial to anticipate the genre of educational podcasts. Educational podcasts are a sub-genre of the broader education genre and typically involve audio recordings of discussions, lectures, or interviews on educational topics. Education podcast genre prediction is required to efficiently classify and arrange educational content and make it simpler for listeners to access and absorb pertinent information. This study focuses on Podcast Genre Prediction, specifically for the Hindi language. In this study, our developed PodGen dataset was used, which consists of 550 five-minute podcasts with 26,867 sentences, where every podcast was manually annotated into one of the four genre categories (Horror, Motivational, Crime, and Romance). The performance comparison of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques on the PodGen dataset was used to demonstrate accuracy. The best performance on testing data was observed in the Support Vector Classifier model with balanced accuracy: 82.42%, precision (weighted): 83.09%, recall (weighted): 82.42%, and F1 score (weighted): 82.39%.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Event extraction is an important field in information extraction, which aims to extract key information from unstructured text automatically. Event extraction is mainly divided into trigger identification and classification. The existing models are deficient in sentence representation in the initial word embeddings training process, which makes it difficult to capture the deep bidirectional representation and can't handle the semantic information of the context well, thus affecting the performance of event detection. In this paper, a model BMRMC (BERT + Mean pooling layer + Relative position in multi-head attention + CRF) based on multi-information representation and attention mechanism is proposed. Firstly, the BERT pre-training model based on a bidirectional training transformer is used to embed words and extract word-level features. Then the sentence-level semantic representation is fused by mean pooling layer. In addition, relative position is combined with multi-head attention, which can strengthen the connection of contents. Finally, the sequences are labeled by CRF based on the BIO-labeling mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed model BMRMC improves the performance of event detection, and the F value on the MAVEN dataset is 67.74%, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the general fine-grained event detection task.

AB During the planning stages of new factories for the Body-In-White assembly, the processes used per production system need to be defined. Each production system uses a specific combination of processes, with each process belonging to a main process group. The combination of the processes and groups is subject to restrictions. Since the amount of possible combinations is too large to individually check for restrictions, we propose a Neural Network using an energy measurement derived from Hopfield networks. The proposed network memorizes former correct combinations and provides a recommendation score on how likely a new planned configuration is. Since processes can be paired with processes from their own group or with themselves, the Neural Network is modified to allow loops for joining vertices with themselves. This modification is achieved by adjusting the energy function of Hopfield networks to measure the activation of the combinations of clusters, meaning the edges, and not the activation of vertices during the training phase. We implemented the network for the process planning of factories of a leading European automotive manufacturer, and the results using correct, incorrect, and random process combinations indicate a strong capability of detecting anomalous process combinations.

   BERT; Brazilian federal police documents
AB A document known as notitia criminis (NC) is use in the Brazilian Federal Police as the starting point of the criminal investigation. An NC aims to report a summary of investigative activities. Thus, it contains all relevant information about a supposed crime that occurred. To manage an inquiry and correlate similar investigations, the Federal Police usually needs to extract essential information from an NC document. The manual extraction (reading and understanding the entire content) may be human mentally exhausting, due to the size and complexity of the documents. In this light, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are commonly used for automatic information extraction from textual documents. Deep neural networks are successfully apply to many different NLP tasks. A neural network model that leveraged the results in a wide range of NLP tasks was the BERT model-an acronym for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. In this article, we propose approaches based on the BERT model to extract relevant information from textual documents using automatic text summarization techniques. In other words, we aim to analyze the feasibility of using the BERT model to extract and synthesize the most essential information of an NC document. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches using two real-world datasets: the Federal Police dataset (a private domain dataset) and the Brazilian WikiHow dataset (a public domain dataset). Experimental results using different variants of the ROUGE metric show that our approaches can significantly increase extractive text summarization effectiveness without sacrificing efficiency.

AB In recent years, researchers from academic and industrial fields have become increasingly interested in social network data to extract meaningful information. This information is used in applications such as link prediction between people groups, community detection, protein module identification, etc. Therefore, the clustering technique has emerged as a solution to finding similarities between social network members. Recently, in most graph clustering solutions, the structural similarity of nodes is combined with their attribute similarity. The results of these solutions indicate that the graph's topological structure is more important. Since most social networks are sparse, these solutions often suffer from insufficient use of node features. This paper proposes a hybrid clustering approach as an application for link prediction in heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In our approach, an adjacency vector is determined for each node until, in this vector, the weight of the direct edge or the weight of the shortest communication path among every pair of nodes is considered. A similarity metric is presented that calculates similarity using the direct edge weight between two nodes and the correlation between their adjacency vectors. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed method using DBLP, Political blogs, and Citeseer datasets under entropy, density, purity, and execution time metrics. The simulation results demonstrate that while maintaining the cluster density significantly reduces the entropy and the execution time compared with the other methods.

ID AGREEMENT
AB Legal documents, like contracts or laws, are subject to interpretation. Different people can have different interpretations of the very same document. Large parts of judicial branches all over the world are concerned with settling disagreements that arise, in part, from these different interpretations. In this context, it only seems natural that during the annotation of legal machine learning data sets, disagreement, how to report it, and how to handle it should play an important role. This article presents an analysis of the current state-of-the-art in the annotation of legal machine learning data sets. The results of the analysis show that all of the analysed data sets remove all traces of disagreement, instead of trying to utilise the information that might be contained in conflicting annotations. Additionally, the publications introducing the data sets often do provide little information about the process that derives the "gold standard" from the initial annotations, often making it difficult to judge the reliability of the annotation process. Based on the state-of-the-art, the article provides easily implementable suggestions on how to improve the handling and reporting of disagreement in the annotation of legal machine learning data sets.

AB Currently, the Internet is widely used for shopping. Online reviews have become a crucial factor in helping people to make purchasing decisions. However, the large amount of data overwhelms most users, leading to the problem of information overload. To address this issue, researchers have proposed recommender systems as a solution. The most commonly used method is the collaborative filtering method, which analyzes users' purchase history or behavior to make recommendations. In addition to user ratings, by analyzing users' comments and the relationships between users and items more precise preferences can be obtained. In this study, the aspect-based rating prediction with a hybrid deep learning method (ARPH) is proposed. It consists of five parts: aspect detection, sentiment and semantic analysis, user preference analysis, graph attention network analysis, and rating prediction. It initially extracts the implicit aspect features and aspects' sentiment-semantic features from user and item reviews. The convolutional neural network and matrix factorization methods are then used to generate the predicted ratings of items. Additionally, a graph attention network was built to calculate the predicted ratings based on the relationships between users and items. Finally, a multilayer perceptron was used to automatically adjust the weights for integrating these two predicted ratings. Our method utilizes user-item relationships to predict ratings when there are fewer user reviews. Conversely, the features derived from textual reviews were employed for rating prediction. The experimental results showed that extracting different features is useful in representing user and product preferences. The proposed method effectively improved the accuracy of the rating predictions.

AB This study applies big data processing technology and parallel computing methods to assess the teaching effect of Japanese in the Flipped Classroom (FC) and task-based teaching mode. We propose a model for evaluating the Japanese teaching effect in this mode using feature offset compensation. We employ distributed mining of association rules to detect the teaching effect and extract ontology information and association rules related to the distribution of Japanese teaching effect in the FC and task-based teaching mode. Furthermore, we construct a fuzzy decision-making model for evaluating the teaching effect. The joint information entropy characteristic value of the teaching effect deviation is calculated, and the extracted characteristic quantity is classified and identified using feature deviation compensation and the C-means clustering method. Based on the classification and identification results, we achieve accurate evaluation of the Japanese teaching effect in the FC and task-based teaching mode. Our simulation results demonstrate high precision rates and confidence levels in the evaluation of Japanese teaching effect in this mode.

   Ordinal regression
AB In recent times, deep neural networks achieved outstanding predictive performance on various classification and pattern recognition tasks. However, many real-world prediction problems have ordinal response variables, and this ordering information is ignored by conventional classification losses such as the multi-category cross-entropy. Ordinal regression methods for deep neural networks address this. One such method is the CORAL method, which is based on an earlier binary label extension framework and achieves rank consistency among its output layer tasks by imposing a weight-sharing constraint. However, while earlier experiments showed that CORAL's rank consistency is beneficial for performance, it is limited by a weight-sharing constraint in a neural network's fully connected output layer, which may restrict the expressiveness and capacity of a network trained using CORAL. We propose a new method for rank-consistent ordinal regression without this limitation. Our rank-consistent ordinal regression framework (CORN) achieves rank consistency by a novel training scheme. This training scheme uses conditional training sets to obtain the unconditional rank probabilities through applying the chain rule for conditional probability distributions. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method to utilize the ordinal target information, and the absence of the weight-sharing restriction improves the performance substantially compared to the CORAL reference approach. Additionally, the suggested CORN method is not tied to any specific architecture and can be utilized with any deep neural network classifier to train it for ordinal regression tasks.

DE Path planning; Rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*); Sampling-based

AB The slow convergence rate and large cost of the initial solution limit the performance of rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*). To address this issue, this paper proposes a modified RRT* algorithm (defined as FF-RRT*) that creates an optimal initial solution with a fast convergence rate. An improved hybrid sampling method is proposed to speed up the convergence rate by decreasing the iterations and overcoming the application limitation of the original hybrid sampling method towards concave cavity obstacle. The improved hybrid sampling method combines the goal bias sampling strategy and random sampling strategy, which requires a few searching time, resulting in a faster convergence rate than the existing method. Then, a parent node is created for the sampling node to optimize the path. Finally, the performance of FF-RRT* is validated in four simulation environments and compared with the other algorithms. The FF-RRT* shortens 32% of the convergence time in complex maze environment and 25% of the convergence time in simple maze environment compared to F-RRT*. And in a complex maze with a concave cavity obstacle, the average convergence time of Fast-RRT* in this environment is 134% more than the complex maze environment compared to 12% with F-RRT* and 34% with FF-RRT*. The simulation results show that FF-RRT* possesses superior performance compared to the other algorithms, and also fits with a much more complex environment.

AB Causal discovery algorithms have the potential to impact many fields of science. However, substantial foundational work on the statistical properties of causal discovery algorithms is still needed. This paper presents what is to our knowledge the first method for conducting power analysis for causal discovery algorithms. The power sample characteristics of causal discovery algorithms typically cannot be described by a closed formula, but we resolve this problem by developing a new power sample analysis method based on standardized in silico simulation experiments. Our procedure generates data with carefully controlled statistical effect sizes in order to enable an accurate numerical power sample analysis. We present that method, apply it to generate an initial power analysis table, provide a web interface for searching this table, and show how the table or web interface can be used to solve several types of real-world power analysis problems, such as sample size planning, interpretation of results, and sensitivity analysis.

AB Intrusion Detection (ID) is an essential task in the cyberattacks domain built to secure Internet applications and networks from malicious actors. The main shortcoming of the current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is their attack detection performance because the existing solutions fail to detect the threats efficiently. Therefore, improving the prediction model of the IDS can improve its performance. Several studies suggest improving the Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS prediction models by selecting the most informative features from the security data before utilizing it in the ML-IDS model. Thus, meta-heuristic algorithms such as White Shark Optimizer (WSO) are adapted to deal with such feature selection problems. For the IDS prediction model, in this paper, the WSO algorithm is improved to cope with the binary domain of the feature selection task as follows: Firstly, two transfer functions are used to map the continuous domain into binary. Secondly, the modified K-means algorithm is proposed to assess building the initial population with a high level of diversity. Finally, several crossover operators are utilized to improve the evolution process of the binary WSO. The three improved versions are BIWSO1 which is WSO with transfer functions, BIWSO2, which is BIWSO1 with a modified k-means algorithm, and BIWSO3, which is BIWSO2 with crossover operators. The proposed versions of BIWSO are tested using twelve public real-world IDS and IoT datasets. Comparative evaluations against well-established meta-heuristic algorithms are conducted where the BIWSO3 proves its efficiency in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measurements. For further validation, statistical evidence using Friedman's, Wilcoxon's, and Mann-Whitney U tests has been conducted where BIWSO3 proves its performance at a remarkably significant level.

AB Nowadays, population aging is becoming more and more serious. The elderly occupies a great many of public medical resources, which brings great pressure to the public and governments. Home health care (HHC) is treated as an alternative answer to hospitalization, and plays positive roles in alleviating the stress from the shortage of medical resources incurred by the population aging. Hence, how to effectively manage and organize the operations of HHCs becomes an all-important problem in reality. HHC routing and scheduling problems attract a great deal of interest from modeling and optimization areas. Nevertheless, most of the existing studies just focus on the HHC routing and scheduling problems with a single HHC center. This study focuses on a multi-objective HHC routing and scheduling problem with multiple centers for minimizing total service cost and total tardiness incurred by delay service while meeting caregivers' workload and resource constraints. To cope with it, we establish a mixed integer programming model to formulate the concerned problem. Then, a knowledge-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (KMoEA) is specially designed by employing two local search operators with the properties of the problem. Via comparing KMoEA with five algorithms and a mathematical programming solver (CPLEX), we validate that KMoEA is an effective approach for solving the studied problem. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study presents a competitive algorithm in which the mayfly optimization algorithm (MA) is combined with a local search procedure to provide high-quality solutions to the & alpha;-neighbor p-center problem (& alpha; - pCP). The aim of this problem is to locate p facilities on a plane such that the maximum distance between each demand point and its & alpha;th closest facility is minimized. Although & alpha; - pCP is a discrete optimization problem, it is addressed in this study from the perspective of a continuous optimization problem. The major reason for this choice is that the MA is a very suitable technique for finding the optimum point on a plane. However, it is very difficult to successfully apply this technique to a discrete optimization problem. Hence, additional efforts are made to reduce the computational burden that arises from approaching this from the perspective of a continuous problem. Thus, an effective solution method based on the MA for finding the optimum point on a plane is presented for the discrete & alpha; - pCP. The proposed MA method is compared to the best alternatives found in the literature, which are an extremely efficient exact procedure for the continuous variant of the problem, and a GRASP algorithm that includes a tabu search with strategic oscillation (SO) post-processing. A comparative analysis shows that the performance of the proposed algorithm is similar to that of these state-of-the-art methods. A more extensive comparison shows that the two best performing algorithms, the MA and the SO, complement each other. In addition, the proposed method performs very well for cases where the number of facilities are low. If we consider only the cases where p & LE; 50, we see that the MA performs best 5 times, 14 times and 14 times for & alpha; = 1, 2, 3, respectively, and loses twice, three times, and three times.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The multidimensional multi-way number partitioning problem takes as input a set of n vectors with a fixed dimension m & GE; 2, and aims to find a partitioning of this set into k & GE; 2 non-empty subsets, such that the sums per coordinate across all subsets are as similar as possible. The problem has applications in key encryption, multiprocessor scheduling, minimization of circuit size and delay, and clustering. This paper employs a hybrid meta-heuristic, a self-adaptive version of the Construct, Merge, Solve, and Adapt algorithm equipped with an efficient local search procedure. Local search was able to accelerate the convergence towards promising regions of the search space. A comprehensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm improves over all four competing algorithms from the related literature, especially when it comes to instances with higher k-values, i.e. k & GE; 3. The observed average relative differences are for several instance groups larger than 25% in favor of the proposed algorithm compared to the second-best approach. In fact, a statistical evaluation indicates that our algorithm performs significantly better than the other approaches on all instances with k & GE; 3.

AB Discount offer is one of the widely used strategies of e-commerce retailers to promote sales. However, the success of a discount offer depends on how well inventory levels and discount offers are dynamically managed in relation to each other. In addition, empirical researches have proven that discount offers alter customers' reference prices. However, such alterations are ignored in determining the percentages of discounts despite their importance. This paper proposes a dynamic model determining the optimal discount rates based on the states of inventory and customers' reference prices in online retailing systems. The model also determines when is the optimal time to stop discounts to have inventory under control, by considering the time lag in which the impacts of traces left of discounts in the post-discount period will fade. The results show that choosing the time to stop the discount, by considering inventory dynamics, demand dynamics, and traces left of discounts, helps in maintaining the inventory availability and is more profitable for the retailer compared with another arbitrarily chosen timepoint. Besides, the model identifies the last-instant discount rate as an effective factor in controlling the rate of decrease in reference prices in the post-discount period. The model can help the online retailers to better optimize their discount offers by dynamically adjusting the discounts.

AB Facial action units (AU) have strong mutual correlation. How to explore fine-grained AU regional features from different dimensions while adding inter-AU correlational information is the key to accurate AU detection. In this paper, we propose a novel AU detection framework called MMA-Net based on multi view mixed attention, combining AU-regional information, co-occurrence correlational information and spatially correlational information by adopting a new AU partitioning scheme. Specifically, the proposed multi-view AU partitioning scheme first applies in both the AU co-occurrence correlational view and the facial ROI view to define the co-occurrence and spatially correlational information of AUs. Then, mixed attention, consisting of regional, channel-wise, and spatial attention, is incorporated into the encoder of MMA-Net to extract features from different dimensions. Finally, a pixel-level cross-view contrastive loss is proposed for feature enhancement by differing cross-view features for complement. Experimental results on two widely-used benchmark datasets, namely DISFA and BP4D, demonstrate the superior performance of MMA-Net against the state-of-the-art methods for AU detection.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The capturing of images with poor exposures remains a major source of errors in camera-based photography. Under-or over-exposure problems greatly reduce contrast and naturalness, and the disappearance of detailed content affects the understanding of an image. While recent works have built a great deal of learning frameworks to address this problem, they mainly focus on low-light or general image enhancement. Towards this end, we explore an unsupervised exposure correction framework. Our model disentangles the exposure correction into two easier sub-tasks. Different branches focus on different missions, making it easy for the network to solve coupling correction problems. Additionally, a novel attention-based pixel-wise brightness estimation makes it possible for coarse-to-fine mapping adjustment and correction. Experiments on various widely used benchmark datasets show that, by relying on illumination perception and component divided guidance, the proposed network can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods, especially when recovering fine detailed contents. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Nighttime pedestrian detection; Channel attention mechanism;
   Fore-Background Contrast Attention
AB The significance of background information is frequently overlooked in contemporary research con-cerning channel attention mechanisms. This study addresses the issue of suboptimal single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection performance under low-light conditions by incorporating background information into the channel attention mechanism. Despite numerous studies focusing on the devel-opment of efficient channel attention mechanisms, the relevance of background information has been largely disregarded. By adopting a contrast learning approach, we reexamine channel attention with regard to pedestrian objects and background information for nighttime pedestrian detection, resulting in the proposed Fore-Background Contrast Attention (FBCA). FBCA possesses two primary attributes: (1) channel descriptors form remote dependencies with global spatial feature information; (2) the integra-tion of background information enhances the distinction between channels concentrating on low-light pedestrian features and those focusing on background information. Consequently, the acquired channel descriptors exhibit a higher semantic level and spatial accuracy. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that FBCA significantly outperforms existing methods in single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NightOwls and TJU-DHD-pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, this methodology also yields performance improvements for the multispectral LLVIP dataset. These findings indicate that integrating background information into the channel attention mechanism effectively mitigates detector performance degradation caused by illumination factors in nighttime scenarios.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE One-shot semantic segmentation; Cross-domain problem; Adversarial
   learning; Meta-learning
AB The purpose of one-shot semantic segmentation is to classify all pixels in a query image with a labeled support sample. Its current approaches divide data into two disjoint parts, a training set and a testing set. When the training and testing data are from different domains, the migration of the trained model to the testing data for prediction tends to perform less efficiently. Therefore, through the introduction of a distribution alignment module, a new dual-channel network (DCNet) for one-shot segmentation is proposed in this paper. The purpose of this introduction is to alleviate the performance degradation caused by distribution differences between the datasets. Furthermore, a soft pseudo-mask based prototype refinement module with Gumbel-Softmax is designed to enhance the expressive ability of prototypes and improve segmentation performance. Experiments are made on four datasets with large distribution differences, proving that our approach outperforms the compared methods by a large margin.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum computers, known to have the potential for exponential speedup in solving some problems due to their superposition property, are expected to facilitate the solution of NP-hard optimisation problems. This study proposes a quantum algorithm to solve the weapon target assignment problem (WTAP), one of the NP-hard optimisation problems. The proposed quantum algorithm is a gate-based approach, and scenario examples are executed on Qiskit quantum computing platform and IBM Lima quantum computer with Falcon r4T processor type. The results manifest that the proposed quantum algorithm has low space and time complexity, demonstrating its memory and computational resources efficiency.

AB Implementing monitoring electricity consumption strategies in industrial environments provides improvements in both the maintenance process and energy efficiency. The contribution of this work is an industry-oriented non-intrusive load monitoring approach based on an unsupervised algorithm, encompassing a method of event detection, functional data clustering, and condition monitoring. With this method, multiple devices can be monitored by only one electric meter in industrial environments, enhancing the early detection of anomalies and energy inefficiencies. The proposed approach presents a robust event detection to deal with different industrial contexts due to its intuitive parameters, which allows adapting the detection to be more sensitive or to filter out higher noise variations. Unlike other feature-based clusterings, the proposed functional data clustering enables high-precision identification of transient state patterns, characterizing specific shapes for each pattern to properly cluster them, and provides higher reliability during load detection. Thus, this load detection segments the power consumption to extract transient states and identify which load acts on each event based on functional data clusters. By detecting when loads start to consume, the proposed energy disaggregation extracts the frequency spectrum of each device from the aggregate current consumption, which is used in a condition monitoring strategy to track the spectrum behavior of each device. In this way, the condition of multiple loads can be monitored using a single electric meter, whose information can be relevant to accurately schedule maintenance interventions and detect anomalies or inefficiencies early. The proposed approach was validated in three industrial contexts: The load detection accuracy was verified in an industrial testbed, giving a precision higher than 99% for monitoring five devices. The second and third industrial scenarios validate the accuracy of the proposed condition monitoring method. The last scenario was carried out at Bilbao airport to track the condition of multiple conveyor belts of a baggage handling system located at check-in. As a result, the degradation trend of three sets of conveyor belts was monitored.

AB In this study, we integrate deep neural network (DNN) with hybrid approaches (feature selection and instance clustering) to build prediction models for predicting mortality risk in patients with COVID-19. Besides, we use cross-validation methods to evaluate the performance of these prediction models, including feature based DNN, cluster-based DNN, DNN, and neural network (multi-layer perceptron). The COVID-19 dataset with 12,020 instances and 10 cross-validation methods are used to evaluate the prediction models. The experimental results showed that the proposed feature based DNN model, holding Recall (98.62%), F1-score (91.99%), Accuracy (91.41%), and False Negative Rate (1.38%), outperforms than original prediction model (neural network) in the prediction performance. Furthermore, the proposed approach uses the Top 5 features to build a DNN prediction model with high prediction performance, exhibiting the well prediction as the model built by all features (57 features). The novelty of this study is that we integrate feature selection, instance clustering, and DNN techniques to improve prediction performance. Moreover, the proposed approach which is built with fewer features performs much better than the original prediction models in many metrics and can still remain high prediction performance.

AB Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices and systems are often designed without adequate security, leaving them highly susceptible to cyber threats. Unlike other IoT applications and devices, cyber attacks against IoMT devices will pose significant risks to patient safety. As a result of the progress made in attack detection through machine learning, numerous applications of machine learning are now involved in IoMT. However, how to securely collect and fuse the data from heterogeneous IoMT devices and systems and ensure efficient cyber-attack detection while avoiding the privacy disclosure of the dataset remains challenging for IoMT systems. To fill this gap, a new privacy-aware framework is advised for storing the collected IoMT data in distributed cloud nodes and providing data fusion of heterogeneous IoMT data using differential privacy and deep learning and efficient attack detection using quantum deep learning with maintaining data privacy. Specifically, the proposed privacy-aware framework provides sensitive data privacy protection at multi-levels starting from storing data in distributed cloud nodes with privacy-preserving and then fusing IoMT heterogeneous data using deep contractive autoencoder with differential privacy for protecting the sensitive data through the learning process and then using the output of data fusion which is reduced data dimension as input for a quantum neural network for identifying cyber-attacks. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed framework is highly effective in detecting cyber-attacks.

   Uncertainty prediction; High-confidence
AB Most unsupervised domain adaptation approaches learn domain-invariant features assuming that source and target domain data are available simultaneously. In practice, the availability of source samples is only sometimes possible. This paper establishes a novel source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) framework based on uncertainty prediction and a neighborhood-guided evidence-based contrastive learning scheme. First, we develop an evidence analyzer based on the uncertainty prediction principle of Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, which improves the network capability for discriminating different types of samples. The transformer layer with a self-attention module is adopted to capture long-distance feature dependencies such that the proposed network has better generalization ability on multiple domains. Then, we offer a high-confidence target domain sample (HCS) acquisition strategy through evidence theory, entropy criterion, and distance information. A joint confidence enhancement scheme obtains the final HCS that generates pseudo-labels. Finally, we propose an optimization method based on evidence theory, evidence-based comparative learning, and internal neighborhood structure to ensure the separability between classes and compactness within categories. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs superiorly on two standard datasets on multiple adaptation tasks.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The prediction of community evolution events in dynamic social networks is of great importance for network security alerts. Currently, most of the common prediction models use a fixed timeframe division strategy to divide the dynamic social network, such as the disjoint timeframe division strategy and overlapping timeframe division strategy. However, these frameworks cannot change once they are selected, and are not suitable for the prediction of network evolution with strong variability in real-world applications. In this paper, a new community evolution model is developed from the perspective of the universality of the timeframe, and a new optimized timeframe partitioning algorithm is proposed. Compared with the traditional fixed timeframe partitioning algorithm, this method adaptively adjusts the size and number of time windows according to the information fluctuations of the specific network at an acceptable extra computational cost. Based on the analysis of several real -world networks, we found that the proposed self-adaptive timeframe partitioning algorithm improved the quality of community tracking of the network and ensured the accuracy of prediction events.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID INFORMATION; NETWORK
AB Facial microexpression recognition (FMER) has recently gained increasing attention in the interrogation and clinical diagnosis fields. However, accurate FMER suffers from not only the low-intensity muscle movements and a short duration of microexpressions but also limited training data. To address the abovementioned issues, this paper employs facial u/v/s images to explore short durationlow-intensity muscle movements, which can be extracted from the expression flow. Specifically, we propose a motion detail enhancement method to disentangle microexpression-irrelevant motions from the expression flow. Then, a novel data augmentation strategy based on different u-v weights is introduced to generate diverse s components, resolving the limited scale issue. Afterward, the enhanced facial u/v/s images are fed to a novel local-diverse facial microexpression recognition network (LD-FMERN) for microexpression-related feature extraction, where a spatial-channel modulator is used to refine the extracted features. A locally diverse feature mining strategy further enhances the refined features, forcing the network to focus on small and diverse facial regions. Following the law of human vision, we propose an adaptive loss function, which comprises a supervised cross-entropy loss and a self-supervised local-diverse loss, to optimize the network. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets, CASMEII, SAMM, and MMEW, demonstrate the improvements. Comparisons with state-of-the-art FMER methods reveal the superiority of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Out-of-distribution; Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Capsule endoscopy
AB While deep learning has displayed excellent performance in a broad spectrum of application areas, neural networks still struggle to recognize what they have not seen, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In the medical field, building robust models that are able to detect OOD images is highly critical, as these rare images could show diseases or anomalies that should be detected. In this study, we use wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images to present a novel patch-based self-supervised approach comprising three stages. First, we train a triplet network to learn vector representations of WCE image patches. Second, we cluster the patch embeddings to group patches in terms of visual similarity. Third, we use the cluster assignments as pseudolabels to train a patch classifier and use the Out-of-Distribution Detector for Neural Networks (ODIN) for OOD detection. The system has been tested on the Kvasir-capsule, a publicly released WCE dataset. Empirical results show an OOD detection improvement compared to baseline methods. Our method can detect unseen pathologies and anomalies such as lymphangiectasia, foreign bodies and blood with AUROC > 0.6. This work presents an effective solution for OOD detection models without needing labeled images.

AB The development of industry has led to the big data revolution in manufacturing industry, which has greatly improved production quality and efficiency. A accuracy prediction model is established by using deep learning method, especially short and long term memory (LSTM). However, the application field of LSTM is usually very limited, and the interpretability of LSTM is weak. In this paper, a novel bidirectional DiPLS based LSTM algorithm (BiDiPLS-LSTM) is proposed to solve this problem. First, DiPLS is used to process the forward time series data to obtain the most predictable dynamic latent variable (DLV) of the target variable. At the same time, DiPLS method is also used to process the reverse time series data and extract the reverse DLV. Then, the forward and reverse dynamic features of the same location will form new input data, and this new input data will be input into the LSTM network to realize the prediction of time series data. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed BiDiPLS-LSTM method, the real 660 MW coal-fired boiler process data is used, and the emission of oxides of nitrogen (NO ������) is regarded as the output. The results show that the extracted dynamic features can be used to build a very accuracy model, and the results outperform the traditional LSTM method, the PLS-LSTM method, the unidirectional DiPLS-LSTM method, and traditional RNN method in the comparison. For the first time, we used the bidirectional dynamic features of the input data as the real input to predict the output, which will obtain a good prediction effect. What is more, the use of dynamic latent variables made the result more explanatory.

AB Originating from model-free reinforcement learning (RL), many modern multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are usually armed with the paradigm of Centralized Training with De-centralized Execution (CTDE) to mitigate the non-stationary problem and make the training process stable. However, these methods still suffer from sample inefficiency and slow training convergence as in the single-agent reinforcement learning setting. Many common methods aiming to tackle these problems utilize the experience buffer and parallel training mechanism to speed up the training process, which would cost more computing resources and may still underuse the sampled experiences. In this paper, we propose Regularization -Adapted Anderson Acceleration (RA3) for model-free, off-policy MARL algorithms. Under the CTDE paradigm, this specific RA3 approach treats the joint action-value function update as a fixed-point iteration task and speeds up the training process with the same amount of sampled experiences as in the baseline algorithms. Furthermore, our RA3 employs an adaptive regularization strategy related to Bellman residuals to stabilize the update process and enhance the training performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the improved learning speed and superior performance of our proposed method are significantly improved on the predator-prey game and the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, due to wide potential applications like human-computer interactions, eye center detection has received growing research interest. Although numerous approaches have been proposed, achieving high accuracy in the wild remains challenging because of the variations in appearance, shape, and illumination. In this paper, we formulate the eye center detection problem as an approximate segmentation task. We propose a novel method to detect pupil positions from a face image using a deep neural network with synthetic data. In particular, we introduce a deep neural network named Multiscale-Attention-Link Network (MAL-Net), where we design a Link Attention Module (LAM) and a novel Multiscale Link Structure (MLS) for accurate and robust eye center detection. Besides, a weighted loss is proposed to make the deep model pay more attention to eye centers during training. Furthermore, to address the problem of insufficient training data with enough variations in eye shape and illumination, we propose a GAN-based method named shape-GAN to generate synthetic eye images with various shapes for training. The proposed MAL-Net is evaluated on widely-used benchmarks such as TFV, GI4E, and BioID. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for eye center detection.

TI Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation via

SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; Semantic segmentation; CNN
AB Semantic segmentation requires a lot of training data, which necessitates costly annotation. There have been many studies on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) from one domain to another, e.g., from computer graphics to real images. However, there is still a gap in accuracy between UDA and supervised training on native domain data. It is arguably attributable to the class-level misalignment between the source and target domain data. To cope with this, we propose a method that applies adversarial training to align two feature distributions in the target domain. It uses a self-training framework to split the image into two regions (i.e., trusted and untrusted), which form two distributions to align in the feature space. We term this approach cross-region adaptation (CRA) to distinguish it from the previous methods of aligning different domain distributions, which we call cross-domain adaptation (CDA). CRA can be applied after any CDA method. Experimental results show that this always improves the accuracy of the combined CDA method.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Group detection is a crucial yet challenging task in various application domains, including video surveillance analysis and service robot interactions. Previous studies have struggled with complicated group structures and diverse human behaviors, resulting in low performance in multiple activity group detections. In this article, we propose a two-branch deep learning framework with spatial and pose constraints that combines physical proximity and social behavior to improve group detection performance. Specifically, we design an original Variable Group Detection Transform Network (VGDTN) that integrates dyad representations and contextual information to recognize complex group arrangements. Additionally, we present a novel pose-based refined clustering module that efficiently explores human behavior within multiple activity group detections by utilizing ternary postures classification. To address the computational intensity of DL-based methods in extensive surveillance video analysis, a designed lightweight VGDTN which consists of NIN blocks maintains good performance while reducing the computational burden. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 7%, 5%, 2%, and 4% in F1_score (T = 1) on four public datasets.

   Action recognition; Smart classroom; Intelligent education
AB With the development of multimedia technologies, surveillance videos and other multimedia data have received widespread attention in several fields. Surveillance videos can monitor students' learning statuses in real time. However, the current action recognition methods for teaching have limitations. First, the ethical privacy of AI and education makes public datasets on student behavior scarce. Therefore, based on the summarization of seven typical student behaviors in the classroom, course videos were obtained from the smart classroom to gen-erate a dataset of student behavior. Compared with existing student behavior recognition datasets, the proposed dataset is distinguished by cluttered backgrounds, crowded scenes, and occlusions. Second, relational reasoning using existing methods is not ideal for distinguishing between students' body parts and small objects in a cluttered background; the interactive utilization rate of different relational features is low, and it cannot take ad-vantage of the complementarity of different relational features, resulting in poor performance of interaction ac-tion recognition. Therefore, the attention-based relational reasoning module strengthens the interactive representation between small objects and human body parts. At the same time, considering that there is a certain complementary relationship between relational features, this study constructs a relational feature fusion module which models a human-to-human interaction relationship built upon supporting human's body part and sur-rounding context. Finally, the reconstructed features and human-appearance features were fused to achieve ac-curate interactive action recognition. Through an experimental comparison between the proposed and current mainstream algorithms on the generated student behavior dataset, it was verified that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in action recognition.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Allocating resources to individuals in a fair manner has been a topic of interest since ancient times, with most of the early mathematical work on the problem focusing on resources that are infinitely divisible. Over the last decade, there has been a surge of papers studying computational questions regarding the indivisible case, for which exact fairness notions such as envy-freeness and proportionality are hard to satisfy. One main theme in the recent research agenda is to investigate the extent to which their relaxations, like maximin share fairness (MMS) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX), can be achieved. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of the recent progress made in the related literature by highlighting different ways to relax fairness notions, common algorithm design techniques, and the most interesting questions for future research. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB One of the key technologies in smart cities is the use of next generation networks such as 5G networks. Mainly because this new mobile technology offers massive connections in densely populated areas in smart cities, thus playing a crucial role for numerous subscribers anytime and anywhere. Indeed, all the most important infrastructure to promote a connected world is being related to next generation networks. Specifically, the small cells transmitters is one of the 5G technologies more relevant to provide more connections and to attend the high demand in smart cities. In this article, a smart small cell positioning is proposed in the context of a smart city. The work proposal aims to do this through the development of a hybrid clustering algorithm with meta-heuristic optimizations to serve users, with real data, of a region satisfying coverage criteria. Furthermore, the problem to be solved will be the best location of the small cells, with the minimization of attenuation between the base stations and its users. The possibilities of using multi-objective optimization algorithms based on bioinspired computing, such as Flower Pollination and Cuckoo Search, will be verified. It will also be analyzed by simulation which power values would allow the continuity of the service with emphasis on three 5G spectrums used around the world: 700 MHz, 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz.

AB High dimension and complexity of network high-dimensional data lead to poor feature selection effect network high-dimensional data. To effectively solve this problem, feature selection algorithms for high-dimensional network data based on supervised discriminant projection (SDP) have been designed. The sparse representation problem of high-dimensional network data is transformed into an Lp norm optimization problem, and the sparse subspace clustering method is used to cluster high-dimensional network data. Dimensionless processing is carried out for the clustering processing results. Based on the linear projection matrix and the best transformation matrix, the dimensionless processing results are reduced by combining the SDP. The sparse constraint method is used to achieve feature selection of high-dimensional data in the network, and the relevant feature selection results are obtained. The experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested algorithm can effectively cluster seven different types of data and converges when the number of iterations approaches 24. The F1 value, recall, and precision are all kept at high levels. High-dimensional network data feature selection accuracy on average is 96.9%, and feature selection time on average is 65.1 milliseconds. The selection effect for network high-dimensional data features is good.

AB Many real-world problems can be naturally formulated as discrete multi-objective optimisation (DMOO) problems. We have proposed a novel Physarum-inspired competition algorithm (PCA) to tackle these DMOO problems. Our algorithm is based on hexagonal cellular automata (CA) as a representation of problem search space and reaction-diffusion systems that control the Physarum motility. Physarum's decision-making power and the discrete properties of CA have made our algorithm a perfectly suitable approach to solve DMOO problems. Each cell in the CA grid will be decoded as a solution (objective function) and will be regarded as a food resource to attract Physarum. The n-dimensional generalisation of the hexagonal CA grid has allowed us to extend the solving capabilities of our PCA from only 2-D to n-D optimisation problems. We have implemented a novel restart procedure to select the global Pareto frontier based on both personal experience and shared information. Extensive experimental and statistical analyses were conducted on several benchmark functions to assess the performance of our PCA against other evolutionary algorithms. As far as we know, this study is the first attempt to assess algorithms that solve DMOO problems, with a large number of benchmark functions and performance indicators. Our PCA has confirmed our assumption that individual skills of competing Physarum are more efficient in exploration and increase the diversity of the solutions. It has achieved the best performance for the Spread indicator (diversity), similar performance results compared to the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) and even outperformed other well-established genetic algorithms.

AB The ranking of fuzzy numbers is vital in decision-making problems involving qualitative information and some fuzzy mathematical models. With the classical set theory, decision-making is challenging when it involves many uncertainties or qualitative information. This paper uses the proposed ranking principle for generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (GTrFNs) to solve problems with imprecise information or uncertainty. There are multitudes of methods available for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers (GFNs), some of which have shortcomings. A few recent approaches involving centroid point, magnitude, distance, etc., to ordering GFNs have some drawbacks in ranking arbitrary GTrFNs. In this paper, we propose a new ranking principle based on the mean score and diagonal distance score function to overcome the shortcomings of a few existing ranking approaches. In this paper, we also demonstrate how well the suggested model works as a tool for selecting suppliers for an MCDM under a fuzzy environment. In addition, we show the effectiveness of the proposed ranking principle in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems using the modified fuzzy TOPSIS method. For this, an illustrative example of a hotel supplier section of electrical appliances illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed ranking principle.

AB The enterprise intellectual property data management specification system based on machine learning is a modern approach to managing and analyzing large amounts of data. Machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, can be used to classify and query data, providing a more efficient and accurate way to manage intellectual property data. The system is built using a neural network as an encoder and decoder, which can be trained to classify and reconstruct the data. For binary classification problems, the cross-entropy is used as the loss function to measure the error between the reconstructed data and the original data. And the joint probability density of the entire database table is approximately expressed by improving the automatic encoder to handle a variety of approximate queries. In order to ensure the balance of data samples, a comprehensive connection sampling framework is adopted in the sampling process, which can select different samples with uniform distribution from the complex scenes of dynamic database for analysis. Considering the different types of data, the quantitative data are evaluated with the help of standardized data processing methods. In order to test the accuracy of the data classification model, the confusion matrix method is used to predict and classify each class of representative samples to judge the accuracy and error rate of sample data prediction. Finally, the performance of the enterprise intellectual property data management standard system is evaluated and compared with the time of manual preparation of enterprise intellectual property data management, which proves the feasibility of the system and the effectiveness of efficiency improvement.

AB The times are developing and society is progressing. In recent years, the level of random science and technology has been continuously improved, and the application of artificial intelligence technology has become more and more common in people's lives. The further combination of artificial intelligence and art design has also largely optimized the methods and expressions of art design. This article takes the decentralization of art design in the era of artificial intelligence as the main research object, and conducts an in-depth discussion and analysis of the performance and causes of art design, aiming to study the influence of artificial intelligence technology on the development of human art design in the future. This article first takes the causes of the decentralization phenomenon produced by art design as the research object, and conducts a specific analysis of the development of art design, including the extension of art design related to artificial intelligence technology, and the aesthetics of neural network technology to the public. Then, we also analyzed the specific impact of neural network intelligent technology on customer groups and customer thinking, as well as its specific embodiment in the content of art design. In the end, we came to the conclusion that although the communication method of artificial intelligence is conducive to the personalized development of art design in many aspects, it is influenced by the mass media and the specific mode of communication in the process of use, resulting in artificial intelligence technology in art. There is great innovation ability in design. Therefore, for professional art designers, they should not only complete their own commercial art design tasks, but also make contributions and efforts for the prosperity of art on this basis.

AB The rapid development of urbanization has caused a series of urban problems, such as excessive use of land resources, unreasonable energy consumption and so on. These problems have caused a lot of waste of resources, which is not conducive to sustainable development. Cities waste a lot of energy at will, not only aggravating environmental pollution, but also hindering the normal life of residents and urban development. Scientifically and accurately measuring urban energy efficiency, understanding the current status and changing trends of urban energy efficiency in China, and clarifying differences in urban energy efficiency are important for improving urban energy utilization. In this paper, soft computing is used to further study the factors that affect energy efficiency, and it is reasonable to clarify the direction of energy efficiency improvement, which plays an important role in improving urban energy efficiency and formulating energy policies. In this article, we will analyze land use. Construction is a long-term and complex system project. This is a summary of past social and economic development experiences and lessons, and a corresponding strategic choice under the premise of redefining the relationship between environment and development. Therefore, before implementation, strategic environmental assessment must control the emergence of environmental problems from the very beginning, which will have important theoretical and practical significance. Policy assessment, as a form of strategic environmental assessment, accounts for most of the cases that have been implemented. Through the research of soft computing, this paper applies it to the energy utilization of green cities.

AB Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can be identified via MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Scans, CT (Computerized Tomography) Scans, and clinical parameters including Serum creatinine levels, Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR), Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), Blood Pressure, Family History, etc. Existing models that perform such multimodal analysis are either highly complex, require larger data samples, or have lower efficiency when applied to clinical scenarios. To overcome these issues, this paper presents a novel approach for pre-emptive identification of CKD using a multimodal engine that leverages incremental transfer learning on clinical data samples. Our approach combines multiple modalities of data, including laboratory test results, demographic information, MRI scans, CT scans and medical history, to improve the accuracy of CKD prediction under clinical scenarios. We use an incremental transfer learning algorithm that extracts LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and autoencoder (AE)-based features and uses 1D convolutional neural network (1DCNN), with 2D CNN, to learn from new data samples and update the model via correlative analysis. This results in improved performance when evaluated over temporal sample sets. Experiments done on clinical data samples demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods and achieves high accuracy in identifying CKD at an early stage, which could enable timely interventions and improve patient's health conditions. Our multimodal engine is able to achieve 8.5% higher accuracy of prediction, 6.4% higher precision of pre-emption, and 4.5% higher recall of prediction when compared with existing models, thus making it a deployable solution for pre-emptive identification of CKD using clinical scans and data samples.

AB Spinal cord diseases have grown exponentially over the past decade, which is majorly due to improper sitting postures, lack of exercise, and daily life routines. These characteristics when coupled with depression, anxiety and other psychological issues result in various types of cancers. A wide variety of models are proposed by researchers to detect these cancers and their side effects, but a very few of these models are targeted towards correlative identification of spinal cord cancer with cervical diseases. Moreover, the models that propose such techniques are highly complex and showcase low efficiency when applied to clinical scan sets. To overcome these issues, this text proposes design of a novel deep dyna-Q Network (DDQN) for spinal cord tumour classification to identify cervical diseases. These diseases include cervical cancer, cervical dysplasia, cervical stenosis, cervical herniated disc, cervical spondylosis, cervical radiculopathy, cervical osteoarthritis, and cervical teratomas. The proposed model initially collects temporal spinal cord scans, blood reports, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, each of which are represented into multidomain feature sets. These feature sets were evaluated differently for blood report & image scans and then aggregated in order to obtain a combined feature vector, which can be used for classification & other analysis. The aggregated features are selected via a grey wolf optimizer (GWO), which assists in retaining high inter-class variance feature sets. The selected features are classified using a DDQN which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines model-based and model-free learning on clinical data sets. It uses a deep Q-learning to update estimates of the action-value function and fuses it with a model-based approach to learn about correlation between tumour & cervical diseases. The model also generates temporal signature patterns, which is used to update the Q-value sets. This combination of model-based and model-free methods allows the deep dyna-Q to learn faster and more effectively than other methods. The model was tested on standard BioGPS, spinal cord injury (SCI), and correlated blood report data sets, and it was observed that the model was capable of achieving 4.9% higher accuracy, 3.5% higher precision, and 4.5% higher recall of tumour identification when compared with existing methods. The model was also able to reduce the delay needed for identification of these diseases, which makes it useful for a wide variety of clinical scenarios.

AB Security of data has always been a big problem in information technology. Because the data are stored in a variety of locations, including all over the world, this problem becomes even more pressing in the context of cloud computing. Concerns about cloud technology stem primarily from users' concerns regarding data security and privacy. The heterogeneity of cloud resources and the numerous shared applications they serve can benefit from effective scheduling. Goal of this study is to improve cloud soft computing's resource allocation and data protection using a secure channel model and machine learning architecture combined with distributed social networks. The cloud architecture data protection in the proposed network model is accomplished by developing the channel model using hierarchical lightweight cryptography analysis. Then, Q-bayes propagation quantum networks are used to allocate resources. Memory capacity, data protection analysis, throughput, end-end delay, and processing time are all used in experimental analysis. Proposed technique attained memory capacity of 73%, data protection analysis of 69%, throughput of 95%, end-end delay of 69%, processing time of 49%.

AB Landscaping and design are designed to meet the needs of people for leisure, entertainment, production and life. The natural landscape is the main part and combined with artificial beautification technology to create a space landscape. Modern planning and design mainly focus on environmental protection and the sustainable development of natural resources. As a natural way of human communication, speech has inherent advantages as a means of human-computer interaction. Automatic speech recognition should enable computers to "understand" human speech and convert speech sequences into text sequences. With the development of deep learning, speech recognition based on deep neural networks has become more and more common. There are currently two frameworks for internal speech recognition modeling: hybrid framework and end-to-end architecture. In this case, this work focuses on the various problems of speech recognition modeling in the two architectures. Based on local topographic maps, remote sensing image maps and various baseline survey data, this paper explores the planning area, uses technology to extract and analyze the spatial data of the research area, and create digital elevation models, remote sensing images, and maps. The sounding above forms a virtual three-dimensional environment of the study area. On this basis, the landscape elements are analyzed from the perspectives, topography and spatial pattern to create urban landscapes. The planning and design are based on a comprehensive and intuitive spatial model, which is used to formulate a reasonable anti-urban security plan, with the landscape map of the area as a reference point.

AB At present, market competition is increasingly encouraging, and the profit space of intermediary agents in the supply chain is constantly being compressed. In the current environment, the disadvantages of traditional business models are becoming more and more obvious, and the profitability of enterprises is becoming weaker, so they are gradually unable to adapt to changing market demands. As the most widely used marketing method currently, online marketing is of great significance to the development of the financial market. This paper introduces a novel online marketing effect analysis model that combines machine learning and multi-model fusion technology to enhance the prediction accuracy and robustness of the model. By constructing a multi-model structure, the information of the data can be more fully expressed in the feature space, thereby improving the accuracy of the model's predictions. The model structure is also simplified, which not only improves the online prediction speed but also enhances the prediction accuracy of the model through the integration method. In addition, this paper analyzes the effect of the model with examples and verifies the role of the model in the online marketing effect analysis.

AB Embedding data in hyperbolic spaces has proven beneficial for many advanced machine learning applications. However, working in hyperbolic spaces is not without difficulties as a result of its curved geometry (e.g., computing the Frechet mean of a set of points requires an iterative algorithm). In Euclidean spaces, one can resort to kernel machines that not only enjoy rich theoretical properties but that can also lead to superior representational power (e.g., infinite-width neural networks). In this paper, we introduce valid kernel functions for hyperbolic representations. This brings in two major advantages, 1. kernelization will pave the way to seamlessly benefit the representational power from kernel machines in conjunction with hyperbolic embeddings, and 2. the rich structure of the Hilbert spaces associated with kernel machines enables us to simplify various operations involving hyperbolic data. That said, identifying valid kernel functions on curved spaces is not straightforward and is indeed considered an open problem in the learning community. Our work addresses this gap and develops several positive definite kernels in hyperbolic spaces (modeled by a Poincare ball), the proposed kernels include the rich universal ones (e.g., Poincare RBF kernel), or realize the multiple kernel learning scheme (e.g., Poincare radial kernel). We comprehensively study the proposed kernels on a variety of challenging tasks including few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, person re-identification, deep metric learning, knowledge distillation and self-supervised learning. The consistent performance gain over different tasks shows the benefits of the kernelization for hyperbolic representations.

AB Stack Overflow is a Q & A website that is popular among developers and extensively used in software engineering (SE) research. A significant body of research has examined how Stack Overflow can assist with software development tasks, such as recommending APIs. However, while researchers have recognized the importance of Stack Overflow in SE research related to software development tasks, the specific ways in which it is utilized and the reasons for its widespread usage in research have not been thoroughly explored. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted the first study to understand the role of Stack Overflow in assisting with SE research regarding software development tasks by systematically examining relevant and high-quality research works. Meanwhile, we carried out a qualitative survey to gain insight into why researchers choose to utilize Stack Overflow in SE research and to solicit suggestions for the better use of Stack Overflow in research. The study identifies trends in the research area, prominent researchers and organizations, and the types of tasks that utilize Stack Overflow in research, with coding and debugging being the most common. Moreover, it examines how Stack Overflow data is utilized in SE research regarding software development tasks, including searching, training models, and mining associations. Our qualitative survey of researchers indicates that the popularity of Stack Overflow stems from its comprehensive explanations of technical topics that are often not found in documentation or manuals. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of Stack Overflow in SE research regarding software development tasks, and offer actionable implications for both researchers and stakeholders of Stack Overflow to facilitate future research and improvements.

AB Multi-document summarization (MDS) has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing MDS systems simply encode the flat connected sequence of multiple documents, which limits the representation capabilities for multi-documents. To address this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Document Summarization Model with Global-Local Document Dependencies (HierMDS). HierMDS consists of five sub-blocks, i.e., an embedding block, an internal document encoding block, a local document encoding block, a global document encoding block, and a fusion block, which are stacked in a hierarchical structure to gradually produce dependency-enriched document representations. Specifically, the embedding block encodes tokens, and the internal document encoding block encodes each document. Then, for a certain document, two kinds of document dependencies are extracted: (1) The global document dependency indicates that the representation of this document is affected by all the other documents. (2) The local document dependency indicates that the representation of this document is only affected by the relevant documents. We suppose that the global document dependency represents the global background information, while the local document dependency condenses the most relevant information. To be specific, the global document encoding block modeled with the vanilla transformer layer encodes the global document dependencies, and the local document encoding block modeled with the graph attention neural networks encodes the local document dependencies. Finally, HierMDS produces document dependency-enriched representations by fusing the local and global document dependencies with the fusion block. Experimental results on Multi-News and DUC-2004 datasets have demonstrated competitive advantages of HierMDS compared with several state-of-the-art MDS models.

ID PCB LAYOUT
AB Layout generation is frequently encountered in the field of mechanical design. The direct application of generative adversarial network, which was originally used to generate pixel-level images, usually cannot guarantee the interrelation between components such as the non-overlap requirement. In addition, the number and the size of components cannot be precisely controlled. These all constitute the characteristics of mechanical layout. To address the above problems, we propose a hierarchical layout generation generative adversarial network (LGGAN) for mechanical layout generation. The layout generator consists of three modules. The first is hierarchical layout generation, where the shape and distribution of components are generated separately using two neural networks. Such a hierarchical structure greatly improves the generation capacity. To reduce the accumulated noise when multiple components are added, a denoiser is included as the second module. The third module is a refinement step used to fine-tune the layouts, which adjusts the size of each component to the prescribed value. All of the three modules are neural network-based, and can be trained through backpropagation. Additionally, an active learning strategy for training the LGGAN is proposed, which allows LGGAN to converge with a small amount of training data in situations where getting a significant amount of training data is not possible. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LGGAN.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been preliminarily applied to run-to-run (RtR) control. However, the existing works have mainly conducted on shift and drift disturbances in the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process and have not taken the non-stationary time-series disturbances into full consideration. Inspiring from the powerful self-learning mechanism of DRL, a new distributional reinforcement learning controller, quantile option structure deep deterministic policy gradient (QUOTA-DDPG), is designed to generate control policies without precise numerical model in this work. Specifically, the procedure for adjusting the recipe is formulated as a Markovian decision process. Meanwhile, state, action and reward are reasonably designed. Regarding QUOTA-DDPG, an option is first determined based on the option strategy, and the action is decided via intra-option policy at each time step. Moreover, target network and empirical replay mechanisms are utilized to enhance the stability and trainability. Simulations demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms the existing methods regarding the disturbance compensation and target tracking. The application of QUOTA-DDPG controller enriches the development of semiconductor smart manufacturing.

AB The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most commonly injured ligaments in the knee. Accurate tear quantification of ACL plays a crucial role in the treatment of patients. This study aims to propose an auxiliary diagnosis scheme based on deep learning (DL) to assist orthopedic surgeons in automatic ACL tear localization and quantification. The proposed scheme adopted a decoupled generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate the distal residual mask and the normal ACL mask, thereby achieving ACL tear classification. Since the edge information of ACL is important in tear classification, we built the decoupled GAN by decoupling the body and edge parts of masks with different supervision and improved its segmentation performance through a histogram equalization for enhancing image quality, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module and a distribution module for improving feature representations as well as an effective channel attention mechanism. The experiments showed that the decoupled GAN model achieved promising results in the test set and demonstrated its feasibility in ACL segmentation. The proposed scheme also achieved good results in ACL tear quantification (accuracy: 0.929) and yielded a comparable performance with a senior orthopedic surgeon. This work can provide valuable diagnosis evidence of ACL tear for orthopedic surgeons and is expected to apply in clinical practice.

AB The research on state estimation for quadruped robots is critical. Its result passed to motion controller makes the robot navigate autonomously and adjust the gait to a more stable motion. The current research depends on a multi-sensor fusion of cameras, lidars or other proprioceptive sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and encoders. The high-frequency data are generally derived from body sensors, which is to be fused with data from external sensors directly, or preprocessed with EKF first. Due to its unguaranteed convergence and robustness of tracking state mutations, EKF is insufficient. Therefore, we study state estimation for hydraulic quadruped robot based on the fusion of IMU measurement and leg odometry in this paper, and Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) is successfully applied to quadruped robots by using this method. Besides, neural networks are utilized to train the weight functions of foot force and the state of leg odometry, and our trained functions improve the accuracy of observation compared with common weight average methods. Finally, our experiments of accuracy show that the root mean square error of our method is significantly reduced and the absolute trajectory error is reduced by 30% compared to traditional IEKF. The algorithm achieves the drift per distance travelled below 4 cm/m. Moreover, it has good robustness.

AB Log anomaly is a manifestation of a software system error or security threat. Detecting such unusual behaviours across logs in real-time is the driving force behind large-scale autonomous monitoring technology that can rapidly alert zero-day attacks. Increasingly, AI methods are being used to process voluminous log datasets and reveal patterns of correlated anomaly. In this paper, we propose an enhanced approach to learning semantic-aware embeddings for logs called the Subword Encoder Neural network (SEN). Solving upon a key limitation of previous semantic log parsing works, the proposed work introduces the concept of learning word vectors from subword-level granularity using an attention encoder strategy. The learnt embeddings reflect the contextual/lexical relationships at the word level. As a result, the learnt word representations precisely capture new log messages previously not seen by the model. Furthermore, we develop a novel feature distillation algorithm termed Naive Bayes Feature Selector (NBFS) to extract useful log events. This probabilistic technique examines the occurrence pattern of events to only select the salient ones that can aid anomaly detection. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to associate affinity to log events based on the target task. Since the predictions can be traced to the log messages, the AI is inherently explainable too. The model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a fair margin. It achieves a 0.99 detection F1-score on the benchmarked BGL, HDFS and OpenStack log datasets.

AB Traffic volume propagating from upstream road link to downstream road link is the key parameter for designing intersection signal timing scheme. Recent works successfully used graph convolutional network (GCN) and specific time-series model to forecast traffic flow by capturing the spatial-temporal features. However, accurately predicting traffic propagation flow (tpf) is challenging, since the classical GCN model only considers the influence of adjacent road link. In complex urban road network, specific traffic propagation flow (tpf) is affected by various spatial features, such as adjacent tpf, which influences from tpf with same upstream link and tpf with same downstream link. Thus, we proposed a multi-graph learning-based model named TPP-GCN (traffic propagation prediction-graph convolutional network) in this paper to predict the traffic propagation flow in urban road network. The TPP-GCN model captures not only the temporal features but also multi-spatial features based on multi-layer convolution. We validated the model using real-world traffic flow data derived from taxi GPS data in Shenzhen, China. Finally, we compare and evaluate the proposed model with the existing models across several prediction scales.

AB Immersive learning environments in education provide a set of rich and diverse learning affordances (possibilities). Cognition in such environments can be considered as embodied, enacted, embedded, and extended (the 4Es of cognition). During such cognitive happenings, we assume and live as valid everything we experience. Yet in this enactive structural coupling between individuals and their experiential world, another phenomenon occurs. We become a behaviorally inseparable entity with the virtual/immersive world. We become entangled with that virtual/immersive world. Here we propose that, within the framework of the 4Es of cognition, a recognizable lived experience phenomena occurs when learners engage with virtual or immersive learning environments. That is, cognition becomes entangled in immersive environments with alternative realities. Coming from the Santiago school of cognition, and building from ideas from immersive learning, 4E cognition, and quantum entanglement inspired in quantum cognition, we attempt to describe the process of entangled cognition happening in immersive learning environments. We recognize at least two levels of entanglement from the same recursive phenomenology: one we call a local entanglement, related to perception and sense-making; and a second we call a global entanglement, connected to the process and phenomena of human consciousness and meaning-making, accessible when conceived as a whole. We see the benefits for such a theoretical framework to ultimately guide, justify, and encourage the emergence of an epistemology shift in educational technology towards design principles that account for entangled cognition in immersive learning (and beyond), and the associated possibilities offered by new immersive technologies in education.

TI Shift-invariant tri-linearity-A new model for resolving untargeted gas
   chromatography coupled mass spectrometry data
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS

DT Article; Early Access
ID PARAFAC2; ALGORITHM
AB Multi-way data analysis is popular in chemometrics for the decomposition of, for example, spectroscopic or chromatographic higher-order tensor datasets. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and its extension, PARAFAC2, are extensively employed methods in chemometrics. Applications of PARAFAC2 for untargeted data analysis of hyphenated gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) have proven to be very successful. This is attributable to the ability of PARAFAC2 to account for retention time shifts and shape changes in chromatographic elution profiles. Despite its usefulness, the most common implementations of PARAFAC2 are considered quite slow. Furthermore, it is difficult to apply constraints (e.g., non-negativity) to the shifted mode in PARAFAC2 models. Both aspects are addressed by a new shift-invariant tri-linearity (SIT) algorithm proposed in this paper. It is shown on simulated and real GC-MS data that the SIT algorithm is 20-60 times faster than the latest PARAFAC2-alternating least squares (ALS) implementation and the PARAFAC2-flexible coupling algorithm. Further, the SIT method allows the implementation of constraints in all modes. Trials on real-world data indicate that the SIT algorithm compares well with alternatives. The new SIT method achieves better factor resolution than the benchmark in some cases and tends to need fewer latent variables to extract the same chemical information. Although SIT is not capable of modeling shape changes in elution profiles, trials on real-world data indicate the great robustness of the method even in those cases.

AB Multi-modal medical image fusion (MMIF) is used to merge multiple modes of medical images for better imaging quality and more comprehensive information, such that enhancing the reliability of clinical diagnosis. Since different types of medical images have different imaging mechanisms and focus on different pathological tissues, how to accurately fuse the information from various medical images has become an obstacle in image fusion research. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised subspace attentional framework for multi-modal image fusion, which is constructed by two sub-networks, i.e., the feature extract network and the feature fusion network. We implement a self-supervised strategy that facilitates the framework adaptively extracts the features of source images with the reconstruction of the fused image. Specifically, we adopt a subspace attentional Siamese Weighted Auto-Encoder as a feature extractor to extract the source image features including local and global features at first. Then, the extracted features are given into a weighted fusion decoding network to reconstruct the fused result, and the shallow features from the extractor are used to assist reconstruct the fused image. Finally, the feature extractor adaptively extracts the optimal features according to the fused results by simultaneously training the two sub-networks. Furthermore, to achieve better fusion results, we design a novel weight estimation in the weighted fidelity loss that measures the importance of each pixel by calculating a mixture of salient features and local contrast features of the image. Experiments demonstrate that our method gives the best results compared with other state-of-the-art fusion approaches.

ID COMPUTER VISION; ROBUST; ALGORITHMS
AB Sparse representation is an effective data classification algorithm that depends on the known training samples to categorise the test sample. It has been widely used in various image classification tasks. Sparseness in sparse representation means that only a few of instances selected from all training samples can effectively convey the essential class-specific information of the test sample, which is very important for classification. For deformable images such as human faces, pixels at the same location of different images of the same subject usually have different intensities. Therefore, extracting features and correctly classifying such deformable objects is very hard. Moreover, the lighting, attitude and occlusion cause more difficulty. Considering the problems and challenges listed above, a novel image representation and classification algorithm is proposed. First, the authors' algorithm generates virtual samples by a non-linear variation method. This method can effectively extract the low-frequency information of space-domain features of the original image, which is very useful for representing deformable objects. The combination of the original and virtual samples is more beneficial to improve the classification performance and robustness of the algorithm. Thereby, the authors' algorithm calculates the expression coefficients of the original and virtual samples separately using the sparse representation principle and obtains the final score by a designed efficient score fusion scheme. The weighting coefficients in the score fusion scheme are set entirely automatically. Finally, the algorithm classifies the samples based on the final scores. The experimental results show that our method performs better classification than conventional sparse representation algorithms.

AB With continuous advancements in ancient-book digitization and preservation research, the problems with the stitching of ancient-book images have become increasingly prominent, as traditional feature-mapping-based methods cannot satisfactorily stitch non-overlapping images. To realize the accurate stitching of the left and right pages of ancient-book images, this paper proposes a method for ancient-book image stitching to meet the requirements of their digitization in back-wrapped binding and other binding forms. First, a dataset of the black text frames from ancient-book images was established and then used to train a VGG16-UNet network for the extraction of black text frames. Then, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm was used to fit the black text frames and filter outliers. Finally, a sliding matching algorithm based on the position information of black text frames was proposed for the rectification of misalignments. The results showed that the method achieved a satisfying stitching effect and had good robustness.

AB In recent years, meaningful visual image encryption schemes that the plain image is compressed and encrypted and then hidden into the carrier image have received increasing attention. This paper proposes a new meaningful visual image encryption scheme, which consists of three stages: compression (compression network)-encryption (2D-SLC hyperchaotic map)-hiding (matrix encoding). First, the advantages of deep learning are explored. It can compress the width, height, channel, and pixel values of the plain image simultaneously. Second, a new 2D-SLC hyperchaotic map is designed to ensure security. It has a larger chaotic space and better randomness. Finally, to obtain a high-quality cipher image, the secure secret image is hidden in the grey carrier image by matrix encoding. The scheme can compress and encrypt the grey or colour plain image and then hide it in a grey carrier image. In addition, the theoretical peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the cipher image and the carrier image is improved from 40.9292 to 42.1785 dB. The total running time is only about 0.35, 0.87 and 3.1 s for a 256 x 256, 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 grey or colour plain image, respectively.

AB Recently, image guided depth completion has been widely explored and obtained remarkable performance. However, most of the existing image guided depth completion methods often fuse multilevel features or multimodal features by performing simple element-wise addition or concatenation, hence hindering the fusion effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose a gated recurrent fusion UNet for more effective feature fusion. Specifically, a gated recurrent model is used to adaptively select and fuse useful information from multilevel features. Moreover, we introduce a dimension-wise attention based CSPN++ module to iteratively refine depth estimation, which incorporates dimension-wise attention to fully learn feature interdependencies to obtain a more accurate neighborhood affinity matrix for spatial propagation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative evaluations and visual qualities.

AB Competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) has been concerned in recent years due to its achievements in solving global optimization problems. However, the CSO algorithm still suffers from issues such as low solution precision and premature convergence since it only relies on the winners to guide the population evolution. To address this issue, an improved competitive swarm optimizer with super-particle-leading is proposed in this paper. First, the super particle obtained by the cumulative learning strategy is used to provide a promising evolution direction for the population. Next, the weight-based dynamic omnidirectional strategy is employed to enhance the population exploration ability. Finally, CEC2017 benchmark problems are used to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive with the contender algorithms due to its better balance between exploration and exploitation.

AB Recently, the global food supply chain has become increasingly complex, and its scalability has grown. From farm to fork, the performance of food-producing systems is influenced by significant changes in the environment, population and economy. These changes may cause an increase in food fraud and safety hazards and hence, harm human health. Adopting artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the food supply chain is one strategy to reduce these hazards. Although the use of AI has been rising in numerous industries, such as precision nutrition, self-driving cars, precision agriculture, precision medicine and food safety, much of what AI systems do is a black box due to its poor explainability. This study covers numerous use cases of food fraud risk prediction using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as LIME, SHAP and WIT. We aimed to interpret the predictions of a machine learning model with the aid of these technologies. The case study was performed on a food fraud dataset using adulteration/fraud notifications retrieved from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed system and economically motivated adulteration database. A deep learning model was built based on this dataset and XAI tools have been investigated on the proposed deep learning model. Both features and shortcomings of the current XAI tools in the food fraud area have been presented.

AB Rough sets (RSs) and vague sets (VSs) are fundamental uncertainty methodologies, and their integrated rough vague sets (RVSs) establish a robust platform for data analysis. For RVSs, double-approximate VSs exhibit the singleness and extreme, so improved models are worth constructing. Thus, linear-combined rough vague sets (LcRVSs) are proposed to perfect RVSs, and subsequent probabilistic-RSs (called LcRVSs-PRSs) are modeled by three-way decision (3WD); furthermore, relevant uncertainty measurement optimization is investigated. At first, LcRVSs are parametrically constructed by fusing and extending RVSs, and their integration algorithms and operation properties are discussed; the granulation-cognitive approximation from LcRVSs to VSs is optimally considered by three-way similarity measures, and thus the optimal parameter value is approximately solved by a discrete search algorithm. Furthermore, LcRVSs motivate the LcRVSs-PRSs model via 3WD, and related construction algorithms and operation properties are offered; for uncertainty measurement, the accuracy, roughness, and dependency are discussed, and their cognitive approximation and parametric optimization are revealed. Finally, the obtained results of models, properties, measures, and algorithms are thoroughly demonstrated by data examples and numerical experiments. By this study, LcRVSs systematically extend, balance, improve RVSs, and their 3WD model (i.e., LcRVSs-PRSs) facilitates roughness decision, so relevant uncertainty measurement and parameter optimization benefit cognitive learning.

TI BCDetNet: a deep learning architecture for building change detection

AB Change detection is becoming more and more popular technology for the analysis of remote sensing data and is very important for an accurate understanding of changes that are happening in the Earth's surface. Different Deep Learning methods proposed till now are mainly focused on simple networks which results in poor detection for small changed areas because they can not differentiate between the bi-temporal image's characteristics. To solve this problem, this article proposes a novel Building Change Detection Network (BCDetNet) for building object change detection and its analysis from bi-temporal high resolution satellite image. The proposed BCDetNet model can detect small change areas with the help of multiple feature extraction block. The proposed BCDetNet model executes building change detection using bi-temporal high resolution satellite images. The proposed BCDetNet model is trained on two publicly available datasets namely LEVIR and WHU change detection(CD) datasets. These datasets contain RGB images with dimensions of (1024 x 1024) and (512 x 512), respectively. The BCDetNet model can learn from scratch during training and performs better than the benchmark change detection models with fewer trainable parameters. The BCDetNet model gives Recall-94.06%, Precision-93.00%, Jaccard score-88.40%, Accuracy-98.73%, F1 score-93.52% and Kappa coefficient-87.05% on LEVIR CD dataset and Recall-89.51%, Precision -92.78%, Jaccard score - 84.38%, Accuracy-96.78%, F1 score-91.06% and Kappa coefficient - 82.12% on WHU CD dataset. This work is a step in the direction of achieving best results in building change detection from high resolution satellite images.

AB Gold has practical applications in jewellery, technology, investors and by central banks. This diversity of gold demand and self-balancing nature of the gold market underpin gold's robust qualities as an investment asset. Accurately forecasting gold price is conductive to protect and promote portfolio's performing. The extant studies, however, fail to capture the volatility in gold price from the perspective of analyzing and forecasting. In this study, a novel separation-ensemble method, which incorporates decomposition, separation, prediction and integration (DSPI) approaches, is proposed to analyze and predict the international gold price. In particular, the proposed DSPI method begins with extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) for retrieving the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which is used to generate the multi-channel mixed signals of the gold price. Next, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm is utilized to reconstruct the IMFs. Additionally, the recombination of IMFs is regarded as input of separation module and independent components (ICs) can be separated by the RLS-type independent component analysis (RLS-ICA). Especially, we compare the interactive relationship between the gold price and underlying meanings of the ICs. Finally, the proposed heterogeneous forecasting scheme based on induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) approach, in the sense that it assigns a diverse contribution to the forecasting results of the ICs predicted by the individual forecasting approaches, is utilized to achieve the forecasting result of the gold price. Experimental results on the gold price collected from World Gold Council confirm the effectiveness of the proposed DSPI approach, and the comparison results show that it is superior to the extant combination methods.

AB Documents are essential nowadays and present everywhere. In order to manage the vast amount of documents managed by companies, a first step consists in automatically determining the type of the document (its class). Even if automatic classification has been widely studied in the state of the art, the strongly imbalanced context and industrial constraints bring new challenges which were not studied till now: how to classify as many documents as possible with the highest precision, in an imbalanced context and with some classes missing during training? To this end, this paper proposes to study two different solutions to address these issues. The first is a multimodal neural network reinforced by an attention model and an adapted loss function that is able to classify a great variety of documents. The second is a combination method that uses a cascade of systems to offer a gradual solution for each issue. These two options provide good results as well in ideal context than in imbalanced context. This comparison outlines the limitations and the future challenges. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Fractal geometry has been widely applied in computer graphics to visually represent natural objects, which cannot be easily represented by Euclidean geometry. Other than visual representation, parametric fractal-like CAD models have been used in industry for the design and manufacture of products with self-similarity geometric features. However, contemporary CAD systems cannot construct CAD fractal models efficiently, as most CAD fractal models are still built manually by designers. The construction and modifications for such CAD fractal models are tedious and time-consuming.This paper aims to build and modify CAD fractal models more efficiently in CAD systems. A method for automatically modeling parametric fractal-like geometry objects in CAD systems is proposed. Feature-based modeling methods have been applied for realizing algorithm-based CAD fractal model generation. A new type of feature, called CAD fractal feature is proposed and implemented to bridge the gap between CAD and fractal geometry. The fractal-like CAD model is constructed iteratively with a dynamic generator for each iteration cycle. Design parameters are extracted as inputs for dynamic fractal generators, which allows users to define, parameterize, generate and edit a fractal design with variable parameters. The parameters of the fractal generator can also take different values for different model construction iterations, which makes the generated models not necessarily to be strictly fractal but can also be fractal-like. The iterative generation method (IGM) is proposed as a built-in method in a CAD fractal feature for modeling complex but self-similar geometric models in an objected-oriented approach with high efficiency and sufficient design flexibility. As a result, designers do not need advanced knowledge of fractal geometry to build and modify CAD models with self-similar features. An extruded Koch Snowflake CAD model with parametric geometric variants has been built as a case study for demonstration of the proposed modeling method.

AB In the field of virtual product development, product performance is evaluated at an early stage through metamodel-based optimization using simulation, reducing development time and cost, and improving product quality. However, it takes a lot of time to construct a simulation model. The model must go through calibration and validation process to reduce errors with actual systems. This study proposes a novel engineering design process that can perform virtual data-based generative optimization by adapting the design domain of existing systems to those of new systems without requiring many simulations. A domain-adaptive designable data augmentation (DADDA) algorithm is proposed using inverse generator-implemented data augmentation, domain adaptation, and design optimization techniques. The DADDA algorithm can quickly provide optimal design variables for new systems compared to the genetic algorithm-based approximate optimization. The proposed process was applied to electric vehicle design. Driving responses and design variables related to safety performance were selected, and a small amount of training data was obtained using Modelica-based electric vehicle. As a result, it was shown that DADDA could significantly reduce the time required to derive optimal design variables by approximately 53% compared with the existing method. In addition, it is possible to derive the optimal performance for a new electric vehicle, which is approximately 21% better than that of an existing vehicle.

AB In the soybean market, it is a common phenomenon that low-quality soybeans replace high-quality soybeans. At the same time, due to the influence of the natural growth environment, the quality of soybeans produced in different origins is different. An effective method for detecting the quality of soybeans should be proposed. In this work, a deep learning method is proposed to classify the gas information of soybeans from different origins, providing an effective detection method for the quality supervision of the soybean market. Firstly, a PEN3 electronic nose (e-nose) is used to collect the gas information of soybeans from five different origins. Secondly, a multi-kernels channel attention mechanism (MKCAM) is proposed to focus on the key features of deep gas information. Thirdly, this paper proposes a residual dense block-MKCAM (RDB-MKCAM) to avoid feature degradation, improving feature expression capability. The results show that compared with other gas information classification methods, RDB-MKCAM has achieved 97.80% accuracy, 97.86% precision, 96.82% recall, and 97.33% F1-score, obtaining the best classification performance. In conclusion, RDB-MKCAM combined with a gas sensor array effectively realizes the classification of soybean gas information from different origins and provides an effective detection method for the quality supervision of the soybean market.

AB Emotional intelligence means an ability to understand how others are feeling so that one can adjust according to others' emotional needs. Machines with emotional intelligence must understand human emotions as well also be informative about their emotional changes. Several researchers have tried to detect emotions from speech but little work is done in the area where machines could predict emotional changes. In the proposed work we have tried to analyze the spectrum of the glottal source to predict emotional changes. The glottal source spectrum is represented as a single-frequency filtering spectrogram. Single frequency spectrogram has high resolution in the time and frequency domain simultaneously. A single-frequency filtering spectrogram is fed to EfficientNetB7 to predict time-instant emotional changes. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets IEMOCAP and RAVDESS. The proposed method shows high accuracy in comparison to other state-of-the-art techniques used for emotion prediction.

AB Battery is the core component of new energy vehicles. The choice of proper battery supplier is crucial for new energy vehicle companies since it directly affects the market share and core competitiveness. Some criteria of battery suppliers cannot be evaluated in the short period and need to be continuously evaluated at different periods (or time). Decision makers (DMs) may present some hesitancy when giving their evaluations. Thus, this paper formulates the battery supplier selection as a type of time-series based multi-criteria large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) with intuitionistic fuzzy information. A novel method is proposed to effectively resolve the battery supplier selection. Firstly, considering the importance of different periods, the comprehensive time weights are determined by combining the exponential decay model and the maximal entropy ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator weights determining model. Secondly, DMs are divided into different clusters by using the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy Hamming distance-based fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm on each criterion. Combining the confidence levels of DMs and the corresponding clustering results, the DMs' weights with respect to each criterion are determined. Then, the comprehensive criteria weights are obtained by integrating the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy and the constructed multi-objective programming model. Thirdly, the individual consensus level and group consensus degree at each period are defined, respectively. Then, a new identification approach is proposed to identify DMs to be adjusted. Subsequently, a total adjustment minimization model is built to adjust these DMs' evaluation information. The optimal alternative is generated according to the collective global overall evaluations. Finally, a real example of batter supplier selection is demonstrated to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.

AB Over the past decade, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) has become the most commonly used tool for source apportionment of air pollutants with a large fraction of those studies using the implementation developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-PMF) and its very useful diagnostic tools. During the same period, more studies are utilizing monitoring tools that provide hourly or even higher time resolution data leading to large data sets (millions of data points). Because of the nature of the graphic user interface in EPA-PMF, it cannot handle data sets more than approximately half a million data points. Thus, alternative approaches are needed to permit these larger data sets to be analyzed and still be able to provide the diagnostic outputs that permit better interpretations of the results. We have developed a protocol to use the multilinear engine (ME-2) that is the solver used in EPA-PMF to make such analyses. Here we report how to use this approach and present results for a representative data set of particle size distributions obtained in Rochester, New York between 2008 and 2019.

Some characteristics and their related results of these notions are introduced. The notions of q-ROFS s-algebra and qROFSM are the extensions of crisp a-algebra and crisp measure, respectively. Also, a multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) method based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft sets (q-ROFSSs), mean proportional operator and newly proposed score function is proposed. Furthermore, an application of the proposed methodology toward a clean environment is given to handle uncertainties and vagueness.

AB In the power system, the economic dispatch (ED) problem is the key issue, while fossil fuels cause environmental pollution. The allocation of power generation is included in the actual economic load dispatch issue of power generation for reducing the operating cost. This creates the economic load dispatch issue, a large-scale, highly nonlinear controlled optimization issue. The major issue in the power systems is the loss, fuel cost, and emission. The existing algorithms can optimize the parameters mentioned above, but it is not much better. Hence, this paper presents the multi-objective multi-verse optimization (MOMVO) for the dynamic load dispatch problem. The dynamic load dispatch issue is evaluated by cost and emission evaluation with hybrid renewable energy Sources (RES). Here, the proposed algorithm generates the thermal, photovoltaic (PV) and wind power values, reducing the cost and emission values. The unit's power generation is the foremost aim of dynamic economic load dispatch (DELD) to meet the load demand while sustaining various operational constrictions; the generation's total cost is reduced. The MVO algorithm is applied to nonlinear DELD issues and is a reliable and robust optimization algorithm. The introduced scheme is implemented and tested over three test systems, such as 6, 10, and 11 generating units. The implementation is performed on the MATLAB R2016a platform, and the performance results are evaluated based on with and without valve-point loading (VPL). Finally, VPL produced better solutions than the without VPL case.

AB The growing use of technology and social media has resulted in the emergence of digital influencers, a new profession capable of changing the mentalities and behaviours of those who follow them. This study arises to better understand the potential impact digital influencers might have on the Portuguese population's purchase behaviour and patterns, and for this purpose, seven hypotheses were formulated. An online questionnaire was conducted to respond to these theoretical assumptions and collected data from 175 respondents. A total of 129 valid answers were considered. It was possible to conclude that purchase intention does not necessarily translate into a purchase action. It was also concluded that the relationship between social network use and the purchase of products/services recommended by influencers is only statistically significant for Instagram. Furthermore, the individuals' generation is not statistically significant / linked with purchasing a product/service recommended by influencers. Yet further, a small percentage of respondents have also identified themselves as impulsive shoppers and perceived Instagram as their favourite social network. With the results of this study, it is also possible to state that the influencer's opinion was classified as the last factor considered in the purchase decision process. Additionally, there is a weak negative association between purchasing a product/service recommended by influencers with sponsorship disclosure and remunerated partnership, which decreases credibility and discourages purchasing, in Portugal, a feminine culture which dislikes materialism.

AB Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is an essential branch of image fusion, and enhancing the visible image of IVIF can significantly improve the fusion performance. However, many existing low-light enhancement methods are unsuitable for the visible image enhancement of IVIF. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new visible image enhancement method for IVIF. Firstly, the colour balance and contrast enhancement-based self-calibrated illumination estimation (CCSCE) is proposed to improve the input image's brightness, contrast, and colour information. Then, the method based on Mutually Guided Image Filtering (muGIF) is adopted to design a strategy to extract details adaptively from the original visible image, which can keep details without introducing additional noise effectively. Finally, the proposed visible image enhancement technique is used for IVIF tasks. In addition, the proposed method can be used for the visible image enhancement of IVIF and other low-light images. Experiment results on different public datasets and IVIF demonstrate the authors' method's superiority from both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. The authors' code will be publicly available at .

DE Motivation; motivated behavior; enactivism; mental causation; life-mind
   continuity
AB In a recent remarkable article, Froese (2023) presents his Irruption Theory to explain how motivations can make a behavioral difference in motivated activity. In this opinion article, we review the main tenets of Froese's theory, and highlight its difficulty in overcoming the randomness challenge it supposedly solves, that is, the issue of how adaptive behavior can arise in the face of material underdetermination. To advance our understanding of motivated behavior in line with Froese's approach, we recommend that future work should endorse a multilevel pluralistic approach to causation and explanation in which motivations could genuinely play an irreducible role. Additionally, in line with the life-mind continuity thesis, we suggest that the best place to look for the interplay between motivations and nonmotivational physical, biological, and dynamical factors, may be at the level of the continuous feeling of being an embodied, living organism.

AB The brain is a complex organ of the body. Any abnormality in brain cells can affect the function of the human body. Brain space-occupying lesions include tumors, abscesses, and cysts. Brain MRI images are noisy that degrades the detection accuracy. Therefore, 32-layers-denoise neural network is proposed on the selected hyper-parameters to improve the image quality. To classify the healthy/abnormal MRI slices, a novel seven layers Javeria Quanvolutional Neural Network model is proposed named as J. Qnet, that consists of the four dense, two drop-out, and one flattened layers. To localize the classified images, the open exchange neural network (ONNX)-YOLOv2tiny model is proposed based on the selected layers that is trained on the optimal hyper-parameters. To segment the localized images more accurately, 34 layers of U-net model are proposed, which is trained from the scratch using selected hyperparameters. The proposed model is evaluated on locally acquired images and BRATS-2020 dataset providing an accuracy of 0.96 and 0.98, respectively. Overall, the proposed method performed better as compared to the existing research works that authenticate the novelty of this work.

   (Co-IoU) loss; Small object detection; Refining location; Depthwise
   separable dilated convolution
AB Object detection, an important task in computer vision, has achieved a conspicuous improvement. Among the methods for object detection, the one-stage detector is a simple, end-to-end, anchor-free, and straightforward deep learning pipeline. Many one-stage detectors locate the bounding box using regression, and the regression loss is the maximum among all errors. Hence, locating the bounding box accurately is one of the keys for improving the average precision (AP) for a detector. In this paper, we suggest a simple and precise locator named the bounding convolutional network (BoundConvNet) to draw "bounding features" from heatmaps to refine the object locations and apply a category-aware collaborative intersection over union (Co-IoU) loss function to optimize the bounding box regression for dealing with a problem of different class center point overlap. BoundConvNet is a head network for bounding box regression, which contains several depthwise separable dilated convolutional layers to decouple the classification task from the regression task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BoundConvNet improves the AP of the one-stage detector CenterNet and helps the CenterNet mark the bounding box of objects more accurately. For small object detection, the AP of CenterNet is improved by 13.8% relative on MS COCO dataset with ResNet-18 as backbone.

AB Emotion recognition from facial image expression is always a problem for computer vision algorithms in classifying the human facial emotions. On other hand, over fitting is considered as a fundamental problem that prevents the deep learning model to fit the observed data on training data and unseen data on the test data. In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) based emotion recognition from facial images. Initially the study uses proper background removal tool to remove the image background and secondly, we use CNN to classify the facial features based mainly on the extraction of facial feature vector. The CNN is trained with huge number of facial features from the input images causes over fitting. This is mainly due to noise presence, limited training data size and classifier complexity and to avoid this, the study uses krill herd optimisation (KHO) that enables the fitting of the classifier. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model with expressional vector that recognizes the five types of facial features. The database consists of 20,000 images collected from 300 persons and the study obtains an accuracy of 98.6% during training and 98.45% during testing. The comparative analysis between various other deep learning models show that the proposed CNN-KHO has higher rate of accuracy than other methods.

AB We theorize that anticipatory thinking (AT) uses the same computational infrastructure as general cognition as described in the Common Model of Cognition. We extend the Common Model with results from research on event cognition. Using these building blocks, we present a five-step process model of AT as realized in cognitive architecture components. We then revisit simplifying assumptions underlying our model and expand our theory in response. Finally, we make predictions that are entailed by our account of AT, focusing on how computational limits in both natural and artificial cognitive systems can impact support for AT.

AB A rich literature explores how cutting parameters influence surface roughness in machining different materials using two-or three-dimensional visualisations. Research on Ti-6Al-4V alloy, an important but difficult-to -machine material, is relatively nascent. This research conducts real-life turning operations for Ti-6Al-4V alloy using coated and uncoated carbide inserts with different nose radii and subsequently applies ML techniques to simulate and characterise surface roughness (Ra) for varying cutting parameters - cutting speed (v), feed rate (f), depth of cut (d). Additionally, it presents an innovative visualisation of all three machining parameters' influences on the surface roughness for Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The results identify Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel as a highly potential ML approach to characterise the impact compared to SVM with linear kernel, Random Forest, Deep Learning, and ensemble approaches. The results also demonstrate, for a low feed rate and cutting speed, the surface roughness is better irrespective of the depth of cut and cutting tool materials. For coated carbide with a 0.40 mm nose radius and feed rate of 0.10 mm/rev, for example, Ra values stay within the range of 0.68 to 1.16 m ������ for all experimented cutting speeds ranging from 50 m/min to 250 m/min. A similar outcome occurs for other cutting tools. The surface roughness tends to be higher for a higher feed rate. However, the Ra values can decrease even for a high feed rate if the cutting speed exceeds 200 m/min. Overall, the visualisation indicates a nonlinear relationship between machining parameters and surface roughness.

AB The tooth flank collaborative optimization considering both geometric and loaded contact performances is an increasingly significant target in design and manufacturing for spiral bevel and hypoid gears. Recently, numerical loaded tooth contact analysis (NLTCA) is always an important access of mapping of the required performance evaluations and design variables. In addition to the conventional solution to NLTCA, an innovative discrete convolution and fast Fourier transformation (DC-FFT) method focusing on the micro-scale tooth flank topography is developed for high-performance spiral bevel and hypoid gears. Then, combining with accuracy and efficiency, a new top-rem tool modification is proposed to establish a new collaborative optimization model. Where, while the target flank can be prescribed by considering the user needs in the actual manufacturing, a small number of tool parameters are selected as the unknown design variables. It can significantly deal with the strong nonlinearity and coupling effect from the traditional modification and improve the optimization efficiency. Moreover, a top-rem tool modification is used as the optimization strategy to get a high optimization accuracy. The spiral bevel gear set from aerospace industrial applications is exercised to demonstrate the impact of the proposed collaborative optimization model on the tooth flank geometric and loaded contact performances.

AB Camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) based three-dimensional (3D) human pose estimation flourished in the last decade. However, existing methods are difficult to apply to clinical environments because of the many required devices. In this study, we attempt to reduce the devices and maintain their robustness. OccCorrector, a semantic convolution-based neural network, was proposed to estimate 3D human poses robustly in occlusion cases involving a single camera with the help of a few IMUs. It includes a simple Sensor-Reshape, which helps to fuse IMU information with the camera more effectively, and a new strategy of alternating the loss function, allowing the model to improve its accuracy in predicting challenging poses. By conducting an inverse analysis of the weight matrix, the importance of each IMU was investigated for device simplification purposes. The proposed method was verified by using the Total Capture dataset with two hypothetical occlusion conditions, and the result showed that only five IMUs can make the accuracy stable in different occlusion situations.

AB Fault diagnosis is of great importance for rotating machinery maintenance. Deep learning is an intelligent diagnosis technology that attracts more attention at present. The ability to learn fault features of pure CNN and RNN models is limited due to inherent structural defects. Therefore, we build a fault diagnosis model (WSAFormer-DFFN) combining CNN and self-attention structure to enhance learning ability. Meanwhile, propose 1D window-based multi-head self-attention (1D W-MSA) for vibration signal and its representation to introduce local inductive bias, which improves the robustness of the model. A series of experiments on three rotating machinery datasets show that the proposed model has better recognition accuracy and less performance attenuation in interference conditions. On the bearing dataset of Case Western Reserve University, the accuracy rate increases by 21.29%-37.12% compared with several classic models when the signal-to-noise ratio is -6 dB.

AB This paper investigates an observer-based state estimation issue for discrete-time semi-Markovian jump neural networks with Round-Robin protocol and cyber attacks. In order to avoid the network congestion and save the communication resources, the Round-Robin protocol is used to schedule the data transmissions over the networks. Specifically, the cyber attacks are modeled as a set of random variables satisfying the Bernoulli distribution. On the basis of the Lyapunov functional and the discrete Wirtinger-based inequality technique, some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the dissipativity performance and mean square exponential stability of the argument system. In order to compute the estimator gain parameters, a linear matrix inequality approach is utilized. Finally, two illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The diagnosis of faults in rotary vector (RV) reducers using machine data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models plays an important role, but it is difficult to obtain complete fault sample labeled data. Without labeled data, AI-based intelligent fault diagnosis models will fail. To solve the problem of data scarcity, a lumped parameter model of an RV reducer is developed to produce a sufficient training sample for AI models. First, a lumped parameter model of the healthy RV reducer is constructed and updated by the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) technique to obtain an agreeable dynamic model with a certain precision. Then, mathematical expressions of numerous fault modes with different fault severities are inserted into the model to calculate the fault samples. The simulated failure samples serve as training samples of AI-based intelligent models. Finally, CNN, VGG and ResNet are selected as the representatives of AI model, and then unknown fault samples are identified by applying data from real-time machinery. The experimental results suggest that the present method can be used to overcome the problem of insufficient fault samples in RV reducers.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB In this paper, the adaptive neural time-varying full-state constraints quantized consensus control is investigated for a class of nonlinear multiagent network systems with switching topologies. In most existing state constraints control schemes, the state constraints are achieved based on error constraints, and the feasibility conditions are required, which is a difficult problem for the application of controllers. Thus, based on the adaptive neural control method, this paper designs the integral Lyapunov functions to remove the restriction of the feasibility conditions completely. Therefore, the boundaries of state constraints control can be designed directly without feasibility conditions. Moreover, the boundaries of state constraints are considered as time-varying since there exist various factors affecting the boundaries, which is more suitable for practical multiagent systems. In multiagent network control, data transmission is a crucial element for system performance. For this problem, this paper designs the time-varying state constraints input quantization signals, which can reduce chattering and achieve low communication rates in the digital signal transmission for the multiagent systems under switching topologies communication networks. Then, the proposed strategy is validated in the simulation section. All the closed-loop signals are bounded under the proposed strategy.

ID REGRESSION
AB Image recognition and classification in the domain of cultural heritage is a complex task that usually requires good image quality and a large dataset. Small dataset is an apparent problem when data availability is limited, often resulting in poor classification performance. The aim of this study is to analyze and compare the performance of four machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, multilayer perceptron classifier, Naive Bayes, and decision tree, that are used to classify features extracted using eleven pre-trained deep learning architectures from a small set of images representing cultural heritage. The findings imply that random forest and multilayer perceptron classifiers are the most appropriate for the task of image classification of small cultural heritage datasets, as they obtained the highest performance compared to the other two algorithms, particularly when DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0 and NASNetMobile architectures are used for feature extraction. In addition, for the classification of features extracted using NASNetMobile all the four utilized machine learning algorithms obtained high accuracy ranging from 88.89 to 95.56%.

DE Knowledge graph; Embedding model; Community detection; Local importance
AB Knowledge graph completion can solve the common problems of missing and incomplete knowledge in the process of building knowledge graphs by predicting the missing entity and relationship information in the knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, existing knowledge graph completion algorithms seldom consider the influence of entity communities, and no algorithm further considers the influence of local importance based on entity communities. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding model and completion method based on entity feature information. First, we use the community detection method to divide the knowledge graph into different entity communities, and calculate the local importance of the entity in the community. Next, we apply community information to obtain entities and relationships with low similarities to construct more appropriate negative triples. A new hybrid objective function that can simultaneously reflect the importance of entities and the structure of the knowledge graph is proposed to obtain high-quality entity and relationship embedding vectors to complete the knowledge graph. On the FreeBase and WordNet datasets, through comparison with six well-known knowledge graph completion methods, the experimental results show that our proposed algorithm has good completion performance.

AB Bayesian networks play a vital role in human understanding of the world. Finding a precise equivalence class of a Bayesian network is an effective way to represent causality. However, as one of the most widely used methods of searching for equivalence classes, greedy equivalence search (GES), can easily fall into a local optimum. To address this problem, we explore the reasons why GES becomes stuck in a local optimum by analyzing its operators and search strategies in detail. Moreover, we demonstrate that converting the search space into another space can address the drawbacks of local search in the space of the equivalence class. Accordingly, two novel frameworks based on switching spaces are proposed to improve GES. Finally, the effectiveness, scalability, and stability of the proposed methods are verified by extensive experiments through which our frameworks are compared with state-of-the-art methods on different benchmarks. The results show that our methods significantly strengthen the performance of GES.

AB In the new era of information society, dynamic data is common and widely applied in many fields. To save the computing time of upper and lower approximations in rough methods, it is wise to study the incremental methods of calculating approximations and construct the incremental algorithms. In this study, we mainly focus on maintaining approximations dynamically in interval-valued ordered decision systems when the feature set and sample set increase or decrease, respectively. Firstly, the dominance relation on interval-valued ordered decision system are discussed. The two notions of interval dominance degree and interval overlap degree (denoted as IDD and IOD respectively) are introduced to describe the preference relation between interval values. Then, the incremental updating rules of approximations for four circumstances, namely adding attributes, removing attributes, adding objects, and removing objects, are obtained based on the matrix expression of approximations and dominated sets. Furthermore, the incremental algorithms are derived accordingly. By using six preprocessed data sets from UCI repository, a series of evaluations and comparisons are made on the calculation time of static algorithm and incremental algorithms. From these comparative experiments, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed dynamic algorithms could be verified.

However, there are two drawbacks when facing high-dimensional datasets: firstly, it is difficult to reduce features effectively, and secondly, the "curse of dimensionality". To alleviate those problems, we take the initial population generation as an entry point and propose a variant initial population generator, which can improve diversity and initialize populations randomly throughout the solution space. However, during the experimental process, it was found that the improved diversity would cause the algorithm to converge too fast and thus lead to premature. Therefore, we introduced multi-population techniques to balance diversity and convergence speed, and finally formed the MPF-FS framework. To prove the effectiveness of this framework, two feature selection algorithms, multi-population multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm and multi-population non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, are implemented based on this framework. Nine well-known public datasets were used in this study, and the results reveal that the two proposed multi-population methods on high-dimensional datasets can reduce more features without reducing (or even improving) classification accuracy, which outperforms the corresponding single-population algorithms. Further compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method still shows promising results.

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; SPREADERS
AB When solving the problem of influence maximization (IM) in social networks accompanied by diffusion cascades, existing related methods face some problems, such as relying only on diffusion cascades while ignoring network topology, inaccurate estimation of node influence, etc. To tackle these problems, a novel method named HGIM is proposed from the perspective of heterogeneous graph. HGIM is consisted of a learning node representation process and a selecting influential nodes process. A heterogeneous propagation graph is first constructed to integrate network topology and diffusion cascades, where topological edges come from the social network, and action edges come from diffusion cascades. Moreover, an influence learning framework is constructed to learn node representation and estimate node influence. To select influential nodes, two seed selection strategies are proposed based on the estimated node influence. To evaluate the proposed method, a series of experiments are carried out on four real datasets. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in solving the IM problem accompanied by diffusion cascades.

   Scene classification
AB Aerial scene classification using convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained substantial research interest during last few years. The performance of these deep models is found to improve more when the spatial relationships among the scene features are explicitly modelled using capsule network (CapsNet). However, the combined CNN and CapsNet-based scene classifiers are not only computationally intensive but also often suffer from over-parameterization, leading to remarkable performance deterioration under scarcity of labeled samples. In order to address this issue, we propose a lightweight as well as autonomous CapsNet model which auto-prunes the unnecessary weights/parameters during network learning/training phase, and eventually reduces the computational cost. The efficacy of our lightweight autonomous CapsNet is evaluated after embedding this into PReLim, a recently developed paradigm for remote sensing scene classification under observed sample limitation. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our proposed lightweight PReLim (LW-PReLim) is able to attain state-of-the-art accuracy even with 25% less CapsNet parameter count.

DE Context information; Dilated convolution; Multi-scale feature; Salient
   object detection
AB Multi-scale context features are conducive to image understanding, so it plays an important role in salient object detection (SOD) tasks, and contextual information-based SOD methods have achieved fine performance. However, the context information obtained through parallel independent convolutions with large kernels or dilated convolutions with different dilation rates is lack relevance and dependence at different scales, which limits the expressive ability of context information. In this article, we propose a novel Integrated Multi-Source Feature Network (IMSFNet) for accurate SOD task, which mainly consists of three components. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale feature aggregation module (MSFAM) to adequately capture and utilize multi-scale context features through a series of well-designed dilated convolutions and short hierarchical connections, and then aggregate these information to improve the performance of input initial features. Subsequently, based on the extracted high-level features, we introduce a global feature extractor (GFE) to further excavate higher-level global semantic information to help locate salient objects from cluttered real-world scenes. Finally, a correlation feature interaction module (CFIM) is designed to interact the diverse information from different level features, reducing the interference of complex backgrounds and highlighting salient objects. Extensive experimental results on six public SOD benchmark datasets convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IMSFNet method against the 18 state-of-the-art SOD methods under different evaluation metrics.

AB Stock markets are the result of the interaction of multiple participants, and market makers are one of them. Their main goal is to provide liquidity and market depth to the stock market by streaming bids and offers at both sides of the order book, at different price levels. This activity allows the rest of the participants to have more available prices to buy or sell stocks. In the last years, reinforcement learning market maker agents have been able to be profitable. But profit is not the only measure to evaluate the quality of a market maker. Inventory management arises as a risk source that must be under control. In this paper, we focus on inventory risk management designing an adaptive reward function able to control inventory depending on designer preferences. To achieve this, we introduce two control coefficients, AIIF (Alpha Inventory Impact Factor) and DITF (Dynamic Inventory Threshold Factor), which modulate dynamically the behavior of the market maker agent according to its evolving liquidity with good results. In addition, we analyze the impact of these factors in the trading operative, detailing the underlying strategies performed by these intelligent agents in terms of operative, profitability and inventory management. Last, we present a comparison with other existing reward functions to illustrate the robustness of our approach.

AB For effectively solving dynamic matrix equation (DME) problems, a non-convex and bound-constrained zeroing neural network (NCBC-ZNN) model is designed to relax the convex constraint on the demand of activation function and achieve robustness against various noises. Moreover, rigorous mathematical analyses and proofs are presented under the circumstances of noise-free and noise-perturbed to theoretically investigate the global convergence and robustness of the proposed NCBC-ZNN model. In addition, simulative experiments are further provided to substantiate the superior performance of the proposed model in solving the DME problem compared with the existing state-of-the-art models. Finally, the proposed model combines the constrained energy minimization (CEM) algorithm to solve the hyperspectral image multi-target detection (HIMTD) problem. Compared with existing schemes, our method is competitive in terms of accuracy.

AB Self-expression-based deep subspace clustering, integrating traditional subspace clustering methods into deep learning paradigm to enhance the representative capacity, has become an important branch in unsupervised learning methods. However, most existing methods investigate to impose only sparse constraint on the coefficient matrix to sparsely and independently represent all data, yet omitting another essential global low-rank prior. Meanwhile, some non-linear geometric structures within data has not been well utilized for deep subspace clustering. To conquer these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep subspace clustering method, named Laplacian Regularized Deep Low-Rank Subspace Clustering Network (LDLRSC), in which the low-rank prior and non-linear geometric information in data are captured simultaneously. Specifically, LDLRSC utilizes the nonconvex surrogate instead of sparsity to describe the global low-rankness of the self-representation matrix. Moreover, two types of Laplacian constraints are exploited to mine the geometric structure of the data samples. Extensive experiments on the several widely-used datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed LDLRSC over existing state-of-the-arts.

TI Transformer-Based Context Condensation for Boosting Feature Pyramids in
   Object Detection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article
DE Object detection; Feature pyramid; Context modeling
AB Current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (FP) module for multi-level feature fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between features from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation to achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require heavy cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result, making them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that can help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the computational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of representations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a locally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation, where the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the latter extracts general contextual representations of the whole image scene as global context cues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to investigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and then refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and light-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can boost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is compatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection accuracy by up to 7.8% in terms of average precision and reduce their complexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve state-of-the-art performance more efficiently. Code will be released at https://github.com/zhechen/TCC.

AB A popular approach to estimate scene flow is to utilize point cloud data from various Lidar scans. However, there is little attention to learning 3D motion from camera images. Learning scene flow from a monocular camera remains a challenging task due to its ill-posedness as well as lack of annotated data. Self-supervised methods demonstrate learning scene flow estimation from unlabeled data, yet their accuracy lags behind (semi-)supervised methods. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised monocular scene flow method that substantially improves the accuracy over the previous approaches. Based on RAFT, a state-of-the-art optical flow model, we design a new decoder to iteratively update 3D motion fields and disparity maps simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced upsampling layer and a disparity initialization technique, which overall further improves accuracy up to 7.2%. Our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among all self-supervised monocular scene flow methods, improving accuracy by 34.2%. Our fine-tuned model outperforms the best previous semi-supervised method with 228 times faster runtime. Code will be publicly available to ensure reproducibility.

ID CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT
AB Pelvis fracture detection is vital for diagnosing patients and making treatment decisions for traumatic pelvis injuries. Computer-aided diagnostic approaches have recently become popular for assisting doctors in disease diagnosis, making their conclusions more trustworthy and error-free. Inspecting X-ray images with fractures needs a lot of time from experienced physicians. However, there is a lack of inexperienced radiologists in many hospitals to deal with these images. Therefore, this study presents an accurate computer-aided-diagnosing system based on deep learning for detecting pelvis fractures. In this research, we construct an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework for pelvis fracture classification. We used a dataset containing 876 X-ray images (472 pelvis fractures and 404 normal images) to train the model. The obtained results are 98.5%, 98.5%, 98.5%, and 98.5% for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision.

AB While the number of people suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI) has increased considerably in recent years, the multiple deficits of these patients makes designing the rehabilitation process a challenge for practitioners. They need to group similar patients, due to their features and/ or diseases in order to assign them to the same clinically significant group to facilitate the design of appropriate rehabilitation activities. The information used to group the patients depends on the type of patient as well as the possible groups to be formed. This work focuses on studying how grouping patients with TBI has been carried out so far by means of clustering algorithms. The main interest in grouping TBI patients is the need to address this heterogeneity to create clinical guidelines or rehabilitation activities for individual groups and detect the characteristic features of each group. This study's main aims are: (1) to determine the purposes of the clustering algorithms developed for TBI patients, (2) to identify the normally considered deficits, (3) to determine the most commonly used clustering algorithms, (4) to identify the types of features usually employed for TBI clustering, (5) to analyse the data pre-processing techniques applied, (5) to identify the parameters chosen when running a clustering algorithm for TBI patients, and (6) to determine the efficiency/effectiveness achieved by clustering algorithms.

TI Continuous prediction of a time intervals-related pattern's completion
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Time interval data; Time interval patterns; Continuous prediction
AB In many daily applications, such as meteorology or patient data, the starting and ending times of the events are stored in a database, resulting in time interval data. Discovering patterns from time interval data can reveal informative patterns, in which the time intervals are related by temporal relations, such as before or overlaps. When multiple temporal variables are sampled in a variety of forms, and frequencies, as well as irregular events that may or may not have a duration, time intervals patterns can be a powerful way to discover temporal knowledge, since these temporal variables can be transformed into a uniform format of time intervals. Predicting the completion of such patterns can be used when the pattern ends with an event of interest, such as the recovery of a patient, or an undesirable event, such as a medical complication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have been published on time intervals-related patterns (TIRPs), their discovery, and their use as features for classification. However, as far as we know, no study has investigated the prediction of the completion of a TIRP. The main challenge in performing such a completion prediction occurs when the time intervals are coinciding and not finished yet which introduces uncertainty in the evolving temporal relations, and thus on the TIRP's evolution process. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new structure to represent the TIRP's evolution process and calculate the TIRP's completion probabilities over time. We introduce two continuous prediction models (CPMs), segmented continuous prediction model (SCPM), and fully continuous prediction model (FCPM) to estimate the TIRP's completion probability. With the SCPM, the TIRP's completion probability changes only at the TIRP's time intervals' starting or ending point. The FCPM incorporates, in addition, the duration between the TIRP's time intervals' starting and ending time points. A rigorous evaluation of four real-life medical and non-medical datasets was performed. The FCPM outperformed the SCPM and the baseline models (random forest, artificial neural network, and recurrent neural network) for all datasets. However, there is a trade-off between the prediction performance and their earliness since the new TIRP's time intervals' starting and ending time points are revealed over time, which increases the CPM's prediction performance.

AB For multi-threshold segmentation of grayscale and color images, the computational complexity increases exponentially with the increase of the number of threshold levels. In this paper, we propose a new method to segment grayscale and color images with Kapur entropy as the objective function. The method introduces four strategies such as horizontal crossover and vertical crossover into the bald eagle search optimization algorithm, forming an advanced bald eagle search optimization algorithm (ABES). In the benchmark function comparison experiments at IEEE CEC 2017, ABES was compared with classical and novel algorithms, and the results proved to have stronger convergence speed, convergence accuracy, and stability than other algorithms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in multi-thresholding segmentation of grayscale and color images, it is applied to low-level and high-level image multi-thresholding experiments, and the experimental results show that ABES outperforms other algorithms in the evaluation of PSNR, MSSIM, and FSIM, and ABES is a high-quality image segmentation method.

AB Against the background of the current complex international geopolitical situation and more intense trade frictions, the volatility of financial assets has important research significance as a basis for risk analysis and option pricing. First, considering the characteristics of financial assets-such as "long dependence"-the pricing model can become complicated, making it difficult to calculate the implied volatility directly. Establishing the loss function between the trading data and modeled value, the implied volatility at different moments solved using the global optimal double annealing algorithm was found to differ from the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility and historical volatility. Second, the implied volatility considering people's future expectations of financial assets was predicted using the previously known implied volatility via deep learning methods. The empirical results showed that the implied volatilities predicted using the long short-term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) methods performed well for option pricing. Moreover, the fractal option-pricing models outperformed the traditional Black-Scholes (B-S) pricing model. Finally, based on the accumulated local effect (ALE) algorithm-which can quantify the impact analysis of different volatilities on pricing models-it was found that the predicted implied volatility using artificial intelligence algorithms was more relevant to the truth. A combination of traditional mathematical models and emerging intelligent algorithms are promoted in this study, providing a reference for investors and risk managers and contributing to the continued development of financial markets.

AB In this paper, a modified Pascoletti-Serafini scalarization approach, called MOP_MPS, is proposed to generate approximations of a Pareto front of bounded multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). The objective is obtaining some points with an almost even distribution overall Pareto front. This algorithm is applied to six test problems with convex, non-convex, connected, and dis-connected Pareto fronts, and its results are compared with results of some famous algorithms. The results emphasize that MOP_MPS is effective and competitive in comparing with the other considered algorithms. In addition, it is shown that an optimal solution of a multiplicative programming problem is a properly Pareto optimal solution of an MOP. By considering this relation between MOPs and multiplicative programming problems (MPPs), another algorithm based on MOP_MPS, called MPP_MPS, is suggested for approximately solving non-linear MPPs in which functions multiplied are continuous and bounded from below. The computational results on seven problems of convex MPPs demonstrate that the algorithm is much better than a cut and bound algorithm presented by Shao and Ehrgott in terms of CPU time.

ID INVERTED PENDULUM; DESIGN
AB Underactuated systems, such as the double inverted pendulum (DIP) on a cart, are widely used in various applications such as anthropomorphic robot design, assistive robotics, slosh modeling etc. However, the design of a control strategy for such systems is challenging due to their underactuated, nonlinear and unstable nature. This paper addresses the aforementioned challenges by introducing a linear-quadratic-regulator (LQR) controller assisted by the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) to stabilize the pendulums on the cart, while also allowing it to follow the desired movements and overcoming the unmodeled dynamics of the system. The GSA is used to improve the system performances while maintaining stability. The suitability of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental studies, including cases with additional weights on the bob and on the cart and external disturbances. The improvements in system performances are shown through a comparative study with the performances of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and quantum PSO-based LQR controllers. The findings corroborate the efficacy of the proposed method in stabilizing the underactuated double inverted pendulum system on a cart in the nominal operating conditions and situations with additional weights and external disturbances.

AB Rapid urbanization, population expansion, and technical improvements over the last 10 years have had a substantial effect on the increase in global power consumption. The reduction of negative ecological effects as well as the economical advantages of sustainable power sources promotes greater incorporation of dispersed power sources into traditional electrical networks. DERs as well as the formation of crucial customer/prosumer-centered interconnected power systems seem to be two reasons why microgrids will getting more and more prevalent. This becomes a difficult challenge to manage the power revolution in this context and to integrate, coordinate, and govern different DERs. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) technology appears to be a potential way to improve microgrid management and performance in upcoming smart energy systems. The ANNC-based AI management solution employed for multiple-microgrid system in this study is called as feedback linearization management. Evaluation shows that this method produces greater authority as well as energy-saving effectiveness outcomes, which have increased by 10.89%. Additionally, the suggested microgrid fuzzy-dependent power managing scheme gets seen as an economical dispatching issue, and modeling outcomes demonstrate improved controls as well as a 10.79% reduction in power use.

DE Aspect category sentiment analysis; Self-attention; Natural language
   processing; Fusion mechanism; Text analysis
AB Aspect category-based sentiment analysis (ACSA) is a fine-grained sentiment analysis approach for predicting the sentiment polarity associated with the different aspect categories in a text. While numerous strategies have incorporated attention mechanisms to generate contextual features for specific aspectual objectives, their sole use may be influenced by the sentiments conveyed in other aspect categories. This can occur when aspectual targets are absent from the sentence and when words carry varying contextual sentiments across multiple aspect categories. This paper introduces the attention-based multi-level feature aggregation (AMFA) network, which simultaneously considers local and global information by applying attention to convolutional filters. It further employs context-guided self-attention modules at multiple levels to efficiently amalgamate learned different aspects and the interactions between contextual features within a cohesive framework. We tested the proposed approach on four public datasets. The results demonstrated the efficiency of our model in extracting more precise semantics and sentiments related to specific feature categories. To examine the practicality of AMFA, we constructed an online review dataset of table grapes from an e-commerce platform, where our model outperformed the baseline models with an accuracy of 88% and a macro-averaged F-1 score of 73.23%. We also validated the effectiveness of each AMFA module by testing them separately on all datasets. Experimental results prove that our proposed model is adept at semantically separating aspect embeddings from words in sentences and minimizing the impact of irrelevant information. Additionally, the robustness of our model is substantiated by supplementary experiments conducted on a constructed Chinese dataset.

AB The subjectivity and inaccuracy of in-clinic Cognitive Health Assessments (CHA) have led many researchers to explore ways to automate the process to make it more objective and to facilitate the needs of the healthcare industry. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as the most promising approaches to automate the CHA process. In this paper, we explore the background of CHA and delve into the extensive research recently undertaken in this domain to provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art. In particular, a careful selection of significant works published in the literature is reviewed to elaborate a range of enabling technologies and AI/ML techniques used for CHA, including conventional supervised and unsupervised machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and image processing techniques. Furthermore, we provide an overview of various means of data acquisition and the benchmark datasets. Finally, we discuss open issues and challenges in using AI and ML for CHA along with some possible solutions. In summary, this paper presents CHA tools, lists various data acquisition methods for CHA, provides technological advancements, presents the usage of AI for CHA, and open issues, challenges in the CHA domain. We hope this first-of-its-kind survey paper will significantly contribute to identifying research gaps in the complex and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary mental health field.

AB If episodic memory is constructive, experienced time is also a construct. We develop an event-based formalism that replaces the traditional objective, agent-independent notion of time with a constructive, agent-dependent notion of time. We show how to make this agent-dependent time entropic and hence well-defined. We use sheaf-theoretic techniques to render agent-dependent time functorial and to construct episodic memories as sequences of observed and constructed events with well-defined limits that maximise the consistency of categorisations assigned to objects appearing in memories. We then develop a condensed formalism that represents episodic memories as pure constructs from single events. We formulate an empirical hypothesis that human episodic memory implements a particular time-symmetric constructive functor, and discuss possible experimental tests.

AB Nowadays, real-time object detection, which is a crucial task, is being performed through image processing and deep learning techniques. As there are several high-performance computing edge devices available, selecting the best-fit device for a particular problem is a tough task and keeping in mind the cost, performance, and weight of the device in mind. One faces several challenges while performing this task in real-time such as a lack of resources in terms of power and mobility. We have provided an insight into the computation power of devices in terms of Frames per Second (FPS) by deploying object detection models on them. This paper will provide insight into selecting the appropriate combination of device and object detection models for real-time applications. Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3), Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi4), Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2), and Nvidia Jetson NANO are popular devices with high computation power used for real-time applications. The memory constraints of devices along with the deployment of different You Only Look Once (YOLO) and Single-Shot Detector (SSD) are the two object detection models that have been explained in this paper. A deep learning inference optimiser, TensorRT, has been used in NANO to achieve high throughput in the performance of object detection. The precision, recall, and F1 score achieved on deploying each tested model have been presented. After observing the devices during experimentation, RPi4+NCS2 showed the best execution with the blend of factors i.e. speed, portability, and user-friendliness.

ID TRACKING
AB Person image generation aims to synthesize realistic person images that follow the same distribution as the given dataset. Previous attempts can be generally categorized into two classes: conditional GAN and unconditional GAN. The former usually uses pose information as condition to make pose transfer using GAN. The generated person have the same identity as the source person. The latter generates person images from scratch, and the real person images are only used as references for the discriminator. While conditional GAN is widely studied, unconditional GAN is also worth exploring because it can synthesize person image with new identity, which is a useful manner of data augmentation. These two types of generating methods have their different advantages and disadvantages, and sometimes they are complementary. This paper proposes a CoGAN to cooperatively train two types of GANs in an end-to-end framework. The two GANs serve different purposes, and can learn from each other during the cooperative learning procedure. The experimental results on public datasets show that the proposed CoGAN improves the performance of both baseline methods, and achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods.

AB In the era of Industry 4.0, production scheduling as a critical part of manufacturing system should be smarter. Smart scheduling agent is required to be real-time autonomous and possess the ability to face unforeseen and disruptive events. However, traditional methods lack adaptability and intelligence. Hence, this paper is devoted to proposing a smart approach based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) to solve dynamic job shop scheduling problem with random job arrivals. The PPO scheduling agent is trained based on an integration framework of discrete event simulation and deep reinforcement learning. Copies of trained agent can be linked with each machine for distributed control. Meanwhile, state features, actions and rewards are designed for scheduling at each decision point. Reward scaling are applied to improve the convergence performance. The numerical experiments are conducted on cases with different production configurations. The results show that PPO method can realize on-line decision making and provide better solution than dispatch rules and heuristics. It can achieve a balance between time and quality. Moreover, the trained model could also maintain certain performance even in untrained scenarios.

AB Appropriately characterising the mixed space-time relations of the contagion process caused by hybrid space and time factors remains the primary challenge in COVID-19 forecasting. However, in previous deep learning models for epidemic forecasting, spatial and temporal variations are captured separately. A unified model is developed to cover all spatio-temporal relations. However, this measure is insufficient for modelling the complex spatio-temporal relations of infectious disease transmission. A dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph network (DASTGN) is proposed based on attention mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy. In DASTGN, complex spatio-temporal relations are depicted by adaptively fusing the mixed space-time effects and dynamic space-time dependency structure. This dual-scale model considers the time-specific, space-specific, and direct effects of the propagation process at the fine-grained level. Furthermore, the model characterises impacts from various space-time neighbour blocks under time-varying interventions at the coarse-grained level. The performance comparisons on the three COVID-19 datasets reveal that DASTGN achieves state-of-the-art results with a maximum improvement of 17.092% in the root mean-square error and 11.563% in the mean absolute error. Experimental results indicate that the mechanisms of designing DASTGN can effectively detect some spreading characteristics of COVID-19. The spatio-temporal weight matrices learned in each proposed module reveal diffusion patterns in various scenarios. In conclusion, DASTGN has successfully captured the dynamic spatio-temporal variations of COVID-19, and considering multiple dynamic space-time relationships is essential in epidemic forecasting.

DE computer vision; learning (artificial intelligence); object tracking
AB Most Siamese-based trackers use classification and regression to determine the target bounding box, which can be formulated as a linear matching process of the template and search region. However, this only takes into account the similarity of features while ignoring the semantic object information, resulting in some cases in which the regression box with the highest classification score is not accurate. To address the lack of semantic information, an object tracking approach based on an ensemble semantic-aware network and redetection (ESART) is proposed. Furthermore, a DarkNet53 network with transfer learning is used as our semantic-aware model to adapt the detection task for extracting semantic information. In addition, a semantic tag redetection method to re-evaluate the bounding box and overcome inaccurate scaling issues is proposed. Extensive experiments based on OTB2015, UAV123, UAV20L, and GOT-10k show that our tracker is superior to other state-of-the-art trackers. It is noteworthy that our semantic-aware ensemble method can be embedded into any tracker for classification and regression task.

AB Recognition and diagnosis of stroke from magnetic resonance Image (MRIs) are significant for medical procedures in therapeutic standards. The primary goal of this scheme is the discovery of stroke in tumour locale in brain tissues influenced image. The probability of stroke is categorized on brain tumour influenced images into mild, moderate, or serious cases. The mild and moderate phases of stroke are recognized as "Ahead of schedule" findings and serious cases are distinguished as "Advance" determination. The proposed Glioblastoma brain tumour recognition strategy used the Multifaceted Brain Tumour Image Segmentation test open-access dataset for evaluating the presentation. The brain images are classified utilizing the Deep Neural Networks classification algorithm as normal and abnormal images. The tumour region is segmented from the identified set of abnormal images using the normalized graph cut algorithm. The stroke likelihood is identified using the Deep Neural Networks by analysing the proximity of tumour section in brain matters. The proposed stroke analysis framework accurately groups 10 images as "Right on time" stroke probability images and accomplishes 90% order rate. The proposed stroke prediction framework effectively characterizes images as "Advance" stroke probability images and accomplishes 90% characterization rate.

AB Dust accumulation over time can be one of the main causes of uncertainty in the output of photovoltaic (PV) systems. In order to better understand these losses, this paper established a daily dust accumulation prediction model for PV panels based on the delay output echo state network (DESN). A pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO) algorithm with adaptive Cauchy (AC) mutation strategy was proposed, which can optimize the reservoir parameters (such as leakage rate, spectral radius, and input scaling) of DESN, shorten the solution time, and improve search speed. Based on typical meteorological and air quality data, as well as daily accumulated dust weight recorded from the experimental platform, model training and testing were carried out. According to the Pearson correlation coefficient, the relationship between the environment parameters (humidity, wind speed, wind direction, PM2.5, PM10, and rainfall) and the dust accumulation was obtained. The results show that the prediction accuracy of AC-PIO-DESN is better than other methods for meteorological and air quality data. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for humidity, irradiance, PM2.5 and PM10 were 4.0743%, 4.4958%, 10.6231% and 12.8402%, respectively. In addition, the proposed daily dust prediction model has good robustness for 10-day samples, with an average relative error ranging from 0.65% to 54%. This method can provide data support for grid scheduling and PV panel cleaning strategy of PV power plants.

AB Single-point incremental forming (SPIF) enables the forming of fix-clamped sheet metal by moving a relatively small geometrically simple tool along the trajectory, producing the desired shape of the final product. Excessive thinning of the sheet results in fracture, determining the limit of formability. This characteristic of the forming process can be improved by upgrading the basic SPIF process to two-step forming, whereby a more even distribution of the sheet thickness can be achieved by pre-bulging with a hemispherical punch. This study focused on analysing the SPIF process and a hybrid two-step forming consisting of sequential bulging and SPIF. The analysis focused on the output parameters of sheet metal thinning and maximum forming force components and was conducted with Abaqus simulation software. An innovative new approach for influence analysis of technological, material and geometrical input parameters and correlation analysis between the mentioned parameters was performed using the random forest (RF) method, which allows the determination of individual parameter influence by analysing tree-shaped models obtained through the training process. The analysis results show a significant influence of the workpiece wall angle and part depth on thinning and initial sheet thickness on values of the forming force components. The results also show a great correlation between the parameters of the bulging depth and the part depth after SPIF and the significant influence of the appropriate choice of the backing plate geometry for the target product geometry.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Accurate and reliable prediction of vehicle trajectory is one of the core functions for automated vehicles, and it is a keystone for high-quality local motion planning and decision-making. However, due to the complex intervehicle interaction and the diversity of maneuvering classes, predicting future trajectory accurately is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel regional attention network with data-driven modal representation for multi-modal trajectory prediction (RD-Net). In the encoding phase, we construct the intention-based regional attention mechanism to model complex inter-vehicle interaction more effectively. In the traffic scene, this mechanism can assign attention to different regions guided by the intention of the target vehicle and perform weighted aggregation of inter-vehicle interaction in different regions, which makes it possible to model non-local interaction at a larger range without introducing noise caused by unrelated surrounding vehicles. In the decoding phase, a data-driven method is proposed to learn the individualized future modal representation for each trajectory. This method comprehensively considers the commonality and individuality of the trajectory modes, which can guide the proposed model to predict multi-modal trajectory based on different lateral maneuver classes more accurately. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the average performance improvement of RD-Net is greater than 21.00%, with a maximum of 52.48%, compared with the existing state-ofart methods, which quantitatively illustrates the significant advantages of RD-Net. Additionally, various ablation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed network components.

AB Background and Objectives: Code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) have marked a milestone in the scientific literature due to their ability to achieve reliable, high-speed brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for communication and control. Generally, these expert systems rely on encoding each command with shifted versions of binary pseudorandom sequences, i.e., flashing black and white targets according to the shifted code. Despite the excellent results in terms of accuracy and selection time, these high-contrast stimuli cause eyestrain for some users. In this work, we propose the use of non-binary p-ary m-sequences, whose levels are encoded with different shades of gray, as a more pleasant alternative than traditional binary codes. The performance and visual fatigue of these p-ary m-sequences, as well as their ability to provide reliable c-VEP-based BCIs, are analyzed for the first time. Methods: Five different m-sequences were evaluated with 16 healthy participants, following the circular shifting paradigm: base 2 (63 bits), base 3 (80 bits), base 5 (124 bits), base 7 (48 bits), and base 11 (120 bits). Signal processing consisted of a 3-filter bank (1-60 Hz, 12-60 Hz and 30-60 Hz), followed by a canonical correlation analysis. Raster latency correction and artifact rejection approaches were also applied to compute command templates. For each m-sequence, users performed a 30-trial calibration stage, followed by an online spelling task of 32 trials. In addition, qualitative measures regarding visual fatigue and satisfaction were collected. Results: Users were able to achieve an average accuracy of over 98% for all p-ary m-sequences. The differences between m-sequences were not significant in terms of accuracy, but they were in terms of visual fatigue. The higher the base, the less eyestrain perceived by users for both presentation rates of 60 Hz and 120 Hz. All p-ary m-sequences were also significantly less annoying when displayed at 120 Hz compared to 60 Hz. Conclusion: Results suggest that all p-ary m-sequences are suitable for achieving high speed and high accuracy in c-VEP-based BCIs, reducing the visual fatigue as the base increases, without degrading system performance. It is concluded that the use of high presentation rates and non-binary m-sequences is a promising alternative to provide user-friendly c-VEP-based BCIs.

AB Although time series prediction is widely used to estimate the future state of complex systems in various industries, accurate, interpretable and generalizable methods are still limited when used to make long-term nonstationary predictions. To this end, this article proposes deep attention fuzzy cognitive maps (DAFCM), which is composed of spatiotemporal fuzzy cognitive maps (STFCM), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, temporal fuzzy cognitive maps (TFCM) and residual structures. First, an improved attention mechanism is used to build spatiotemporal fuzzy cognitive maps that capture the spatial correlation in pairs of nodes and the temporal correlation of respective nodes. Second, the node state updated through the STFCM is input to the LSTM to capture the long-term trend of these series, and the TFCM with improved time attention is applied for the nonstationary problem in the time series. Finally, we add the state values of previous nodes into the DAFCM and build residual structures through linear transformation to prevent gradient explosion and gradient disappearance in long-term backpropagation. By combining the interpretability of fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) and the high prediction accuracy of deep learning, the DAFCM can be used to accomplish tasks such as multivariate long-term nonstationary time series forecasting in multiple domains, and its efficiency is validated with 6 public datasets across 9 baselines. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The last few years have seen an increasing demand for high-capacity Internet services, and this need has intensified in the years 2020 and 2021. In 2020 and 2021, Internet usage grew by 50% in several European countries, mainly due to home office, video streaming, hybrid teaching, and others. High-capacity optical networks usually meet this growing demand for Internet services. Thus, investigations that can improve the quality of optical networks are highly relevant in the current context. One of the research problems in this area is related to the physical topology design (PTD) of optical networks, which is classified as NP-hard. Several studies on PTD consider the application of meta-heuristics that obtain suboptimal solutions in a time compatible with engineering applications. However, meta-heuristics and local search techniques have been combined in several other optimization problems, which is not typical for the PTD problem. This paper proposes a solution to the PTD problem that combines a known multipurpose optimization algorithm, the NSGA-III, with operators considering the domain-specific knowledge of the problem to provide superior-quality networks. According to our results, the new proposal presents quality up to 8% higher than previous proposals concerning the hypervolume metrics (HV), maintaining a similar computational cost.

AB Searching through large volumes of medical data to retrieve relevant information is a challenging yet crucial task for clinical care. However the primitive and most common approach to retrieval, involving text in the form of keywords, is severely limited when dealing with complex media formats. Content-based retrieval offers a way to overcome this limitation, by using rich media as the query itself. Surgical video-to-video retrieval in particular is a new and largely unexplored research problem with high clinical value, especially in the real-time case: using real-time video hashing, search can be achieved directly inside of the operating room. Indeed, the process of hashing converts large data entries into compact binary arrays or hashes, enabling large-scale search operations at a very fast rate. However, due to fluctuations over the course of a video, not all bits in a given hash are equally reliable. In this work, we propose a method capable of mitigating this uncertainty while maintaining a light computational footprint. We present superior retrieval results (3%-4% top 10 mean average precision) on a multi-task evaluation protocol for surgery, using cholecystectomy phases, bypass phases, and coming from an entirely new dataset introduced here, surgical events across six different surgery types. Success on this multi-task benchmark shows the generalizability of our approach for surgical video retrieval.

AB Background and objective: Currently, haemodialysis treatment is performed using an open-loop control approach, with initial settings of parameters such as ultrafiltration rate and dialyser composition being adapted to the current haemodynamic condition of each patient, although unexpected events may require additional adjustments to be made. Therefore, an artificial neural network-based approach has been presented to automatically control the ultrafiltration rate according to the specific patient conditions during the haemodialysis session, in order to regulate body weight loss, and the elimination of electrolytes and uremic toxins. Methods: This modelling task is performed using a mathematical model of fluid and solute exchange based on first principles, which is used to simulate the process of a haemodialysis session in a specific patient under SIMULINK in order to define the underlying dynamic equations. Alongside this, MATLAB neural network tools are used to adjust the settings of the automatic controller for different body weight loss regulation profiles and variable dialysate sodium conditions during haemodialysis treatment. Results: Computer simulation results show the adequate performance of the body weight loss neuroadaptive control system when submitted to different haemodialysis patterns, uremic toxins and sodium elimination evolution under changing dialysate sodium conditions. Conclusions: The proposed approach proves to be a valuable tool as a test bench for the assessment of alternate haemodialysis profiles aimed to improve the treatment of patients by preventing dialysis-induced haemodynamic complications. The adaptive nature of the model-based control approach here presented makes it possible to personalize the haemodialysis treatment to the specific needs of each patient.

AB Hand gesture recognition (HGR) plays a significant role in interpreting the meaning of sign language, human- computer interaction, and robot control. This paper proposes a real-time skeleton-based intelligent dynamic hand gesture recognition (SBI-DHGR) approach, which comprises three modules: Palm Centroid (PC), Data augmentation with the Tenet Effect, and Deep learning architecture. The palm Centroid (PC) module is introduced to identify the proposed palm center joint. Data augmentation with a tenet effect module is designed to improve the CNN model's generalizability. Further, a novel deep learning model is proposed for temporal 3D-HGR by exploiting the capabilities of a multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent network. The multi-channel CNN is introduced to learn the cardinal positions of hand joints by capturing the low, average, and high-level features. LSTM is embedded to learn the temporal characteristics of hand joints. The effectiveness of the SBI-DHGR framework is evaluated over five challenging datasets: SHREC-14, SHREC-28, DHG-14, DHG-28, and FPHA, by adopting person-dependent and person-independent validation setups.

AB Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education.

AB This research develops a multi-stage decision framework for a three-tier collection network for hazardous waste considering random release dates. Applying a cost-based clustering approach, the first stage decisions involve locating the transfer stations and allocating generation nodes to the chosen facilities. The corresponding results, along with a subjective risk-aversion concept and estimated release dates, are utilized to generate an a priori collection plan, which can be further revised once the actual release dates are realized. We performed sensitivity analyses on important model elements, including the subjective risk-aversion parameter and vehicle capacity for collection tours. Our findings indicate that depending on the subjective perspective of the collector, deviations from the original scheduled plan can be a positive or negative phenomenon. For an optimistic decision-maker, adaption to the realized deviations necessitates accepting additional total risk. On the other hand, a pessimistic decision-maker is more likely to benefit from deviations. The findings can provide relevant authorities with practical and realistic strategic and operational decisions.

AB Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are tiny noncoding ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules that involve various biological processes for cancer advancements. Classification of cancer is a crucial problem in microarray technology because of the huge number of miRNAs and a limited number of samples. Therefore, to improve the classification of cancer between benign and malignant samples, this paper presents a hybrid filter-wrapper method that uses the multi-filter ensemble (MFE) approach as a filter method used in selecting the top-ranked miRNAs. For the wrapper approach, three different algorithms based on simultaneous utilization of the grey wolf optimizer (GWO), evolutionary population dynamics (EPD), and two selection mechanisms, are presented to enhance the GWO algorithm performance. The first approach involves the application of the EPD mechanisms to the GWO to eliminate the worst solutions of GWO and repositions them toward alpha, beta, or delta wolves to improve exploitation. So also, the GWO needed to randomly reinitialize its poor solutions near to the search space, using the EPD for the enhancement of the exploration process. In the second and third approaches, the Roulette wheel selection (RWS) and tournament selection (TS) are applied to offer a chance for low fitness individuals to be selected during the search process that maintains the diversity of the selected solutions. The proposed GWO_EPD algorithms are applied for miRNAs selection, and obtained results demonstrate that the EPD can improve the search capability of GWO in terms of avoiding local optima, exploration, and convergence rate. Moreover, the results of GWO_EPD are compared with twelve miRNAs subset selection approaches using classification accuracy and the number of selected miRNAs.

AB In the era of Large Language Models, there is still potential for improvement in current Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in terms of verifiability and consistency. NLP classical approaches are computationally expensive due to their high-power consumption, computing power, and storage requirements. Another computationally efficient approach to NLP is categorical quantum mechanics, which combines grammatical structure and individual word meaning to deduce the sentence meaning. As both quantum theory and natural language use vector space to describe states which are more efficient on quantum hardware, QNLP models can achieve up to quadratic speedup over classical direct calculation methods. In recent years, there is significant progress in utilizing quantum features such as superposition and entanglement to represent linguistic meaning on quantum hardware. Earlier research work has already demonstrated QNLP's potential quantum advantage in terms of speeding up search, enhancing classification tasks' accuracy and providing an exponentially large quantum state space in which complex linguistic structures can be efficiently embedded. In this work, a QNLP model is used to determine if two sentences are related to the same topic or not. By comparing our QNLP model to a classical tensor network-based one, our model improved training accuracy by up to 45% and validation accuracy by 35%, respectively. The QNLP model convergence is also studied when varying: first, the problem size, second, parametrized quantum circuits used for model's training, and last, the backend quantum simulator noise model. The experimental results show that strongly entangled ansatz designs result in fastest model convergence.

AB Gravitational lensing is the relativistic effect generated by massive bodies, which bend the space-time surrounding them. It is a deeply investigated topic in astrophysics and allows validating theoretical relativistic results and studying faint astrophysical objects that would not be visible otherwise. In recent years, machine learning methods have been applied to support the analysis of the gravitational lensing phenomena by detecting lensing effects in datasets consisting of images associated with brightness variation time series. However, the state-of-the-art approaches either consider only images and neglect time-series data or achieve relatively low accuracy on the most difficult datasets. This paper introduces Deep-GraviLens, a novel multi-modal network that classifies spatio-temporal data belonging to one non-lensed system type and three lensed system types. It surpasses the current state-of-the-art accuracy results by approximate to 3% to approximate to 11%, depending on the considered data set. Such an improvement will enable the acceleration of the analysis of lensed objects in upcoming astrophysical surveys, which will exploit the petabytes of data collected, e.g., from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

AB The rapid development of distributed edge intelligence in the Internet of things (IoT) scenarios has resulted in massive edge devices continuously generating data, leading to great pressure on traditional centralized trustworthy processing security protection systems. With the continuous enhancement of edge device computing capabilities, it is now possible to achieve the goal of trusted decision while generating edge data. Therefore, research on intelligent trusted decision methods for data production is an urgent issue to be addressed. To tackle this problem, an edge intelligent trusted decision mechanism is designed. In our trusted decision mechanism, a unified mapping model based on multidimensional attributes of edge devices is first constructed. Based on the descriptive model, three important trusted decision components (TDCs) are included: static, dynamic, and comprehensive trusted decision component (TDC). In static TDC, unidirectional and bidirectional trusted decision functions of edge devices are defined, respectively. In dynamic TDC, dynamic direct and indirect recommendation trusted decision are included. The dynamic comprehensive trusted decision is calculated by effectively weighting them. In comprehensive TDC, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to adaptively adjust the weighting factors of static and dynamic TDC, and the comprehensive trusted decision is calculated. To verify the performance of our proposed trusted decision mechanism, three broad experiments are carried out. Static and dynamic TDCs are verified on randomly generated data sets, while comprehensive TDC is verified on a real data set. The simulation results show that our static and dynamic TDCs can timely and accurately detect malicious devices. Moreover, the comprehensive TDC based on the real data set performs well on different performance measurement indicators.

AB Based on forwards recursive input-output data clustering, a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is proposed to estimate nonuniformly sampled nonlinear systems. The relationship of linear and nonlinear systems is studied under nonuniform sampling, and a fuzzy model is constructed for the global system. Forwards recursive input-output data clustering based on k-means clustering is used to identify the fuzzy rule number and the antecedent parameters. Based on the membership function, the consequent parameters are identified by an RLS algorithm. A practical application verified the efficiency of the method.

AB Remaining useful life prediction is a critical step in prognostics and health management. Wiener process has been widely used in RUL prediction studies for degradation modelling. However, current wiener-based remaining life prediction methods usually include single degradation pattern, which limits the universality of the methods to cases with unclear degradation trends. To overcome this drawback, a novel remaining useful life prediction method considering multiple degradation patterns is developed in this paper. In the offline phase, the initial degradation parameters are estimated with an improved approximation algorithm combing least squares regression and maximum likelihood estimation. In the online phase, three degradation patterns are considered and the Bayesian inference and expectation maximization algorithm are applied to estimate the model param-eters based on the online monitored degradation values. The remaining useful life prediction of each pattern is obtained as probability density function according to the property of the wiener process. To evaluate the per-formance of each degradation pattern and to determine the optimal pattern in real time, a fitness evaluation algorithm integrating dynamic time warping and feature-similarity is developed. The simulation signals and experimental datasets of aero engines and cutting tools are introduced to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and some widely used prediction methods are also applied as comparison. The results of the proposed method show higher accuracy than state-of-the art methods, which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

AB The detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals is a challenging task because it requires careful review of multi-channel EEG recordings over a lengthy time interval. In general, EEG-based seizure detection is strongly dependent on the ability to select descriptive features that are also stable in the sense that they are not sensitive to changes in the training data. This study proposes and investigates a patient-independent seizure detection model that uses stable EEG-based features obtained by comparing multiple feature selection methods. The schemes considered can be divided into five categories, often referred to as similarity, information theoretic, sparse learning, statistical, and graph centrality feature selection methods. The stability of the features these schemes produce was evaluated by random forest classification, using the intersection, frequency, correlation, and similarity measures. In experiments with Temple University Hospital's Seizure database of EEG records of 341 patients, unsupervised graph centrality feature selection was the most effective method, with a correct classification rate of 91.5%.

AB Fitness functions of real-world optimization problems often need to be analyzed by expensive experiments or numerical simulations. Integrating these expensive simulations or experiments directly into optimization algorithms would result in substantial computational costs. Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have attracted massive attention recently due to their high efficiency and applicability in solving real world optimization problems. As the dimension of the optimization problem increases, the computational cost of constructing surrogates increases, and the surrogate model's prediction accuracy may be severely degraded. High-dimensional model representation (HDMR) is a promising technique to partition a high dimensional function into low-dimensional component functions. However, HDMR's hierarchical structure limits its applicability in online SAEAs. To address these problems, this paper develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm with hierarchical surrogate technique and adaptive infill strategy (SAEA-HAS). In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical surrogate technique, in which a composite surrogate model is constructed by the first-order HDMR model and an error value-based surrogate model, then, using the internal contrastive analysis method, a hierarchical surrogate model (HSM) combining the composite surrogate with the fitness value-based surrogate is established. In addition, an adaptive infill strategy is developed to balance the exploration and exploitation of the surrogate-assisted evolutionary search. Various test functions and an antenna optimization problem are employed to compare SAEA-HAS with several well-known SAEAs. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of SAEA-HAS.

AB Bayesian networks (BNs) can be used for probabilistic reasoning over discrete variables. Their extension to the continuous domain, however, remains an open research issue. In this work, we address the Bayesian inference problem for continuous variables when negative evidence is available. This situation is faced when, because of unreliable or imperfect sensors, some variables are observed to be at specific intervals. We propose two solutions to this issue. The first one, dubbed dynamic discrete BN (DD-BN), is simply an adaptation of the dynamic discretization method; the second, referred to as SICA, is based on spline functions and the independent component analysis (ICA) method. SICA can represent a wide range of general multivariate distributions and possesses some integration characteristics that facilitate the inference process. Empirical trials on public datasets and simulated data yielded promising results regarding inference time and accuracy. Indeed, SICA achieved the highest accuracy at the expense of increased inference time with increasing dimensions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB When the prevalence of positive samples in a whole population is low, the pooling of samples to detect them has been widely used for epidemic control. However, its usefulness for applying analytical screening procedures in food safety (microbiological or allergen control), fraud detection or environmental monitoring is also evident.The expected number of tests per individual sample that is necessary to identify all 'positives' is a measure of the efficiency of a sample pooling strategy. Reducing this figure is key to an effective use of available resources in environmental control and food safety. This reduction becomes critical when the availability of analytical tests is limited, as the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic showed.The outcome of the qualitative analytical test is binary. Therefore, the operation governing the outcome of the pooled samples is not an algebraic sum of the individual results but the logical operator ' & PROVES; ' ('or' in natural language). Consequently, the problem of using pooled samples to identify positive samples naturally leads to proposing a system of logical equations. Therefore, this work suggests a new strategy of sample pooling based on: i) A half-fraction of a Placket-Burman design to make the pooled samples and ii) The logical resolution, not numerical, to identify the positive samples from the outcomes of the analysis of the pooled samples.For a prevalence of 'positive' equal to 0.05 and 10 original samples to be pooled, the algorithm presented here results in an expected value per individual equal to 0.37, meaning a 63% reduction in the expected number of tests per individual sample.With sensitivities and specificities of the analytical test ranging from 0.90 to 0.99, the expected number of tests per individual ranges from 0.332 to 0.416, always higher than other pooled testing algorithms. In addition, the accuracy of the algorithm proposed is better or similar to that of other published algorithms, with an expected number of hits ranging from 99.16 to 99.90%.The procedure is applied to the detection of food samples contaminated with a pathogen (Listeria monocytogenes) and others contaminated with an allergen (Pistachio) by means of Polymerase Chain Reaction, PCR, test.

ID PROGRESSION
AB Voice disorders are one of the incipient symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The existing PD voice feature analysis methods generally reduce dimensionality by selecting features with high relevance and low redundancy, ignoring the complementarity between features. To fully explore the intrinsic connection between PD features, this paper proposes a local dynamic feature selection fusion method (LDFSF) for PD identification and symptom severity prediction. First, the maximal information coefficient is used to calculate the relevance between features and the target value, and removes low relevant features. Then, a dynamic feature selection strategy based on self-organizing map network clustering is designed. This strategy dynamically updates the feature subset in a forward manner, and combines the relevance, redundancy and complementarity for feature selection. Among them, self-organizing map network clustering reduces the computational cost by reducing the number of candidate features, and effectively improves the accuracy of the model. Finally, the selected features are fed into the appropriate classifier or regressor to achieve accurate PD identification and severity progress prediction. Experiments on public OPDD and PTDS datasets show that the classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of LDFSF method on OPDD are 98.20%, 92.00% and 99.50% respectively, and the mean absolute error of predicting PD severity (motor- and total-UPDRS) on PTDS are 1.62 and 1.99 respectively, which are better than the compared methods for the selection of five and eight features respectively, thus indicating that the proposed LDFSF method can be effectively used in PD voice diagnosis.

AB Due to the widespread global internet services, service providers and users face a primary problem defending their systems, specifically from a new category of attacks and breaches. Network Intrusion Detection system (NIDS) assesses the network packets and reports low-security violations to respective system administrators. In the case of large imbalance datasets with more non-relevant features, the accuracy in classifying ad predicting precise intrusions needs to be improved. Moreover, most state-of-art intrusion-detection models based on machine learning may face high false-positive rates, imbalanced data with low training performance, low accuracy in detection, and complexity in optimization of feature selection aiding classification for impersonation attacks. Hence to overcome those complications, the present study deliberates an efficient IDS Modified Wrapper-based Whale Sine-cosine algorithm (MWWSCA) with Weighted Extreme Gradient Boosting (XgBoost) Classifier. The proposed model hybridizes the modified wrapper Whale Optimization approach and Sine-Cosine algorithm feature selection method to pick out the most discriminative, associated, and approximate best optimal features, enhancing the quality of prediction, not to fall on towards optimal local solution. Moreover, it balances out the exploitation and exploration phase of the model. However, the algorithm's performance may decline on classifying the multi-attack and binary attacks accurately and may be prone to an imbalance in classes; thus, a Weighted XGBoost classifier with regularization of the loss function is implemented in binary and multi-classification. It utilizes the best optimal features, assign high weights to weak minor class features, and handles class imbalance issues. Overfitting of the model is tackled through regularization in the loss function during the stage of feature classification. The experimental outcomes and comparative assessment, in multi-class and binary attack classification from UNSW-NB15 and CICIDS datasets, explicated outperforming results with high accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score metrics.

AB Most of existing the dehazing methods have high computational complexity and poor dehazing quality. Therefore, a fast haze removal method based on the haze density classification prior is proposed. Haze density is reflected by the difference between maximum channel and minimum channel. Based on this, haze density prior (HDP) is proposed. The HDP can effectively distinction between mist image and dense haze image, and quickly estimate the atmospheric light veil. In addition, an optimized method for estimating atmospheric light using the mid-channel of haze image is proposed, which overcomes limitations of global atmospheric light. Our method can fast and efficiently recover clear image because there is no estimation of transmission map. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in haze removal, especially for dense haze images. Comparison of objective evaluation and running time shows that the proposed method is effective and real-time.

AB The paper recommender system has provided great convenience for people to obtain knowledge of what they are interested in. Existing recommendation works mainly rely on learning entities' feature representations (network embedding) from the Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) through meta-paths. Most of them suffer from the difficulty of designing and selecting meta-paths in HIN. Moreover, changes in papers' captive audiences and users' reading favor in the recent trends are always covered up by long-term trends. To this end, we introduce a multi-attention aware recommendation method, named MARec. Specifically, to efficiently design and select meta-paths, we propose an auxiliary node-driven HIN construction method and combine it with the graph attention network (GAT) to learn the entities' feature representations. To endow the recommendation results with timeliness, we design an attention-aware Bi-directional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and a compensation mechanism to incorporate the recent trend changes. Furthermore, to take advantage of the importance of different papers/users, we utilize an attention mechanism to capture their importance by adaptively fusing the interactive historical data of those paper/user entities. We use extensive experiments on three real-world datasets to show that our proposed MARec outperforms current representative baselines by 11.49%, 11.40%, and 13.37% on average on three main metrics.

AB Accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) modules is key to design, simulate and control photovoltaic power systems. Due to insufficient data in the photovoltaic cell data sheets, PV models are represented using nonlinear current-voltage (I -V) characteristic curve behaviors with a large number of unknown parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the parameters of the PV models accurately and reliably. Because of their nonlinear, multivariate and multimodal characteristics, most existing methods face the problem of falling into local optima and converging prematurely. To identify parameters of the PV models more accurately, a Sub-Population improved Grey Wolf Optimizer with Gaussian mutation and Le & PRIME;vy flight (SPGWO) is proposed in this work. In SPGWO, the population is equally divided into superior and inferior subpopulations based on the performance of individuals. These two subpopulations adopt different search strategies to update the position of individuals. The covariance matrix C of the superior subpopulation is used as a Gaussian mutation operator to guide the next generation by mutation perturbation of elite wolves & alpha;, & beta; and & delta;, which can effectively improve the local exploration ability of SPGWO. To prevent premature convergence of the algorithm due to individual similarity, Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is used to explore potential candidates in the inferior subpopulation to increase population diversity. Considering the local stagnation of the entire population, an improved Le & PRIME;vy flight (LF) strategy is introduced to facilitate the entire population stepping outside the local optimum. The proposed SPGWO is used to solve the parameter identification problem for five different PV models. Statistical results and analysis show that SPGWO has outstanding accuracy and reliability.

AB Multi-instance learning, a commonly used technique in artificial intelligence for analyzing slides, can be applied to diagnose thyroid cancer based on cytological smears. Since smears do not have mul-tidimensional histological features similar to histopathology, mining potential contextual information and diversity of features is crucial for better classification performance. In this paper, we propose a pyramid multi-loss vision transformer model called PyMLViT, a novel algorithm with two core modules to address these issues. Specifically, we design a pyramid token extraction module to acquire potential contextual information on smears. The pyramid token structure extracts multi-scale local features, and the vision transformer structure further obtains global information through the self -attention mechanism. Furthermore, we construct multi-loss fusion module based on the conventional multi-instance learning framework. With carefully designed bag and patch weight allocation strategies, we incorporate slide-level annotations as pseudo-labels for patches to participate in training, thus enhancing the diversity of supervised information. Extensive experimental results on the real-world dataset show that PyMLViT has a high performance and a competitive number of parameters compared to popular methods for diagnosing thyroid cancer in cytological smears.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB End product quality prediction is one of the key issues in smart manufacturing. Reliable evaluation and parameter optimization is needed to ensure their high-quality production outputs. This study develops a novel approach that integrates adaptive machine learning and nonlinear regression to accurately predict highly customized end product quality based on small sets of supply-chain data through digital transformation, especially for complex industrial machinery manufacturing. This study was conducted in collaboration with a major power transformer manufacturer and its supply chain partners. Using the supply chain's key component real dataset, the qualities of end products are predicted using the adaptive model trained and validated with reliable accuracy. The power transformer key component parameter, i.e., core (or iron) loss, is incorporated as an input dataset for prediction model training and testing. The novel model integrates autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) machine learning, called ARIMA-AdaBoost. Compared with the previous research, the experiment results have shown that the ARIMA-AdaBoost outperforms the simple AdaBoost and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-AdaBoost for transformer quality predictions. The ARIMAAdaBoost model outperforms the existing methodologies in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) in real-data verification. The proposed approach benefits the manufacturers in overall production costs for predicting complex, expensive, and highly customized industrial product qualities and is adaptable to various industrial sectors.

AB Generative adversarial networks heavily rely on large datasets and carefully chosen model parameters to avoid model overfitting or mode collapse. Cutout with patch-loss augmentation, a dataset augmentation designed for generative adversarial networks that applies cutout to both the discriminator and the generator with a patch-loss structure and a new loss function, is proposed as a solution to the issue. It can enhance the performance of generative adversarial networks on full datasets and promote better convergence and stability on limited datasets. Additionally, the tensor value clamp is proposed, accelerating training speed without compromising quality. The proposed method can be successfully used with various generative adversarial networks, according to experiments. The performance of generative adversarial networks trained with full data on CIFAR-10 is matched by our method with only 20% of the training data. Finally, combined with our approach, StyleGAN2-ADA's Frechet Inception Distance (FID) results on the CIFAR-10, LSUN-CAT, and FFHQ-256 datasets can be further enhanced.

AB Various unsupervised greedy selection methods have been proposed as computationally tractable approxima-tions to the NP-hard subset selection problem. These methods rely on sequentially selecting the variables that best improve performance with respect to a selection criterion. Theoretical results exist that provide performance bounds and enable 'lazy greedy' efficient implementations for selection criteria that satisfy a diminishing returns property known as submodularity. Recently, the authors introduced Forward Selection Component Analysis (FSCA) which uses variance explained as its selection criterion. While variance explained is not a submodular criterion, FSCA has been shown to be highly effective for applications such as measurement plan optimization. Motivated by the desire to achieve a more computationally efficient and scalable algorithm implementation, in this paper a 'lazy' implementation of FSCA (L-FSCA) is proposed, which, although not equivalent to FSCA due to the absence of submodularity, has the potential to yield comparable performance while being up to an order of magnitude faster to compute. The efficacy of L-FSCA is demonstrated by performing a systematic comparison with FSCA and five other unsupervised variable selection methods from the literature using simulated and real-world case studies. Experimental results confirm that L-FSCA yields almost identical performance to FSCA while reducing computation time by between 22% and 94% for the case studies considered.

AB Automatic segmentation of medical images is a necessary prerequisite for diagnosing related diseases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive method in clinical practice, but obtaining reliable labeled training data for deep learning models is time-consuming and challenging. In this study, we propose an adaptive feature aggregation-based multi-task learning for uncertainty-guided semi-supervised image segmentation, dubbed AFAM-Net. The framework leverages a reconstruction task to capture anatomical information from raw images and assist the segmentation task. Moreover, we propose an adaptive feature aggregation strategy that selectively transfers useful features while filtering out irrelevant information, considering the associations between the two tasks. To better utilize unlabeled data, we incorporate dual uncertainty-aware methods to improve the segmentation performance. We evaluate the proposed AFAM-Net on clinical liver, 3D heart, and Cine cardiac MRI datasets. According to the experimental results, our AFAM-Net significantly outperformed other state-of-theart semi-supervised medical image segmentation algorithms.

AB The real-world complex systems of transportation and insurance constantly produce massive data, and the number of variables used to capture these systems can sometimes be overwhelming. Predictive modelling of such high-dimensional data often comes with the increased complexity of models, leading to low model interpretability and performance. Therefore, balancing the model's interpretability and prediction accuracy is crucial. Keeping a balance between these two aspects significantly improves prediction reliability. This will ensure that complex systems' overall control and management can be statistically optimal. However, measuring variable importance to reduce the dimensionality of given problems may be challenging due to different data sources, methods employed, or both. This paper proposes a novel approach to variable selection based on a comprehensive variable importance measure. The proposed method formulates variable selection as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem and uses TOPSIS to solve it. It offers a systematic approach to selecting variables to construct more interpretable predictive models. Our contribution is a thorough investigation using simulations with known model characteristics and a rigorous test of the method's robustness by analysing different datasets with different noise scenarios. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply it to the variable selection problem for the national collision database. We identify the most significant variables that may significantly influence the prediction of fatal accident rates.

AB Recommender systems, in real-world circumstances, tend to limit user exposure to certain topics and to overexpose them to others to maximize performance. However, repeated exposure to biased content could lead to the so-called echo chamber phenomenon: especially in social network environments, people encounter only information that reflects their previous beliefs and opinions, reinforcing them. This phenomenon could have worrying consequences for society, including the spread of aggressive, unhealthy, or risky behaviors. Some persons can be more affected than others by echo-chambers. We define as sensitive the users whose behavior could be influenced by the over- or under-exposure to certain items due to the echo-chamber effect, and as influential the items that could influence the behavior of such users. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending influential items to sensitive users. We formalize the problem and propose three techniques that can be used to diversify the distributions of influential items in order to positively affect sensitive users' behavior. Recommendations that meet this diversity criterion could potentially avoid dangerous societal consequences and simultaneously promote healthier lifestyles. We tested the proposed techniques in a real-world dataset by considering two different case studies that involved potentially aggressive and potentially depressed users. All techniques have been proven to be effective and allow high performance to be maintained while diversifying recommendations. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Using anthropological theory, this paper examines human-android interactions (HAI) as an emerging aspect of android science. These interactions are described in terms of adaptive learning (which is largely subconscious). This article is based on the observations reported and supplementary data from two studies that took place in Japan with a teleoperated android robot called Telenoid in the socialization of school children and older adults. We argue that interacting with androids brings about a special context, an interval, and a space/time for reflection and imagination that was not there before. During the interaction something happens. There is adaptive learning and as a result, both children and older adults accepted Telenoid, and the children and older adults accepted each other. Using frames of play and ritual, we make sense and 'capture' moments of adaptive learning, and the feedback that elicits a social response from all study participants that results in self-efficacy and socialization. While "ritual" refers to the application of what has been learned and "play" means that there are no obvious consequences of what has been learned. This analysis illuminates new understanding about the uncanny valley, cultural robotics and the therapeutic potential of HAI. This has implications for the acceptance of androids in 'socialized roles' and gives us insight into the subconscious adaptive learning processes that must take place within humans to accept androids into our society. This approach aims to provides a clearer conceptual basis and vocabulary for further research of android and humanoid development.

AB Context-awareness is a pervasive computing enabling technology that allows context-aware applications to respond to multiple contexts such as activity, location, temperature, and so on. When many users attempt to access the same context-aware application, user conflicts may emerge. This issue is emphasized, and a conflict resolution approach is presented to address it. Although there are other conflict resolution approaches in the literature, the one presented here is unique in that it considers the users' special cases such as their sickness, examinations, and so on when resolving conflicts. The proposed approach is helpful when several users with different special cases try to access the same context-aware application. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach, a conflict manager is integrated with the UbiREAL simulated context-aware home environment. The integrated conflict manager resolves conflicts by taking users special cases into account and employing either automated, mediated, or hybrid conflict resolution approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates that users are satisfied with it and that it is critical and essential to employ users' special cases in detecting and resolving users conflicts.

AB The linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy (Lq-ROF) set (Lq-ROFS) is an important implement in the research area in modelling vague decision information by incorporating the advantages of q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets with linguistic variables. To effectively fuse the Lq-ROF information, this paper introduces a series of Lq-ROF power Heronian mean operators with their weighted variants based on Archimedean operations. The defined operators meet certain important characteristics such as they can provide generality and flexibility in the aggregation process, model uncertainty of decision-making with interrelated attributes, and the influence of unreasonable attribute values can also be reduced by them. A generalized distance measure and an entropy measure were defined for Lq-ROFSs, subsequently. Afterwards, a multi-attribute group decision-making approach under Lq-ROF context, where the information about decision-makers' and attribute weights might be known or unknown, is designed utilizing individual expressions of the proposed operators. The developed approach includes a TOPSIS-based algorithm and an entropy-based algorithm in order to compute the weight of decision makers' and attributes, respectively. Finally, the proposed method's feasibility is validated by solving a financial strategy making problem, and its superiority is demonstrated via some detailed comparisons.

ID MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON; ENSEMBLE; MULTISTEP
AB Modular neural networks have shown distinct advantages in many regimes due to the "modular design". However, how to design an effective decomposition algorithm for improving the prediction accuracy is still a challenge for time series prediction. In this article, a novel modular neural network model based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) technique and multi-view learning (MNN-EMDMVL) is introduced for time series prediction, which can simultaneously and effectively decompose time series and improve the prediction accuracy of time series. Most of modular neural networks divide time series based on sample space using clustering algorithm without considering its time characteristic, which has an undesirable effect on prediction accuracy. Therefore, the structure of the proposed model consists of two parts: (1) time series decomposition, which can decompose time series into several subseries. (2) network learning, which can further improve the prediction performance of model. Firstly, this paper employs EMD technique to decompose time series into several subseries based on the local characteristic time scale, which can help subnetworks to learn the decomposed subseries more easily. But some subseries with high frequency feature fluctuates greatly, and changes fleetly, which may restrict the performance of subnetworks. Therefore, a novel multi-view learning with winner-take-all strategy (MVWTAS) is proposed to further improve the prediction performance of subnetworks. In MVWTAS, one or more views (features) of subseries with high frequency are selected as the auxiliary tasks and simultaneously learned. Then, the "best model" can be obtained from the auxiliary and main tasks in each time period of the subseries using winner-take-all strategy, thereby improving the prediction accuracy of the subseries with high frequency. Finally, experimental investigations using two benchmark time series and two real-world time series show that compared with other modular neural networks and single modes, MNN-EMDMVL has the distinct advantage in the terms of prediction performance both by time series decomposition using EMD and the developed multi-view learning with winner-take-all strategy.

AB In recent years, there have been several sports-related injuries and even unexpected fatalities due to the rapid growth of China's sports industry and increasing fitness issues. The prevalence of sports injuries is rapidly rising because of the intense competition among athletes and the increased physical load caused by players' long-term training. The difficulty in the sports' world is the identification and evaluation of risk factors associated with athletes. To address these issues, this paper develops a cognitive evaluation model for risk assessment of injuries in sports using big data to understand and determine the likelihood of injuries. The model is used to prevent the issues faced by running athlete's injury and thereby lowers the risk of overall risk. This paper also analyzes the injury factors while running by establishing an estimation model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network and explains how to compare RBF neural networks and risk level evaluation using certain criteria. The estimation model helps to identify and judge the risk factors of athletes. It designs an algorithm for Gaussian distribution, which predicts the output of the model. It discusses how the error may be calculated, which measures the neural network model's overall performance in forecasting sports' injury outcomes using a particular dataset. Finally, it designs the RBF Neural Network Learning algorithm, which generates the leaned network parameters to evaluate the reliability of risk cognitive model for athletes based on big data. The Lagrange and Bayesian models are selected for comparison. The results indicate that this model has a higher evaluation effect and accuracy as compared to other models. For this purpose, the comparison is made using 25 athletes. The proposed model's evaluation time is the lowest in comparison to the existing approaches. After examining the impact of cognitive evaluation, it has been reflected that the proposed model can be utilized to assess the different injury types for different parts of athletes. The highest single injury degree is 38.76%, while the highest composite injury degree is 40.05%.

AB In this study, we present a clustering cost function that uses K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) to detect outliers. Here, the Dunn index was used to estimate the ideal number of clusters. The obtained number of clusters was subsequently utilised to cluster data using the PSO algorithm and our proposed cost function. The KNN method was used to determine the top n outliers in the datasets, and data pruning was performed to eliminate any potential inliers. Outlier detection average precision was measured using both the K-means and our proposed algorithm. It was discovered that our proposed technique consistently detects outliers across different types of datasets containing both extremely and marginally distinct outliers from inliers data points. We believe that our proposed algorithm could be a promising technique for the outlier detection problem, with applications in network intrusion, medical diagnosis, banking, cyber-security, optical communication, etc.

AB Diabetic retinopathy is one of the major eye problems caused by defects in the blood vessels that occur in retinal tissues. Uncontrolled blood sugar makes diabetic retinopathy. Majority of the diabetic patients are affected by Macula Edema problems which makes vision loss. Diabetic Macula Edema can be identified at its earlier stage by floaters, dark areas, and blur in the vision. Earlier stages of the DME can be treated and saved from vision loss. The flow or deposit of the blood make swelling in the macula and it makes a serious complication called DME. Ophthalmologists used various computer methods to diagnose fundus images to identify macular Edema and its stages, but the accuracy of the DME detection and classification using fundus images with traditional methods is less. This problem is considered as a major problem, and most medical and healthcare experts are trying to provide a better solution with high accuracy. This paper has aimed to develop a combination of the U-Net model with the Multi-Class Support Vector Machine for segmenting and classifying OCT images. The experimental results show that the proposed U-Net-MSVM provides high accuracy in terms of classification. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by comparing its result with earlier methods.

AB The application of soft computing techniques in tele-robotic surgery can offer various benefits such as enhancing the precision of robotic systems, reducing the impact of communication delays, and improving the safety and efficacy of surgical procedures. Fuzzy logic is used in this research to model the uncertain and imprecise nature of surgical data and to provide decision-making support for the surgical robot. Tele-robotic systems are being widely used for automated surgeries, medication, and diagnostics. As these technologies involve internet-connected devices, it is important to establish trust between them and implement access control methods to enhance security and usability. The proposed fuzzy-based approach improves energy efficiency and effectively assigns access rights while performing tele-robotic surgeries. Machine intelligence-based fuzzy logic is used to guide the robotic arm during surgery and to adjust the forces exerted by the robot based on the softness or hardness of the tissues being operated on. These systems also provide data security and low latency and secure communication solutions for the tele-robotics community. The proposed machine intelligence-based mechanism performs activities independently and intelligently to minimize the latency in response, to optimize the energy consumed during communication. To assign permissions based on the least privileges, the proposed fuzzy intelligence-based algorithm is developed, and its performance is evaluated in terms of denial of service, throughput, latency in response, and energy consumption. The simulated results reveal that the proposed FACM approach can achieve good throughput, minimize latency and optimize energy consumption during tele-robotic surgeries.

DE Source-free domain adaptation; Online domain adaptation
AB We address the source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) problem, where only the source model is available during adaptation to the target domain. We consider two settings: the offline setting where all target data can be visited multiple times (epochs) to arrive at a prediction for each target sample, and the online setting where the target data needs to be directly classified upon arrival. Inspired by diverse classifier based domain adaptation methods, in this paper we introduce a second classifier, but with another classifier head fixed. When adapting to the target domain, the additional classifier initialized from source classifier is expected to find misclassified features. Next, when updating the feature extractor, those features will be pushed towards the right side of the source decision boundary, thus achieving source-free domain adaptation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive results for offline SFDA on several benchmark datasets compared with existing DA and SFDA methods, and our method surpasses by a large margin other SFDA methods under online source-free domain adaptation setting.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Accurate and reliable discrimination of crop categories is a significant data source for agricultural moni-toring and food security evaluation research. The convolutional neural network (CNN) model is one of the most popular classifiers for crop discrimination based on polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data. However, it is better to avoid directly using large amounts of raw features that extracted from Pol-SAR data for CNN models because of the "dimension disaster" problem caused by multiple periods and various feature extraction schemes. Consequently, an extra feature compression model has to be incorpo-rated to mitigate the "dimension disaster" problem. However, ill coupling of the two models may result in degraded classification performance, thus the combination of two models has to be further optimized. In this paper, we propose a novel single tensor affine transformation network (TATN) for crop classifica-tion using multi-temporal PolSAR data, where the input sample of the network is a higher order tensor formed by raw features, and the hidden layers of the network adopt the tensor affine transformation rather than convolution to extract discriminative features for classification. Since the tensor affine trans-formation preserves the structural information of the original input tensor samples, the TATN is expected to achieve a higher crop classification accuracy. Moreover, the TATN holds less amount of parameters than most of deep learning models, which enables to avoid the extra feature compression procedure. The experimental results validate the merits of our model. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article proposes a virtual reality (VR) system for diagnosing and rehabilitating lower limb amputees. A virtual environment and an intelligent space are the basis of the proposed solution. The target audiences are physiotherapists and doctors, and the aim is to provide a VR-based system to allow visualization and analysis of gait parameters and conformity. The multi-camera system from the intelligent space acquires images from patients during gait. This way, it is possible to generate tridimensional information for the VR-based system. Among the provided functionalities, the user can explore the virtual environment and manage several features, such as gait reproduction and parameters displayed, using a head-mounted display and hand controllers. Besides, the system presents an automatic classifier that can assist physiotherapists and doctors in assessing abnormalities from conventional human gait. We evaluate the system through two quantitative experiments. The first one addresses the performance evaluation of the automatic classifier. The second analysis is through a Likert scale questionnaire submitted to a group of physiotherapists. In this case, the specialists evaluate the existing features of the proposed framework. The results from the questionnaire showed that the virtual environment is suitable for helping track patients' rehabilitation. Also, the neural network-based classifier results are promising, averaging higher than 91% for all evaluation metrics. Finally, a comparison with related works in the literature highlights the contributions of the proposed solution to the field.

ID DESIGN
AB The design of a simple and adaptive flight controller is a real challenge in aerial robotics. A simple flight controller often generates a poor flight tracking performance. Furthermore, adaptive algorithms might be costly in time and resources or deep learning based methods may cause instability problems, for instance in presence of disturbances. In this paper, we propose an event-based neural learning control strategy that combines the use of a standard cascaded flight controller enhanced by a deep neural network that learns the disturbances in order to improve the tracking performance. The strategy relies on two events: one allowing the improvement of tracking errors and the second to ensure closed-loop system stability. After a validation of the proposed strategy in a ROS/Gazebo simulation environment, its effectiveness is confirmed in real experiments in the presence of wind disturbance.

DT Article
DE Travel time uncertainty prediction; Deep uncertainty estimation; Public
   transport transfer synchronization; Connection protection
AB This paper presents two novel approaches for uncertainty estimation adapted and extended for the multi-link bus travel time problem. The uncertainty is modeled directly as part of recurrent artificial neural networks, but using two fundamentally different approaches: one based on Deep Quantile Regression and the other on Bayesian neural network. Both approaches use a recurrent neural network to predict multiple time steps into the future, but handle the time-dependent uncertainty estimation differently. We present a novel sampling technique in order to aggregate quantile estimates for link level travel time to yield the multi-link travel time distribution needed for a vehicle to travel from its current position to a specific downstream stop point or transfer site.To motivate the relevance of uncertainty-aware models in the domain, we focus on the connection protection application as a case study: An expert system to determine whether a bus driver should hold and wait for a connecting service, thus ensuring the connection, or break the connection and reduce its own delay. Our results show that the proposed quantile sampling method performs overall best for the 80%, 90% and 95% prediction intervals, both for a 15 min time horizon into the future (t + 1), but also for the 30 and 45 min time horizon (t + 2 and t+ 3), with a constant, but very small underestimation of the uncertainty interval (1-4 pp.). However, we also show, that the Bayesian model still can outperform the DQR for specific cases. Lastly, we demonstrate how a simple decision support system can take advantage of our uncertainty-aware travel time models to prioritize the difference in travel time uncertainty for bus holding at strategic points, thus reducing the introduced delay for the connection protection application.

   Function; Data Fusion; Drug Discovery
AB In drug discovery, drug-target interaction (DTI) plays a crucial role. Identifying DTI in a wet-lab experiment is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Using reliable computational methods to predict DTI mitigates the enormous costs and time of drug discovery. Deep learning-based methods for predicting DTI have recently gained more attention. In DTI, drug-related and target-related data come in various modalities, which leads researchers to utilize multimodal approaches. It is shown that a discriminative feature representation of the drug-target pair plays the main role in multimodal DTI prediction. To achieve this goal, we propose a new multimodal approach that utilizes triplet loss jointly with task prediction loss. The proposed approach is called TripletMultiDTI. The proposed approach has two main contributions: 1) a new architecture that fuses the multimodal knowledge to predict interaction affinity labels and 2) a new loss function based on the triplet loss to learn more discriminative representation. Triplet loss encourages clustering of feature space such that similar drug-target pairs have the same feature space and dissimilar drug-target pairs have different feature space. As a result of our experiments, we were able to improve prediction performance. To this end, the proposed approach is evaluated on three wellknown datasets and compared with state-of-the-art multimodal approaches. According to the obtained results, we can perform better than comparable approaches.

AB Real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPI) through online soft sensors plays a crucial role in modern industrial processes to improve product quality and ensure production safety. In this paper, an Adaptive Double Gaussian Bayesian Network (ADGBN) is proposed to efficiently perform online soft sensor tasks, which can be updated according to the actual working conditions. The ADGBN is based on the concept of model bias correction and consists of an offline prediction model and a calibration model. The calibration model enables incremental learning-based parameter updates using newly generated online data. To improve the operational efficiency of the online soft sensor model, a novel dynamic variable window (DVW) is proposed to monitor model performance and enable adaptive updates. A case study on the polyester fiber polymerization process verifies the effectiveness of the proposed ADGBN online soft sensor and demonstrates its superiority over existing methods.

AB Accurate forecasting of traffic flows remains a significant challenge owing to its complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Although existing methods capture some spatiotemporal dependencies and stack them in a channel dimension, long-range sequences, implicit patterns, hidden fine-grained features and multi-scaled spatiotemporal dependencies are often ignored, which makes it difficult to represent the spatiotemporal dependencies comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, a novel deep learning model named Graph Spatiotemporal Channel Unet (U-shaped network) is proposed to achieve accurate and reliable traffic flow forecasting. First, a new temporal encoder-decoder module with causal convolution and transposed convolution is proposed, which can efficiently alleviate the gradient explosion/vanishing in capturing long-range sequences during encoding and decoding. Secondly, a new channel self-attention mechanism is proposed, which can efficiently capture the implicit patterns and hidden fine-grained features between channels and enhance the representation ability of the spatiotemporal dependencies. Thirdly, a new U-shaped multi-scaled spatiotemporal graph convolutional network is proposed to effectively capture the multi-scaled spatiotemporal dependencies. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms baseline models and achieves accurate traffic flow forecasting.

ID UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION; NETWORKS
AB Physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) has recently received significant attention as a rapid version of physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The key characteristic is to fix input layer weights with random values and use Moore-Penrose generalized inverse for the output weights. The framework is effective, but it easily suffers from overfitting noisy data and lacks uncertainty quantification for the solution under noise scenarios. To this end, we develop a novel Bayesian physics-informed extreme learning machine (BPIELM) to solve both forward and inverse linear PDE problems with noisy data in a unified framework. In our framework, a prior probability distri-bution is introduced in the output layer for extreme learning machine with physic laws and the Bayesian method is used to estimate the posterior of parameters. Besides, for inverse PDE problems, problem parameters considered as new output weights are unified in a framework with forward PDE problems. Finally, we demonstrate BPIELM considering both forward problems, including Poisson, advection, and diffusion equations, as well as inverse problems, where unknown problem parameters are estimated.

AB Identifying, classifying, and analyzing arguments in legal discourse has been a prominent area of research since the inception of the argument mining field. How-ever, there has been a major discrepancy between the way natural language process -ing (NLP) researchers model and annotate arguments in court decisions and the way legal experts understand and analyze legal argumentation. While computational approaches typically simplify arguments into generic premises and claims, argu-ments in legal research usually exhibit a rich typology that is important for gain-ing insights into the particular case and applications of law in general. We address this problem and make several substantial contributions to move the field forward. First, we design a new annotation scheme for legal arguments in proceedings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that is deeply rooted in the theory and practice of legal argumentation research. Second, we compile and annotate a large corpus of 373 court decisions (2.3M tokens and 15k annotated argument spans). Finally, we train an argument mining model that outperforms state-of-the-art models in the legal NLP domain and provide a thorough expert-based evaluation. All data-sets and source codes are available under open lincenses at https://github.com/trust hlt/mining-legal-arguments.

AB In recent years, remote-sensing image super-resolution (RSISR) methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant progress. However, the limited receptive field of the convolutional kernel in CNNs hinders the network's ability to effectively capture long-range features in images, thus limiting further improvements in model performance. Additionally, the deployment of existing RSISR models to terminal devices is challenging due to their high computational complexity and large number of parameters. To address these issues, we propose a Context-Aware Lightweight Super-Resolution Network (CALSRN) for remote-sensing images. The proposed network primarily consists of Context-Aware Transformer Blocks (CATBs), which incorporate a Local Context Extraction Branch (LCEB) and a Global Context Extraction Branch (GCEB) to explore both local and global image features. Furthermore, a Dynamic Weight Generation Branch (DWGB) is designed to generate aggregation weights for global and local features, enabling dynamic adjustment of the aggregation process. Specifically, the GCEB employs a Swin Transformer-based structure to obtain global information, while the LCEB utilizes a CNN-based cross-attention mechanism to extract local information. Ultimately, global and local features are aggregated using the weights acquired from the DWGB, capturing the global and local dependencies of the image and enhancing the quality of super-resolution reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing high-quality images with fewer parameters and less computational complexity compared with existing methods.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) provides an economic approach which aims to enhance understanding the behavior of structures by continuously collecting data through multiple networked sensors attached to the structure. These data are then utilized to gain insight into the health of a structure and make timely and economic decisions about its maintenance. The generated SHM sensing data are non-stationary and exist in a correlated multi-way form which makes the batch/off-line learning and standard two-way matrix analysis unable to capture all of these correlations and relationships. In this sense, the online tensor data analysis has become an essential tool for capturing underlying structures in higher-order datasets stored in a tensor X. RI1x center dot center dot center dot xIN. The CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition has been extensively studied and applied to approximate X by N loading matrices A(1),..., A( N) where N represents the order of the tensor. We propose a novel algorithm, FP-CPD, to parallelize the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of a tensor X. (RN)-N-I1x center dot center dot center dot xI. Our approach is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm which allows us to parallelize the learning process, and it is very useful in online setting since it updates Xt+1 in one single step. Our SGD algorithm is augmented with Nesterov's accelerated gradient and perturbation methods to accelerate and guarantee convergence. The experimental results using laboratory-based and real-life structural datasets indicate fast convergence and good scalability.

AB Research in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) in the healthcare sector is in a developing stage and demands further research to get more in-depth insight. We present a comprehensive model to develop and prioritize CRM readiness factors in hospitals using fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP, which helps top managers allocate their limited resources to enhance the required infrastructure for a CRM system. After extracting proper readiness factors, multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are applied to assess CRM readiness. First, using the fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach (DEMATEL), the interdependent relations amongst criteria are designated. Second, the fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) is applied to weigh the sub-criteria. Top management support and structure are the most critical factors which play an essential role in the CRM readiness concept. The importance of top management's factor has been investigated in many previous works. The structure has been neglected in the previous studies; however, our results demonstrate that it should be considered a crucial factor. This study's findings can facilitate the CRM system's adoption process to be employed by decision-makers within hospitals to mitigate the failure rate of the CRM system's implementation, leading to providing plenty of advantages to the patient association and hospitals. The results of this paper can also have a contribution to the implementation of CRM and artificial intelligence (AI) as an innovative strategy in organizations, particularly hospitals.

AB Multilevel thresholding is one of the most commonly used methods in image segmentation. However, the exhaustive search methods are costly in determining optimal thresholds and the conventional remora optimization algorithm (ROA) is prone to the premature convergence. This paper presents a chimp-inspired remora optimization algorithm (HCROA) to search optimal threshold levels, and the cross-entropy is employed as the objective function. In HCROA, the particles' position are adjusted by the Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA) because of its good exploitation ability and sufficient diversity. With this change, HCROA achieves both the intra-group diversity intelligence and a suitable balance between exploration and exploitation. To validate its performance, a series of experiments are performed. First, we test the HCROA's segmentation accuracy by a set of natural gray-scale images with different thresholds. Second, HCROA is implemented for noisy image segmentation to evaluate its robustness. Several reference-based measurements including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), Feature Similarity (FSIM), Quality Index based on Local Variance (QILV), Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity Index (HPSI), Wilcoxon test, and CPU time have been considered for evaluating the proposed method. Additionally, eight well-known predecessors are injected for parallel comparison. The comparison results prove that the suggested method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, noise robustness, and efficiency.

   Safety-critical
AB Considering the growing prominence of production-level AI and the threat of adversarial attacks that can poison a machine learning model against a certain label, evade classification, or reveal sensitive data about the model and training data to an attacker, adversaries pose fundamental problems to machine learning systems. Furthermore, much research has focused on the inverse relationship between robustness and accuracy, raising problems for real-time and safety-critical systems particularly since they are governed by legal constraints in which software changes must be explainable and every change must be thoroughly tested. While many defenses have been proposed, they are often computationally expensive and tend to reduce model accuracy. We have therefore conducted a large survey of attacks and defenses and present a simple and practical framework for analyzing any machine-learning system from a safety-critical perspective using adversarial noise to find the upper bound of the failure rate. Using this method, we conclude that all tested configurations of the ResNet architecture fail to meet any reasonable definition of 'safety-critical' when tested on even small-scale benchmark data. We examine state of the art defenses and attacks against computer vision systems with a focus on safety-critical applications in autonomous driving, industrial control, and healthcare. By testing a combination of attacks and defenses, their efficacy, and their run-time requirements, we provide substantial empirical evidence that modern neural networks consistently fail to meet established safety-critical standards by a wide margin.

AB Recently clustering for datasets with different shapes, densities and noises has attracted more and more attention from scholars. However, most current clustering algorithms improve the clustering performance at the expense of the simplicity, and cannot balance well between the clustering quality and the operability for the users. To solve this problem, we propose a new algorithm called stratification clustering based on density, hierarchy and partition (SDHP) by effectively integrating the advantages of the density-based, hierarchical-based and partition-based clustering. First, a new parameter-free local density estimation strategy based on the bidirectional natural neighbor relationship named local density based on natural neighbor (NN-LD) is proposed to identify the core part of each sub-cluster. Then, a new stratification strategy based on the NN-LD Stratification-NN-LD (S-NN-LD) is proposed to divide the entire dataset into two layers, the core layer and the edge layer, to simplify the dataset structure and make the algorithm robust to noises. Next, the hierarchical-based single-linkage algorithm is adopted in the core layer to obtain the initial clustering result since it has advantages on clustering the datasets with various shapes and densities. Finally, to improve the clustering accuracy of samples in the edge layer, a combination of a new local inter-cluster distance measure based on the average of neighbor distances and the partitioning clustering is adopted to match these samples to the sub-clusters in the initial clustering result. The experiments on twenty datasets show that the SDHP has better clustering accuracy, and can be applied in practice well compared with four popular hierarchical clustering algorithms, four recent density-based clustering algorithms, and a state-of-the-art partitioning clustering algorithm. The source code can be downloaded from https:// github.com/qi111678/SDHP.

AB The finest resource for consumers to evaluate products is online product reviews, and finding such reviews that are accurate and helpful can be difficult. These reviews may sometimes be corrupted, biased, contradictory, or lacking in detail. This opens the door for customer-focused review analysis methods. A method called "Multi-Domain Keyword Extraction using Word Vectors" aims to streamline the customer experience by giving them reviews from several websites together with in-depth assessments of the evaluations. Using the specific model number of the product, inputs are continuously grabbed from different e-commerce websites. Aspects and key phrases in the reviews are properly identified using machine learning, and the average sentiment for each keyword is calculated using context-based sentiment analysis. To precisely discover the keywords in massive texts, word embedding data will be analyzed by machine learning techniques. A unique methodology developed to locate trustworthy reviews considers several criteria that determine what makes a review credible. The experiments on real-time data sets showed better results compared to the existing traditional models.

TI Tool wear prediction in milling CFRP with different fiber orientations

DE Tool wear; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Cutting force; Machine

ID SURFACE QUALITY; GEOMETRY; FORCE; MODEL
AB In the machining of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) components, tool wear grows rapidly due to the highly abrasive property of carbon fibers, resulting in unfavorable part quality such as delamination and fiber pullout. The tool wear progression, cutting forces, and their quantitative relationship are highly dependent on the fiber orientation. This paper predicts the tool wear progression based on cutting force signals in milling unidirectional (UD) CFRP with the fiber orientation effect. A deep learning model based on multi-channel 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is used, with the benefit of considering the unique force variation features due to the CFRP anisotropy. Milling experiments with the fiber orientations of 0 & DEG;, 45 & DEG;, 90 & DEG;, and 135 & DEG; under different feed rates and cutting speeds were performed. The multi-channel 1D CNN obtains the force signal features from individual univariate time series, and combines the time-series information from all channels as the final feature representation in the final layer of the network. The LSTM layer extracts the temporal and spatial characteristics of the dynamic force signals. Moving window and distribution analysis techniques are applied to the predicted tool wear results to reduce the effect of force signal disturbance caused by CFRP inhomogeneity. The model achieves the tool wear prediction with R-2 of 95.04% and MAE of 2.94 & mu;m. Moreover, benefiting from its high feature representation capacity, the proposed method shows higher prediction accuracy for different cutting conditions with more than 25% improvement compared to other commonly used data-driven methods, including 1DCNN, 2DCNN, LSTM, BPNN, and SVR.

ID DIVERGENCE
AB In the process of industrial production, products with different specifications (i.e., the difference in geometry, process conditions, and machine conditions, etc.) have different quality data distributions, which lead to a decrease in the accuracy of traditional data-driven quality prediction models that require the same quality data distribution. At the same time, due to economic cost factors, obtaining a large amount of accumulated data for different specifications is difficult, and the re-modeling data accumulation of multiple cross-specifications is insufficient. In order to solve the quality prediction problem of production with different data distributions and poor data accumulation, we use the deep transfer learning (DTL) method with unsupervised dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) to transfer the domain invariant features learned from labeled specification products (source domain) to other unlabeled new specification products (target domain). In order to improve the success rate of cross-domain quality prediction, the Wasserstein distance adapter is designed to match appropriate source domain samples and target domain samples to build multiple transfer tasks that are suitable for transfer. At the same time, the dynamic distribution adaptation and dynamic adversarial adaptation are combined to extract the domain invariant features to improve the adaptability of the prediction model for products with new specifications (e.g., size difference) and unlabeled and limited quality data. Finally, a comprehensive experiment is carried out using the actual production data of products with different specifications. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional non-transfer deep learning methods, the MAE, RMSE, and R-2 of the proposed DTL method are improved by 18.26%, 16.66%, and 22.48% respectively. Compared with other transfer methods, the MAE, RMSE, and R-2 of the DTL proposed in this paper are improved by 10.45%, 10.96%, and 9.72% respectively.

DT Article
AB AI is transforming the way we live and work, with the potential to improve our lives in many ways. However, there are risks associated with AI deployments including failures of model robustness and security, explainability and interpretability, bias and fairness, and privacy and ethics. While there are international efforts to define governance standards for responsible AI, these are currently only principles-based, leaving organizations uncertain as to how they can prepare for emerging regulations or evaluate their effectiveness. We propose the use of anticipatory thinking and a flexible model risk audit (MRA) framework to bridge this gap and enable organizations to take an advantage of the benefits of responsible AI. This approach enables organizations to characterize risk at the model level and to apply the anticipatory thinking employed by high reliability organizations to achieve responsible AI deployments.

AB Emotion identification from text data has recently gained focus of the research community. This has multiple utilities in an assortment of domains. Many times, the original text is written in a different language and the end-user translates it to her native language using online utilities. Therefore, this paper presents a framework to detect emotions on translated text data in four different languages. The source language is English, whereas the four target languages include Chinese, French, German, and Spanish. Computational intelligence (CI) techniques are applied to extract features, dimensionality reduction, and classification of data into five basic classes of emotions. Results show that when English text is translated to French, classification accuracy is higher than others, i.e., 99.04%. Whereas, when the same is translated to Chinese language, its detection rate is lowest among target languages. It is concluded that emotions remain preserved after translation to some extent. Framework consists of TFIDF features. PCA and Discriminant Analysis perform good to detect emotions from translated data.

AB The bird's eye view, multi-scale and dense classes in remote sensing images challenge the object detection of remote sensing images. It is not satisfactory to directly apply the object detection method designed for natural scene images to the object detection of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a detector with enhanced feature extraction ability to solve the above challenges, namely TWDFPN. TWDFPN has designed the structure of a two-way feature pyramid network (TWFPN) by combining feature maps with different generation directions and different spatial resolutions, which not only improves the utilization of the underlying feature information, but also strengthens the repeated utilization of the feature information of the backbone network, and ultimately improves the feature extraction ability of the network. Meanwhile, the dense-connected module is used in TWFPN to enhance the feature representation ability through limited additional computation cost, which extends the network and deepens the network. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, this paper carried out experiments on NWPUVHR-10 and RSOD public remote sensing datasets, and the average accuracy (mAP) of 92.98% and 96.16%, respectively, which achieves advanced performance.

AB For the purpose of object detection, numerous key points based methods have been suggested. To alleviate the imbalance problem that some objects may be missing when a single-center-point based network is used for object detection, we propose a brand-new multiple space based cascaded center point network (MSCCPNet) for object detection. Particularly, we first bulid a novel structure to alleviate the imbalance problem in detecting different scale objects by scanning more objects in different scale spaces. We then propose a cascaded center point structure to predict the category and confidence of the object by integrating the results of the two centers with the idea of choosing the high confidence and discarding the low confidence. Finally, we determine the object's location by predicting the center point deviation as well as the width and height of the object. Our MSCCPNet shows competitive accuracy when compared with many sample classical object detection algorithms on GeForce RTX 2080Ti, according to the results of experiments on PASCAL VOC datasets and COCO datasets.

ID NETWORK
AB Recent studies reveal the crucial role of local features in learning robust and discriminative representations for person re-identification (Re-ID). Existing approaches typically rely on external tasks, for example, semantic segmentation, or pose estimation, to locate identifiable parts of given images. However, they heuristically utilise the predictions from off-the-shelf models, which may be sub-optimal in terms of both local partition and computational efficiency. They also ignore the mutual information with other inputs, which weakens the representation capabilities of local features. In this study, the authors put forward a novel Attribute-guided Transformer (AiT), which explicitly exploits pedestrian attributes as semantic priors for discriminative representation learning. Specifically, the authors first introduce an attribute learning process, which generates a set of attention maps highlighting the informative parts of pedestrian images. Then, the authors design a Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) to iteratively inject attribute information into global feature maps, aiming at suppressing unnecessary noise and inferring attribute-aware representations. Last, the authors propose a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) to exploit mutual information for aggregating attribute characteristics from different images, enhancing the representation capabilities of feature embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our AiT in learning robust and discriminative representations. As a result, the authors achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods on several challenging benchmarks without any bells and whistles.

AB This paper presents a novel tuning method of a complex multiresonant current controller (MRCC). An online auto-tuning process is proposed to provide optimal coefficients suitable for the real-time operation of a grid-connected power converter. The time-consuming and inaccurate simulation stage based on the model of the plant is omitted. A novel function of constraints has been introduced into the optimization scheme to ensure the desired behavior of the control system. In this solution, the noise level of a control signal and the rise time of controlled currents are directly defined. To the author's best knowledge, it is the first time when such a solution is proposed. Next, the most commonly used meta-heuristic optimization algorithms were applied to solve this particular optimization problem. Another original concept presented in the paper is the application of the disturbance-in-the-loop (DiL) approach. In this method, the distorted phase voltages are emulated during the tuning stage, and optimal coefficients of MRCC are selected in the off-grid operation of the power converter. The proposed solution ensures safe and efficient online tuning of the MRCC for an extremely simple performance index. As a result, the high-performance operation of the grid-connected inverter is achieved. A brief stability analysis based on Lyapunov's stability theory is included. Experimental results obtained for grid-connected inverter indicate superior disturbance attenuation and current tracking. Advantages of the proposed approach are exhibited when compared to two analytical reference solutions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Variational autoencoder; Disentangled representation learning;
   Generative models
AB Two recent works have shown the benefit of modeling both high-level factors and their related features to learn disentangled representations with variational autoencoders (VAE). We propose here a novel VAEbased approach that follows this principle. Inspired by conditional VAE, the features are no longer treated as random variables over which integration must be performed. Instead, they are deterministically computed from the input data using a neural network whose parameters can be estimated jointly with those of the decoder and of the encoder. Moreover, the quality of the generated images has been improved by using discrete latent variables and a two-step learning procedure, which makes it possible to increase the size of the latent space without altering the disentanglement properties of the model. Results obtained on two different datasets validate the proposed approach that achieves better performance than the two aforementioned works in terms of disentanglement, while providing higher quality images.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Multi-sensor; Enhanced fusion; Complex environment; 3D position;

AB In this paper, an end-to-end learning framework-RGB enhanced point cloud fusion network (REPF-Net) is designed based on the complementary and enhanced fusion of multi-sensor (camera and lidar) data, aiming to realize the accurate perception of the robot in a random complex environment. In other words, the three-dimensional position and geometric shape of environmental targets can be obtained excellently and the accuracy of target recognition can be improved. Meanwhile, three key problems in 3D perception tasks were solved including, enhancing the fusion point cloud with RGB feature points, achieving effective fusion of heterogeneous data, and enhancing the skeleton information of the target point set. Point-by-point channel attention network (PCA-Net) is proposed to obtain the deep image features. The loss of attention consistent execution (ACE) loss function is proposed to overcome the inconsistencies of localization and classification confidence. Numerous experiments on the KITTI dataset prove that the proposed REPF-Net is superior to the currently common advanced 3D sensing algorithms.

TI Differentiable learning of rules with constants in knowledge graph

DE Rule mining; Knowledge graph; Rule with constants
AB Knowledge reasoning helps overcome the incompleteness of knowledge graphs (KGs) and has significantly contributed to the development of large KGs. Rule mining, one of the key tasks of knowledge reasoning, studies the problem of learning interpretable inference patterns over KGs. Existing rule mining methods mainly focus on learning rules that consist of different relations and variables, restricting the form of rules to be closed path. While rules could be diverse and in order to enrich the forms of rules, we argue that constants should also be considered in the rule mining process. We propose an Elegant Differentiable rUle learning with Constant mEthod (EduCe).1 We propose a constant operator and dynamic weight mechanism, which choose the constants that should be added and decrease the number of parameters, respectively. The model could mine diverse and accurate rules in an efficient way with these modules. The experimental results on several knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that EduCe achieves state-of-the-art link prediction results among differentiable rule mining methods and successfully learns diverse and high-quality rules. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Early detection of disinformation is one of the most challenging big-scale problems facing present day society. This is why the application of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing is necessary. The vast majority of Artificial Intelligence approaches require annotated data, and generating these resources is very expensive. This proposal aims to improve the efficiency of the annotation process with a two-level semi-automatic annotation methodology. The first level extracts relevant information through summarization techniques. The second applies a Human-in-the-Loop strategy whereby the labels are pre-annotated by the machine, corrected by the human and reused by the machine to retrain the automatic annotator. After evaluating the system, the average annotation time per news item is reduced by 50%. In addition, a set of experiments on the semi-automatically annotated dataset that is generated are performed so as to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal. Although the dataset is annotated in terms of unreliable content, it is applied to the veracity detection task with very promising results (0.95 accuracy in reliability detection and 0.78 in veracity detection).& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID ATTENTION
AB The emergence of the Transformer optimizes the interactive modeling of multimodal information in visual question answering (VQA) tasks, helping machines better understand multimodal information. The existing Transformer-based end-to-end methods have made some achievements in applying the Encoder-Decoder (E-D) mode or realizing complete interaction. However, almost no methods combine the advantages of the two well and give full play to them. Thus, this paper designs a complete language-vision interaction network (CLVIN) for VQA based on the implementation of the quadratic E-D mode. Based on the core framework of the modular co-attention network (MCAN), CLVIN achieves the complete interaction of multimodal information by using the E-D mode again, realizing the rational distribution of the question words' weight information. In addition, to reduce the additional consumption of time and memory caused by introducing the quadratic E-D mode, this paper proposes a compact method called CLVIN-c through optimizing the underlying implementation of the scaled dot-product attention in Transformer. Finally, a series of experimental results based on the dataset VQA-v2.0 and CLEVR show that CLVIN has a significant performance improvement, and CLVIN-c achieves further optimizations in model size and performance.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Facial expressions are one of the most essential channels to communicate a person's emotional state. In social interaction, the capability to accurately read subtle changes in facial expressions, which reveal emotional fluctuations, is critical for 1) comprehending others' emotions in context and background situations, 2) identifying responsiveness to others' emotions, and 3) developing social skills in human-computer interaction. In this paper, we first introduce automatic emotion change detection via facial expression that discovers timings or temporal locations in a video where facial expression significantly changes. We propose a weakly-supervised deep emotion change detection framework that does not require facial expression videos with expensive temporal annotations and instead learns static images for training. Incorporating these ideas, we performed extensive experiments to demonstrate fundamental insights into emotion change detection and the efficacy of our framework using three video datasets, i.e., CASME II, MMI, and our YoutubeECD. Furthermore, we modified our framework for temporal spotting, which is the most similar task to emotion change detection, and showed comparable results with state-of-the-art methods on CAS(ME)2, proving justification for the problem. Even though we only employed the AffectNet to train our framework rather than the CASME II, MMI, YoutubeECD, and CAS (ME)2, experimental results demonstrate its exceptional generalization capability in cross-dataset environments.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB This article concerns the fixed-time (FET) and prescribed-time (PET) synchronization of quaternion-valued fuzzy BAM neural networks via aperiodic intermittent pinning control. First of all, two improved inequalities for FET and PET stability are proposed to reduce the conservatism of existing results in the-oretical analysis. Subsequently, by excluding the control input of the rest interval in previous semi -intermittent design, two novel quaternion-valued aperiodic intermittent pinning controllers are devel-oped. Furthermore, regarding the original quaternion-valued networks as an entirety instead of decom-posing it into four real-valued subnetworks, several sufficient criteria that ensure the FET and PET synchronization of quaternion-valued fuzzy BAM neural networks are obtained by means of the improved stability inequalities and the designed controllers. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is verified by three numerical examples.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this study, new models based on quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) have been proposed for the prediction of autoignition temperature (AIT) and flash point (FP) of different alkyl esters. In this regard, data sets containing 126 and 179 alkyl esters from 10 categories were used for AIT and FP, respectively. The enhanced replacement method (ERM) was applied for choosing the appropriate molecular descriptors, and linear models were developed based on the selected descriptors. Nonlinear models were also developed for AIT and FP using genetic programming (GP), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Then, the predictive performance of each model was evaluated through internal and external validation techniques considering several statistical parameters such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent of average absolute relative deviation (AARD). The outcome of the validation techniques confirmed the satisfactory agreement between the predicted and experimental data. The AARD%, R2, and RMSE for the best corresponding models (GP-based nonlinear models) was reported as 4.54%, 0.74, and 39.01 for AIT and 2.51%, 0.98, and 12.32 for FP, respectively. The superiority of the new models over the previous models was also proved by comparing the prediction capability of different models.

AB Climate change affects the world. Due to excessive GHG emissions, urban transportation contributes to this threat. Policymakers and authorities want to reduce transportation-related GHG emissions. An imaginary urban area with high transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions, dense, interconnected transportation modes, and a high population density is considered. Istanbul, Turkey meets the criteria of this imaginary place, so the case analysis considers this city. Istanbul's decision-makers are looking for effective strategies to prioritize urban climate change policy alternatives for transportation activities. Four alternative strategies and 13 criteria are presented in this context. Innovative multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method with the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets (IVFFSs) strategies is proposed for advantage-prioritization so decision-makers can select the most effective strategies for policies. Utilizing the IVFFSs, the proposed method effectively tackles the qualitative/quantitative data and uncertain information that occurs in realistic applications. In this study, firstly IVFF-heronian mean operators with their desirable characteristics are presented to aggregate the IVFF information. The proposed operators can overcome the drawbacks of existing IVFF information-based operators by considering the relationships between IVFF numbers. Based on IVFF heronian mean operators, a hybrid decision-making framework is proposed by integrating criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC), rank sum (RS), and the double normalization-based multi-aggregation (DNMA) methods with IVFF information. In this method, the CRITIC and RS methods are implemented to derive the objective and subjective weights of the considered evaluation criteria and DNMA is applied to prioritize urban climate change policy alternatives for transportation activities. Sensitivity and comparative analyses with existing studies confirm the proposed framework. The evaluation results show that the integration of transportation sectors, strategies, and innovations across different urban areas in all regions option has the highest overall utility degree (0.731) among a set of four urban climate change policy alternatives for transportation activities.

ID GROUNDWATER LEVEL
AB The few-shot classification (FSC) task aims to classify data with limited labeled examples across different categories. Typically, researchers pre-train a feature extractor using base data and use it to extract features from novel data for classification Notably, the novel set only has a few annotated samples and has non-overlapped categories from the base set, which leads to the fact that the pre-trained feature extractor cannot adapt to the novel data flawlessly. We dub this problem as Feature-Extractor-Maladaptive (FEM) problem. Starting from the root cause of this problem, this paper presents a new scheme called Component Supervised Network (CSN), to improve the performance of FSC. We believe that even though the categories in the base and novel sets are different, their sample components share similarities. For example, both cats and dogs contain leg and head components. These entity components are intra-class stable and have cross-category versatility, making them useful for generalization to new categories. However, finding common information among different categories is difficult in real-world scenarios, hindering the possibility of modeling based on this assumption. To overcome this, we first design a Dictionary-based Implicit-Component Generator (DICG) to mine common information of different sets; then construct an implicit-component-based auxiliary task to improve the adaptability of the feature extractor. We evaluated our CSN on three benchmark datasets (mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, and FC100) and achieved improvements of at least 0.9% compared to classical methods, demonstrating the efficiency of our approach.

AB Numerous finance-based projects encounter disturbances from a variety of uncertain factors during their execution, under which both the original baseline schedule and financing alternative become infeasible. How-ever, many previous studies on the finance-based project scheduling problem (FBSP) neglected a potential feature of stochastic activity durations. In this paper, we address the issue of generating a robust project schedule that not only satisfies financing credit and renewable resource limits, but also tackles disruptions due to activity uncertainty. A bi-objective model for finance-based and resource-constrained robust project scheduling problem (FBRCRPSP) is constructed, where the trade-off between profit and robustness is considered. Based on the transformed integer programming model, an exact procedure of & epsilon;-constraints is proposed to obtain Pareto-optimal solutions for small-sized instances. For large-scale projects, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with local search (NSGA-II-LS) that deeply explores the neighboring solution space is developed, in which a generic procedure with two new recursion policies is proposed to determine the robustness of schedules. Benchmarking is conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the algorithms via some performance criteria. The re-sults show that all developed approaches have good performance in small-sized instances, and the NSGA-II-LS outperforms the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm without local search (NSGA-II) in terms of the spread, convergence, and diversity of Pareto-optimal solutions significantly. In addition, some managerial in-sights are summarized to enlighten project managers.

DE Semantic segmentation; Weakly supervised learning; Attention modulation
AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) approaches aim at pixel-level semantic category prediction using only image-level labels. The existing classifier-based method ReCAM has achieved good results, however, the classifiers tend to only focus on the most discriminative regions, resulting in an uneven distribution of fea-tures in the resulting class activation maps (CAMs). Besides, the classifiers are susceptible to image background interference and generate false activation mapping. To solve the above problems, we propose an improved method IAC-ReCAM, which introduces an activation network that integrated attention modulation and category label guidance based on the ReCAM method. We utilize the attention modulation module to reassign the feature distribution of the CAMs from the perspective of channels and spaces in turn. Meanwhile, we use the class label guidance module to suppress the generation of false activation mapping. Furthermore, we verified the effective-ness of the IAC-ReCAM method improvement work on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, our method outperforms a large number of existing mainstream methods. Among them, compared with the ReCAM method, the mIoU of the pseudo-labels on the two datasets is improved by 2.9% and 1%, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID INFORMATION FUSION; MECHANISM; LSTM
AB Fusion and co-learning are major challenges in multimodal sentiment analysis. Most existing methods either ignore the basic relationships among modalities or fail to maximize their potential correlations. They also do not leverage the knowledge from resource-rich modalities in the analysis of resource-poor modalities. To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal sentiment analysis method based on multilevel correlation mining and self-supervised multi-task learning. First, we propose a unimodal feature fusion-and linguistics guided Transformer-based framework, multi-level correlation mining framework, to overcome the difficulty of multimodal information fusion. The module exploits the correlation information between modalities from low to high levels. Second, we divided the multimodal sentiment analysis task into one multimodal task and three unimodal tasks (linguistic, acoustic, and visual tasks), and designed a self-supervised label generation module (SLGM) to generate sentiment labels for unimodal tasks. SLGM-based multi-task learning overcomes the lack of unimodal labels in co-learning. Through extensive experiments on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets, we demonstrated the superiority of the proposed multi-level correlation mining framework to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Liver disease is a potentially asymptomatic clinical entity that may progress to patient death. This study proposes a multi-modal deep neural network for multi-class malignant liver diagnosis. In parallel with the portal venous computed tomography (CT) scans, pathology data is utilized to prognosticate primary liver cancer variants and metastasis. The processed CT scans are fed to the deep dilated convolution neural network to explore salient features. The residual connections are further added to address vanishing gradient problems. Correspondingly, five pathological features are learned using a wide and deep network that gives a benefit of memorization with generalization. The down-scaled hierarchical features from CT scan and pathology data are concatenated to pass through fully connected layers for classification between liver cancer variants. In addition, the transfer learning of pre-trained deep dilated convolution layers assists in handling insufficient and imbalanced dataset issues. The fine-tuned network can predict three-class liver cancer variants with an average accuracy of 96.06% and an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.832. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to classify liver cancer variants by integrating pathology and image data, hence following the medical perspective of malignant liver diagnosis. The comparative analysis on the benchmark dataset shows that the proposed multi-modal neural network outperformed most of the liver diagnostic studies and is comparable to others.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The analysis of mixtures is a routine task in the analytical chemistry area as well as in other research fields. The objective is to identify, quantify, and interpret the chemical components of the mixtures. Various bilinear factor decomposition methods, including MCR-ALS, NMFand BNFA, have been proposed to solve this problem. However, there is little knowledge about their comparative performance in terms of different factors, such as solution reliability, calculation speed, convergence, flexibility in constraint implementation, and ease of results interpretation. To address these issues, this work aims to compare these methods using data examples from data simulations, environmental source apportionment studies, and chromatographic analysis of chemical mixtures. Through this comparison, we hope to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each method and provide recommendations for researchers working in this field. This comprehensive comparison will help researchers choose the appropriate method for their specific analysis needs, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient analysis.

   learning; Complementary information; Graph structure learning
AB Network representation learning has achieved significant success in homogeneous network data analysis in recent years. Nevertheless, they cannot be directly applied in multiplex networks. To overcome the characteristic of heterogeneity in multiplex networks, several emerging methods utilize the concept of meta-path to denote different types of relations and obtain the node representations for each type of meta-path individually. Despite the remarkable progress, there still exist two important issues in the previous approaches. First, the complementary information between different types of meta-paths that may make the representations more discriminative, is rarely investigated. Second, current studies generally learn multiplex node representations based on the original graph structure, while overlooking the latent relations between nodes. To address the aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel model with Meta-path Infomax joint Structure Enhancement (MISE) for multiplex network representations. Specifically, we first develop a meta-path infomax mechanism, which maximizes the mutual information between local and global meta-path representations, making the node representation contain more complementary information. Additionally, we propose a graph structure learning module that captures the implicit correlations between nodes to construct the latent graph structure. Such structure enhancement is a simple yet surprisingly effective technique to learn high-quality representations. We sufficiently evaluate the performance of our proposal on both supervised and unsupervised downstream tasks. Comprehensive experimental results show that our MISE achieves a promising boost in performance on a variety of real-world datasets for multiplex network representation learning.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The evolution of social media and online platforms created more opportunities to express one's thoughts without any burden. This emergence paved the way to construct more intelligent systems but by taking advantage of these platforms some people display their vengeance by harassing or abusing comments. The attackers leak sensitive information about an individual or an organization through the internet using abusive words, hate comments, threatening information, fake news, etc. So, online shaming detection with an optimum classification mechanism becomes necessary to avoid such negative consequences. In this paper, a novel online shaming detection mechanism using a Convolutional Neural Network Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-based Hybrid Archimedes Tasmanian Devil (CNNBiGRU-HATD) approach is proposed to detect and classify the offensive comments and non-offensive comments. If the comment seems offensive, it is further classified into six categories according to shaming types such as abusive, doxing, Passing Judgment, Ethnic/Religious, Joke/Sarcasm, and Whataboutery. The utilized four Twitter-based datasets are initially preprocessed and feature extracted to improve the classification performance of the CNNBiGRU-HATD approach. After accurate classification, the information from the classified shaming types is collected and authenticated. The proposed approach is simulated using the Python platform. To validate the potential capability of the proposed CNNBiGRU-HATD approach, it is related to the existing methods by various parameters. The experimental result reveals that the proposed CNNBiGRU-HATD method achieves higher accuracy of 96.5% for the labeled hate speech detection dataset.

AB Nuclei segmentation has great significance in biomedical applications as the preliminary step for disease diagnosis and treatment analysis. In this study, we propose a model for automated nuclei identification of varying cell shapes and types from microscopy images. Identifying nuclei helps to understand the underlying mechanism of various diseases in their early stages and provides solutions to enable faster cures. The foremost aim of the study is to develop a lightweight model, capable of segmenting varied shapes and sizes. The proposed architecture exploits multi-scale low-level features following dense high-level feature extraction with multi-feature fusion and special skip connections resulting in enhanced learning capability. The multi-scale feature extractor module extracts low-level information which is further processed using attention-based dense connections to extract semantically meaningful information. The special short-skip residual connections replacing long-skip connections reduced the semantic gap between encoder-decoder features. Moreover, the context encoder module extracts higher-level contextual information of different receptive fields using dilated convolutions making the model robust to different shapes and sizes. The higher-level feature maps propagate upward the decoder connections following the shared attention mechanism of an encoder to decoder features to reconstruct a better segmentation map. Moreover, the evaluation scheme following the proposed test-time augmentation operations improved the mean segmentation performance. The experiments on KDSB18, Synthetic cells, Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), MoNuSeg, CryoNuSeg, and BUS datasets demonstrate the suitability of the model for the nuclei segmentation tasks. The DRI-UNet model holds good segmentation performance outperforming baseline architecture by 8.12%, 4.71%, 10.19%, 2.46%, 3.14%, 8.91%, and 9.32% on KDSB18, synthetic cells, TNBC, MoNuSeg, CryoNuSeg, CVC-ClinicDB, and BUS datasets, respectively. We further conducted generalization tests of the proposed model for cross-dataset validation, and two independent MIS datasets confirm model effectiveness for nuclei cell and biomedical image segmentation.

AB Spain is the third-largest producer of pork meat in the world, and many farms in several regions depend on the evolution of this market. However, the current pricing system is unfair, as some actors have better market information than others. In this context, historical pricing is an easy-to-find and affordable data source that can help all agents to be better informed. However, the time lag in data acquisition can affect their pricing decisions. In this paper, we study the effect that data acquisition delay has on a price prediction system using multiple prediction algorithms. We describe the integration of the best proposal into a decision support system prototype and test it in a real-case scenario. Specifically, we use public data from the most important regional pork meat markets in Spain published by the Ministry of Agriculture with a two-week delay and subscription-based data of the same markets obtained on the same day. The results show that the error difference between the best public and data subscription models is 0.6 Euro cents in favour of the data without delay. The market dimension makes these differences significant in the supply chain, giving pricing agents a better tool to negotiate market prices.

ID SCHEME
AB Due to the large amount of textual data, text classification is a crucial problem in the modern era. In text classification studies, feature selection is one of the most crucial processes because it has a big impact on classification accuracy. Many feature selection techniques are suggested in the field of text classification in the literature. Each method sorts the features by assigning a score according to its algorithm. Then, the classification process is performed by selecting top-N features. However, the feature order for each method is different from each other. Each method selects by assigning a high score to the features that are important according to its algorithm, while it does not select by assigning a low score to the insignificant features. However, each method selects different distinguishing features according to its algorithm. With combinations of these distinguishing features, a higher performance classification process can be achieved. So, the classification process is to combine the features in a different order according to each method in this study. Thus, it will be observed which methods are successful or unsuccessful when combined. In addition, it was observed that the methods chose how many different features from each other. Accordingly, the classification is made by combining the features of different sizes and combining two local and two global feature selection methods. Numerous studies using three benchmark datasets have shown that the combination of feature selection approaches performs better than any single feature selection method used alone. However, some combinations have lower performance rates than individual methods. Thus, a comprehensive study was carried out in text classification domain.

AB Machine reading comprehension is introduced to improve machines' readability and understandability of human languages. This sophisticated version of natural language processing is used for testing and improving the machine's efficiency for reading and responding to the input texts for appropriate queries. In this article, a persistent comprehensive model using query reconstruction is introduced to address the "Cloze Style" issue in text reading. This issue results in multiple output delivery that serves as irrelevant for different input queries. Therefore, the query reconstruction using the possible combination, reducing the aforementioned issue, is introduced in this model. The possible query keywords are replaced using the maximum individual combinations. The combinations are swapped using deep learning through keyword training and substitution processes. This process is persistent until the maximum text output (answer/ response) is obtained from the machine. The output is used for analyzing the understandability of the machine based on which the training intensity is tuned for successive iterations. Therefore, the proposed model scrutinizes output accuracy by reducing errors under controlled combination time.

AB Online Q & A communities provide Internet users with an online platform for knowledge dissemination, communication and sharing. The characteristics of blockchain technology, such as untampered, traceability, and data up-chaining, can help solve the problems of knowledge privacy protection, affirming knowledge Ownership, and trust deficit faced by users when sharing knowledge in traditional online Q & A communities, and enhance users' willingness to share knowledge on the platform. Studying users' perceived characteristics and usage attitudes toward blockchain embedded in online platforms is important for enhancing users' willingness to share knowledge and exploring the management mechanism of blockchain technology on online platforms. Based on the task-technology matching theory and technology acceptance model, this paper explores the impact of task-technology matching on users' perceived characteristics and digs deeper into how users' perceived characteristics of blockchain technology affect users' usage attitudes and thus stimulate users' willingness to share knowledge. Task-technology matching also positively influences users' willingness to share knowledge by positively affecting perceived characteristics and users' attitudes toward using. The findings of the study provide inspiration and guidance on how platforms can use new technologies to enhance users' willingness to share knowledge.

AB In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that can provide human-centric explanations for decisions or predictions. No matter how good and efficient an AI model is, users or practitioners find it difficult to trust it if they cannot understand the AI model or its behaviours. Incorporating explainability that is human-centric in event detection systems is significant for building a decision-making process that is more trustworthy and sustainable. Human-centric and semantics-based explainable event detection will achieve trustworthiness, explainability, and reliability, which are currently lacking in AI systems. This paper provides a survey on human-centric explainable AI, explainable event detection, and semantics-based explainable event detection by answering some research questions that bother on the characteristics of human-centric explanations, the state of explainable AI, methods for human-centric explanations, the essence of human-centricity in explainable event detection, research efforts in explainable event solutions, and the benefits of integrating semantics into explainable event detection. The findings from the survey show the current state of human-centric explainability, the potential of integrating semantics into explainable AI, the open problems, and the future directions which can guide researchers in the explainable AI domain.

TI EORNet: An improved rotating box detection model for counting juvenile

SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DE Juvenile fish; Occlusion; Overlap; Rotation box; Detection; Count
AB The juvenile fish cultivation stage is a very critical stage in the aquaculture process, and real-time monitoring and statistics of the number of juvenile fish is very important for the management of the aquaculture process. However, there are small targets, occlusion, and overlapping phenomena in cultivation stage, which seriously hinder the accurate detection and counting of juvenile fish. Conventional horizontal box detection has the phenomenon of feature reuse between targets in the face of severe occlusion or overlap. Therefore, this study tried to use the rotating box detection model to explore its ability to solve occlusion and overlap problems. First of all, this study constructed a data set of two kinds of juvenile fish in the incubation stage (including Brocarded Carp and Carp). Secondly, on the basis of Oriented RepPoints, the ECA attention mechanism is introduced to strengthen the feature map output at the end of the backbone feature extraction network, and an improved rotation box detection model EORNet is obtained. Finally, based on EORNet, the actual modeling effects (counting) of rotation box and horizontal box are compared to further explore the advantages of rotation box in mitigating occlusion and overlap problems. The results showed that the Recall and Precision of the rotation box detection model in the detection task reached 0.978 and 0.905 respectively, and the R2 of the counting model in the counting task reached 0.937. The rotating frame detection method has been proved to be superior to the horizontal frame detection method in mitigating occlusion and overlap problems, and the rotating box detection is more conducive to capturing the key feature information of the target object, and then achieving accurate prediction. In addition to counting, the rotating box detection method is also expected to be used to accurately estimate the length, width and weight of aquaculture objects in the process of aquaculture.

AB mAp-independence is a novel concept concerned with explaining the (ir)relevance of intermediate nodes for maximum a posteriori (mAp) computations in Bayesian networks. Building upon properties of mAp-independence, we introduce and experiment with methods for finding sets of relevant nodes using both an exhaustive and a heuristic approach. Our experiments show that these properties significantly speed up run time for both approaches. In addition, we link mAp-independence to defeasible reasoning, a type of reasoning that analyses how new evidence may invalidate an already established conclusion. Ways to present users with an explanation using mAp-independence are also suggested.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB To compute the optimal strategy in competitive games, algorithms have been developed to achieve the Nash equilibrium. Current deep learning algorithms have succeeded in many games; however, optimizing the algorithms to approach the Nash equilibrium in imperfect-information games like StarCraft and Poker remains challenging. Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) is an effective end-to-end algorithm to learn an approximate Nash equilibrium in imperfect-information games. However, because a player in NFSP trains its best response according to its opponents' past strategies, a discrepancy exists between the optimal strategy and the learned best response after the player updates its strategies. We call this discrepancy the optimality gap. During training, the optimality gap does not decay monotonically, which causes suboptimal results or unstable convergence of NFSP. We improve the performance of NFSP by allowing the optimality gap to decay monotonically. In this study, we propose Regret Minimization Fictitious Self-Play (RM-FSP), which applies a regret minimization method to compute NFSP's best response. The regret minimization method effectively converges the optimality gap monotonically and faster than in NFSP. We prove there will be a better learning bound than the original NFSP after applying regret minimization methods to NFSP. Experiments on three typical environments in OpenSpiel demonstrate that RM-FSP outperforms NFSP in both exploitability (discrepancy between the learned policy profile and the Nash equilibrium) and time efficiency.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID PERSPECTIVE
AB With the widespread popularization of social network platforms, user-generated content and other social network data are growing rapidly. It is difficult for social users to select interested contents from the numerous social data. To alleviate information overload problem and enhance overall user experience of social networks, recommendation systems relying on historical behavioural data and social friendship relations of users, are widely used in social networks. Although researches on social recommendations have been conducted in recent years, recommendation systems of social networks still suffer from several challenges, such as data sparsity and lower performance. Since graph neural network has huge advantages in graph data learning by aggregating neighbors representations of the central node, it has been gathering pace in recent years. In this survey, we review graph neural network based literature for solving recommendation problems in social networks. We first introduce backgrounds of graph neural network and recommendation systems in social networks. Then, for different types of recommendation problems in social networks, we review different graph neural network based recommendation methods briefly. In particular, we first review GNN-based methods for general social recommendation and then review GNNbased methods for different social recommendation scenarios (such as friend recommendation and point of-interest recommendation). Finally, we briefly discuss promising future directions of the graph neural network based recommendation in social networks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The growing demand for semi-autonomous human-machine systems has led to an increased require-ment for human fatigue detection. Direct and invasive approaches for microsleep detection include cognitive computing methods using Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). The contextual integration of multi-channel or heterogeneous signals for sleep staging remains a formidable challenge. In addition, the cost of acquiring many signals is significantly higher than that of acquiring a single signal. Consequently, researchers have recently attempted to utilize single-channel EEG over multi-channel acquisition systems for sleep staging. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) has been widely used in previous research findings for spectral analysis of complex time-series data streams. In contrast to the FFT, we uti-lize here, for the first time, the Welch Transform which can give higher stability in noise reduction for spectral analysis. Specifically, we provide a novel method to implement the short-time Welch transform (STWT) as an enhanced technique for the spectro-temporal analysis of single-electrode EEG signals. Further, our proposed model utilizes attention-based spatial and channel-wise inter-dependencies using a one-dimensional causal convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract contextual features automati-cally. Finally, we demonstrate an end-to-end proof of concept for our data extraction, adaptive data resampling, manual feature extraction, and deep-neural network-based modeling architecture. Comparative simulation results using the benchmark, maintenance of wake-fullness test (MWT) dataset for microsleep detection during automobile transportation, show that our proposed end-to-end system, utilizing novel STWT-based enhanced spectro-temporal analysis, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, delivering 95% and 89% test accuracy for the case of temporal and spectral data inputs, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Detecting steel-surface defects is a crucial phase in steel manufacturing; however, accurately completing the detection task is challenging. The Swin Transformer, a self-attention-based model, has shown strong performance in the field of computer vision to enhance the adaptability of the Swin Transformer to the task of steel-surface defect detection, and a new network architecture called the LSwin Transformer is proposed in this study. First, in the downsampling process, we propose a convolutional embedding module and an attention patch merging module, which simultaneously strengthen the connections between the feature map channels, reduce the resolution, and increase image information retention. Second, we propose an effective window shift strategy and a convenient computation approach to make a complete defect between patches have more opportunity to obtain interactive computing. Finally, to combine the feature extraction capability of convolutional neural networks with the global dependency building capability of the Swin Transformer, we propose a depth multilayer perceptron module. Numerous experiments were conducted on a steel-surface defect dataset. The results demonstrated that the detection effect of our model outperformed competing methods, with a mean average precision of 81.2 %. In the ablation study, we verified the effectiveness of each module and initialized the parameters of the model through transfer learning to accelerate the convergence of the model. Therefore, the proposed LSwin Transformer has significant potential for detecting steel-surface defects.

SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING

DE Deep features; Easy-pair; Fixed age group dataset; Kinship Verification
AB Kinship Verification (KV) by using facial images is a relevant and challenging research problem in the field of computer vision. Facial features are extracted from the input pair of images and subsequently analyzed to find out existence of kin relation between them. Weights of the training model are suitably learned and adapted for the same. In most of the existing schemes, non kin pairs are randomly generated from the existing kin pair database for the learning process of the model. Since non-kin pairs are formed randomly from the true kin pair database itself, hence there is a significant probability that some non kin pairs have more similarity in feature space which is ideally undesirable and leads to improper learning of the model and results into errors. To reduce such errors, we have proposed a new scheme called easy-pair selection method for KV. Kin and non kin pairs are categorized into easy and hard pairs based on sum of square distance with respect to the feature space of the pairs. Suitable kin-margin (KM) value is chosen to classify the pair as easy or hard. Further, selected easy pairs are used to compute the optimized training weights (W) from the training dataset. The obtained weights will ensure to minimize the distance of kin pairs and maximize the distance of non-kin pairs in feature space. A fixed age group image database (FAG) have also been proposed through this article which contains the corresponding facial images of the parents and their children from the same age group to minimize the issue of age in-variance as well. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate the accuracy of the proposed scheme and is found to outperform the existing relevant schemes for KV.

AB Mineral knowledge acquisition is indispensable in geological research. Currently, mineral knowledge can be acquired though a search engine like Google, or though some mineral databases. But usually, the answers from the search engines are not professional enough, and the mineral databases cannot answer the questions input in natural language. In this paper, a Chinese mineral question and answering system based on knowledge graph is proposed with the aim of answering the mineral questions in Chinese natural language professionally, accurately and efficiently. Two deep learning models based on BERT are built to obtain mineral entities and relationships to construct the mineral knowledge graph. After the mineral knowledge graph is constructed, accordingly question templates are defined and another deep learning model based on BERT is built to recognize the intent and the entity/attribute of the input question. The query statement is generated according to the question template pre-defined and is input to the mineral knowledge graph constructed. Then the answer to the question is returned by the knowledge graph. The knowledge graph we constructed has 22,568 entities and 91,699 relationships, which is richer than most of the geological knowledge graph. The question and answering system achieve a 91.2% accuracy on the 2,000 test questions.

AB The belief rule-based (BRB) system has been one of the most significant rule-based systems for its ability to deal with various kinds of information under uncertainty, and it has shown great potential for classification problems. However, the combinatorial explosion problem hugely limits the application of the BRB system as excessive rules could not only increase the computation cost, but also impact the performance of the BRB system. Therefore, motivated by this problem, this paper proposed a fast and accurate belief rule base generation and reduction method. Firstly, a fast belief rule base generation method is introduced, where similar rules are grouped and combined to ensure all the possible situations are covered without generating excessive rules. Then, a redundancy-based belief rule base reduction method is proposed, where the redundancy degree of the belief rule that represents the degree to which a belief rule is affected by other rules is introduced, and it is calculated to identify redundant rules. Furthermore, the conventional evidential reasoning (ER)-based inference process is retained from conventional BRB systems. Thirty classification benchmarks from the well-known UCI machine learning repository are tested to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the results are compared with other rule-based systems, improved BRB systems, and other machine learning methods. Comparison results show that the proposed method could effectively reduce the size of the BRB without costing its accuracy. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis and robustness analysis are conducted, which further show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accurate segmentation of medical images plays a crucial role in diagnosing and treating diseases. Although many methods now use multimodal joint segmentation, the joint use of segmentation features extracted by multiple models can lead to heterogeneity and uncertainty. Unreasonable fusion methods cannot exploit the advantages of multiple models and still lack good performance in segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes the FTransCNN model, which is composed of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transformer and is based on a fuzzy fusion strategy that jointly utilizes the features extracted by a CNN and Transformer through a new fuzzy fusion module. First, the CNN and Transformer act as the backbone network for parallel feature extraction. Second, channel attention is used to promote the global key information of Transformer to improve the feature representation ability, and spatial attention is used to enhance the local details of CNN features and suppress irrelevant regions. Third, the proposed model applies the Hadamard product to model fine-grained interactions between the two branches and uses the Choquet fuzzy integral to suppress heterogeneity and uncertainty in fused features. Fourth, FTransCNN employs fuzzy attention fusion module (FAFM) hierarchical upsampling to effectively capture both low-level spatial features and high-level semantic context. Finally, the new model obtains the final segmentation result by using the deconvolution and results in an improvement in segmentation. The experimental results on Chest X-ray and Kvasir-SEG dataset show that FTransCNN has better performance on segmentation tasks than the-state-of-the-art deep segmentation models.

AB Although an independent metamodel may be used to accurately describe certain response relationships, it can be challenging to find suitable metamodels for various problems. The ensembled metamodel, in contrast, is a more universal method. The key to enhancing the performance of the ensembled metamodel is determining how to select the optimal set of metamodels to be ensembled (MBEs) and how to ensemble them to obtain a better fit. However, existing methods face challenges in exploring the fitting ability of individual metamodels within a preset sample set, often requiring prior knowledge or additional sample sets for assistance to get optimal MBEs, and they struggle to fully utilize the fitting ability of individual metamodels at each sample point. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel ensemble of metamodels using improved stepwise metamodel selection and two-layer pointwise ensemble (OSF-TLPE) through research in three aspects: model selection, weight calculation, and residual compensation. Firstly, the Leave-P-Out Prediction (LPOP) proposed in this paper reconstructs the response of the metamodel to the problem, which reduces the complexity of model selection. Then, considering the redundancy of the metamodel during ensemble, the Out-of-Bag Estimation (OOBE) based Stepwise Fit (OSF) eliminates redundancy as feature selection, which is a globally optimal method for metamodel selection. The two-layer pointwise ensemble of metamodels (TLPE), which consists of weight metamodels (WMs) and a residual metamodel (RM) provide a more robust ensemble strategy by assigning weights point by point and compensating for residuals. Finally, the performances of OSF and TLPE are evaluated on 12 benchmark functions using 6 and 13 typical metamodels, respectively. A performance comparison was also conducted on an aircraft final assembly line performance prediction problem. The results demonstrate that OSF-TLPE can deliver more flexible and reliable performances compared to common ensemble methods.

AB Program synthesis aims to automatically find programs from an underlying programming language that satisfy a given specification. While this has the potential to revolutionize computing, how to search over the vast space of programs efficiently is an unsolved challenge in program synthesis. In cases where large programs are required for a solution, it is generally believed that stochastic search has advantages over other classes of search techniques. Unfortunately, existing stochastic program synthesizers do not meet this expectation very well, suffering from the scalability issue. To overcome this problem, we propose a new framework for stochastic program synthesis, called iterative genetic improvement. The key idea is to apply genetic improvement to improve a current reference program, and then iteratively replace the reference program by the best program found. Compared to traditional stochastic synthesis approaches, iterative genetic improvement can build up the complexity of programs incrementally in a more robust way. We evaluate the approach on two program synthesis domains: list manipulation and string transformation, along with a number of general program synthesis problems. Our empirical results indicate that this method has considerable advantages over several representative stochastic program synthesizer techniques, both in terms of scalability and of solution quality. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, we argue that we cannot expect that AI systems-even given more data or better computational resources-will be more ethical than the humans who develop, deploy and use them. As such, we advocate that it is necessary to retain the responsibility for ethical decision-making in human hands. In reality, however, human decision-makers currently do not have the ethical maturity to meaningfully take on this responsibility. So, what to do? We develop the argument that to broaden and strengthen the ethical upskilling of our organizations and leaders, AI has a crucial role to play. Specifically, because AI is a mirror that reflects our biases and moral flaws back to us, decision-makers should look carefully into this mirror-taking advantage of the opportunities brought about by its scale, interpretability, and counterfactual modeling-to gain a deep understanding of the psychological underpinnings of our (un)ethical behaviors, and in turn, learn to consistently make ethical decisions. In discussing this proposal, we introduce a new collaborative paradigm between humans and AI that can help ethically upskill our organizations and leaders and thereby prepare them to responsibly navigate the impending digital future.

AB System design is an essential subject taught in information systems and has become a core course in its curriculum. Unified modelling language (UML) has been broadly adopted, and it is common to support the system design process using different diagrams. Each diagram serves a purpose by focusing on a specific part of a particular system. Design consistency ensures a seamless process, as the diagrams are generally interrelated. However, creating a well-designed system takes a lot of work, especially for university students with work experience. To overcome this challenge, aligning the concepts across diagrams is essential, which can help achieve better consistency and management of the design system, especially in an educational setting. This article is an extension of our previous work, as we have discussed a simple scenario of Automated teller machines to demonstrate the alignment concepts between UML diagrams. From a more technical perspective, the current contribution provides a Java program that aligns concepts by converting text-based use cases to text-based sequence diagrams. Then, the text is transformed in PlantUML to generate its graphical representation. The developed alignment tool is expected to contribute to helping students and instructors during the system design phases to be more consistent and practical. Limitations and future work are presented.

AB Due to the vast variety of aspects that must be made-many of which are in opposition to one another-choosing a home can be difficult for those without much experience. Individuals need to spend more time making decisions because they are difficult, which results in making poor choices. To overcome residence selection issues, a computational approach is necessary. Unaccustomed people can use decision support systems to help them make decisions of expert quality. The current article explains the empirical procedure in that field in order to construct decision-support system for selecting a residence. The main goal of this study is to build a weighted product mechanism -based decision-support system for residential preference. The said house short-listing estimation is based on several key requirements derived from the interaction between the researchers and experts. The results of the information processing show that the normalized product strategy can rank the available alternatives to help individuals choose the best option. The interval valued fuzzy hypersoft set (IVFHS-set) is a broader variant of the fuzzy soft set that resolves the constraints of the fuzzy soft set from the perspective of the utilization of the multi-argument approximation operator. This operator maps sub-parametric tuples into a power set of universe. It emphasizes the segmentation of every attribute into a disjoint attribute valued set. These characteristics make it a whole new mathematical tool for handling problems involving uncertainties. This makes the decision-making process more effective and efficient. Furthermore, the traditional TOPSIS technique as a multi-criteria decision-making strategy is discussed in a concise manner. A new decision-making strategy, "OOPCS"is constructed with modifications in TOPSIS for fuzzy hypersoft set in interval settings. The proposed strategy is applied to a real-world multi-criteria decision-making scenario for ranking the alternatives to check and demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness.

AB Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are intelligent transport subsystems; vehicles can communicate through a wireless medium in this system. There are many applications of VANETs such as traffic safety and preventing the accident of vehicles. Many attacks affect VANETs communication such as denial of service (DoS) and distributed denial of service (DDoS). In the past few years the number of DoS (denial of service) attacks are increasing, so network security and protection of the communication systems are challenging topics; intrusion detection systems need to be improved to identify these attacks effectively and efficiently. Many researchers are currently interested in enhancing the security of VANETs. Based on intrusion detection systems (IDS), machine learning (ML) techniques were employed to develop high-security capabilities. A massive dataset containing application layer network traffic is deployed for this purpose. Interpretability technique Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) technique for better interpretation model functionality and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing a random forest (RF) classifier achieves 100% accuracy, demonstrating its capability to identify intrusion-based threats in a VANET setting. In addition, LIME is applied to the RF machine learning model to explain and interpret the classification, and the performance of machine learning models is evaluated in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score.

AB With the massive use of social media today, mixing between languages in social media text is prevalent. In linguistics, the phenomenon of mixing languages is known as code -mixing. The prevalence of code-mixing exposes various concerns and challenges in natural language processing (NLP), including language identification (LID) tasks. This study presents a word-level language identification model for code-mixed Indonesian, Javanese, and English tweets. First, we introduce a code-mixed corpus for Indonesian -Javanese-English language identification (IJELID). To ensure reliable dataset annota-tion, we provide full details of the data collection and annotation standards construction procedures. Some challenges encountered during corpus creation are also discussed in this paper. Then, we investigate several strategies for developing code-mixed language identification models, such as fine-tuning BERT, BLSTM-based, and CRF. Our results show that fine-tuned IndoBERTweet models can identify languages better than the other techniques. This is the result of BERT's ability to understand each word's context from the given text sequence. Finally, we show that sub-word language representation in BERT models can provide a reliable model for identifying languages in code-mixed texts.

TI A New Hybrid Forecasting Model Based on Dual Series Decomposition with

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; PM2.5; OZONE
AB In recent years, ozone (O-3) has gradually become the primary pollutant plaguing urban air quality. Accurate and efficient ozone prediction is of great significance to the prevention and control of ozone pollution. The air quality monitoring network provides multisource pollutant concentration monitoring data for ozone prediction, but ozone prediction based on multisource monitoring data still faces the challenges of each station's series of data. Aiming at the problems of low prediction accuracy and low computational efficiency in traditional atmospheric ozone concentration prediction, ozone concentration prediction using dual series decomposition was proposed by variational mode decomposition (VMD), ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), and long short-term memory (LSTM). First, the historical data series of Nanjing air quality monitoring stations is decomposed by VMD, and then the EEMD algorithm is applied to the residual of VMD to obtain several characteristic intrinsic mode function (IMF) components; each characteristic IMF component is trained by LSTM to obtain the prediction result of each component, and then the final result can be obtained by linear superposition. The proposed method achieved the best results with R-2 = 99%, MSE = 5.38, MAE = 4.54, and MAPE = 3.12. Because LSTM has strong adaptive learning ability and good memory function, it has the learning advantage of long-term memory for long-term data, and the prediction results are more accurate. According to the data, the proposed method is superior to the baseline models in terms of statistical metrics. As a result, the proposed hybrid method can serve as a reliable model for ozone forecasting.

AB Recent neural architecture search (NAS) based approaches have made great progress in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks. However, the architectures are usually optimized independently of the network weights, increasing searching time and restricting model performances. To tackle these issues, in this paper, different from previous methods that extra define structural parameters, we propose to directly generate structural parameters by utilizing the specifically designed hyper kernels, ingeniously converting the original complex dual optimization problem into easily implemented one-tier optimizations, and greatly shrinking searching costs. Then, we develop a hierarchical multi-module search space whose candidate operations only contain convolutions, and these operations can be integrated into unified kernels. Using the above searching strategy and searching space, we obtain three kinds of networks to separately conduct pixel-level or image-level classifications with 1-D or 3-D convolutions. In addition, by combining the proposed hyper kernel searching scheme with the 3-D convolution decomposition mechanism, we obtain diverse architectures to simulate 3-D convolutions, greatly improving network flexibilities. A series of quantitative and qualitative experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results compared with other advanced NAS-based HSI classification approaches.

AB IntroductionHuman robot collaboration is quickly gaining importance in the robotics and ergonomics fields due to its ability to reduce biomechanical risk on the human operator while increasing task efficiency. The performance of the collaboration is typically managed by the introduction of complex algorithms in the robot control schemes to ensure optimality of its behavior; however, a set of tools for characterizing the response of the human operator to the movement of the robot has yet to be developed. MethodsTrunk acceleration was measured and used to define descriptive metrics during various human robot collaboration strategies. Recurrence quantification analysis was used to build a compact description of trunk oscillations. Results and discussionThe results show that a thorough description can be easily developed using such methods; moreover, the obtained values highlight that, when designing strategies for human robot collaboration, ensuring that the subject maintains control of the rhythm of the task allows to maximize comfort in task execution, without affecting efficiency.

AB Code clones are duplicated code snippets that significantly threaten software maintenance and the public corpora of code representation learning. Traditionally, code context and its structure information abstract syntax tree (AST), control flow graph (CFG) are typical representations of source code, and context-based models and structure-based models contributed significantly to the development of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a hybrid embedding model for code clone detection (HEM-CCD), a fusion method of token sequential information and graph-based structure information. We insert tokens' global context information encoded by a bi-directional recurrent neural network into the AST-based graph for comprehensive code semantic representation. Then, feeding the graph into a gated graph neural network we generate code semantic vectors for similarity evaluation. We have implemented our model on two public clone datasets (BigCloneBench and GoogleCodeJam), and the results indicate that HEM-CCD outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The problem addressed in this study is the limitations of previous works that considered electrocardiogram (ECG) classification as a multiclass problem, despite many abnormalities being diagnosed simultaneously in real life, making it a multilabel classification problem. The aim of the study is to test the effectiveness of deep learning (DL)-based methods (Inception, MobileNet, LeNet, AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50) using three large 12-lead ECG datasets to overcome this limitation. The define-by-run technique is used to build the most efficient DL model using the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) algorithm. Results show that the proposed methods achieve high accuracy and precision in classifying ECG abnormalities for large datasets, with the best results being 97.89% accuracy and 90.83% precision for the Ningbo dataset, classifying 42 classes for the Inception model; 96.53% accuracy and 85.67% precision for the PTB-XL dataset, classifying 24 classes for the Alex net model; and 95.02% accuracy and 70.71% precision for the Georgia dataset, classifying 23 classes for the Alex net model. The best results achieved for the optimum model that was proposed by the define-by-run technique were 97.33% accuracy and 97.71% precision for the Ningbo dataset, classifying 42 classes; 96.60% accuracy and 83.66% precision for the PTB-XL dataset, classifying 24 classes; and 94.32% accuracy and 66.97% precision for the Georgia dataset, classifying 23 classes. The proposed DL-based methods using the TPE algorithm provide accurate results for multilabel classification of ECG abnormalities, improving the diagnostic accuracy of heart conditions.

AB The emergence of altruistic behaviors in heterogeneous populations of autonomous robots, especially in signaling tasks, has proven to be a difficult problem to solve. However signaling and altruistic behaviors are present throughout the tree of life. Specially giving that, signaling behaviors seem to have evolved multiple times whenever there is a channel to emit a signal and one to receive it. In this work, this problem is addressed, using evolutionary algorithms, and modeling phenomena such as kin selection and kin discrimination in a biologically plausible way. We also used self-organizing maps to analyze the behavior of these populations during the evolutionary process, within the solution space. We believe that this approach can shed light on the predictive power of the Hamilton rule, the importance of kin selection in the evolution of altruistic behaviors, and how self-organizing maps can allow us to observe the different solutions in which the evolutionary algorithm converges through time.

AB The current paper addresses the problem of stabilizing multiple aerial robots cooperatively transporting a cable-suspended payload by an aeromechanic method. Instead of relying on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or vision and communication for agents to actively estimate and control the state of the multibody dynamics, lightweight air dampers to make the multiagent system inherently stable at its equilibrium state, permitting the robots to safely carry a load at a constant velocity are employed. This is achieved without additional state estimation or active correction. The proposed framework is proven stable and verified by simulations and extensive flight experiments. Lightweight mechanical dampers (under 7 g) are shown to be effective in attenuating undesired oscillations and overcoming disturbances. To this end, a team of four robots cooperatively transporting a payload over 20 m in open space is demonstrated, and three robots safely transporting a point-mass payload over a distance of 45 m outdoors. The promising outcomes highlight the benefits of the passive strategy, which demands minimal hardware components and computation to realize the sophisticated aerial transport task.

AB Inspired by the unique neurophysiology of the octopus, a hierarchical framework is proposed that simplifies the coordination of multiple soft arms by decomposing control into high-level decision-making, low-level motor activation, and local reflexive behaviors via sensory feedback. When evaluated in the illustrative problem of a model octopus foraging for food, this hierarchical decomposition results in significant improvements relative to end-to-end methods. Performance is achieved through a mixed-modes approach, whereby qualitatively different tasks are addressed via complementary control schemes. Herein, model-free reinforcement learning is employed for high-level decision-making, while model-based energy shaping takes care of arm-level motor execution. To render the pairing computationally tenable, a novel neural network energy shaping (NN-ES) controller is developed, achieving accurate motions with time-to-solutions 200 times faster than previous attempts. The hierarchical framework is then successfully deployed in increasingly challenging foraging scenarios, including an arena littered with obstacles in 3D space, demonstrating the viability of the approach.

AB Acoustic manipulation is a technique that uses sound waves to move particles, droplets, or cells. Closed-loop control methods based on complex, time-varying acoustic fields have been demonstrated, but usually require accurate models of the acoustic fields or many training experiments for successful manipulation. Herein, a new adaptive control method is proposed for the acoustic manipulation of single and multiple particles inside microfluidic chips. The method is based on online machine learning of the acoustic fields. Starting with no knowledge of the fields, the controller can manipulate particles even on the first attempt, and its performance improves in subsequent attempts, yet can still readapt if the models are invalidated by a sudden change in system parameters. The controller can generalize: it can use information learned from one task to improve its performance in other tasks. Despite the machine-learning nature of the controller, the internal models of the controller have a physical interpretation and correspond to the experimentally observed acoustic fields. The online adaptiveness of the controller should make it easier to use in practical applications, such as particle and cell sorting, microassembly, labs-on-chips, and diagnostic devices, as the method does not require extensive training or prior models.

ID DEEP NEURAL-NETWORKS; ATTENTION NETWORK
AB Pedestrian detection is an important task in many computer vision applications. Since multispectral pedestrian detection can alleviate the difficulties of insufficient illumination at night, it has been rapidly developed in recent years. However, the way for effective color-thermal image fusion still needs further research. In this paper, we propose a Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) that can adaptively capture the cross-channel and cross-dimension information interaction of the two modalities. In addition, we develop a Feature Aggregation Network (FANet) that embeds the proposed FAM module into a two-stream network adapted from the YOLOv5. FANet has the advantages that its size is small (15 MB) and it runs fast (8 ms per frame). Extensive experiments on the KAIST dataset show that the proposed method is effective for multispectral pedestrian detection, especially in the night-time condition, for which the Miss Rate is only 8.91%. Moreover, we show that the saliency map computed from the thermal image can be incorporated into FANet to further improve the detection accuracy. In order to verify the generalization ability of the FAM module, we have also conducted experiments on the person re-identification datasets, namely Market1501 and Duke. The performance of our FAM compares favorably against existing feature fusion mechanisms on the two datasets.

ID CALIBRATION; POSE; CLASSIFICATION
AB Accurate traffic density plays a pivotal role in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The current practice to obtain the traffic density is through specialized sensors. However, those sensors are placed in limited locations due to the cost of installation and maintenance. In most metropolitan areas, traffic surveillance cameras are widespread in road networks, and they are the potential data sources for estimating traffic density in the whole city. Unfortunately, such an application is challenging since surveillance cameras are affected by the 4L characteristics: Low frame rate, Low resolution, Lack of annotated data, and Located in complex road environments. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of holistic frameworks for estimating traffic density from traffic surveillance camera data with 4 L characteristics. Therefore, we propose a framework for estimating traffic density using uncalibrated traffic surveillance cameras. The proposed framework consists of two major components: camera calibration and vehicle detection. The camera calibration method estimates the actual length between pixels in the images and videos, and the vehicle counts are extracted from the deep-learning-based vehicle detection method. Combining the two components, high-granular traffic density can be estimated. To validate the proposed framework, two case studies were conducted in Hong Kong and Sacramento. The results show that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the estimated traffic density is 9.04 veh/km/lane in Hong Kong and 7.03 veh/km/lane in Sacramento. The research outcomes can provide accurate traffic density without installing additional sensors.

AB Fuzzy set (FS) theory and rough sets (RSs) are constructed to accommodate the data uncertainty. In contrast, the bipolar FS (BFS) theory can tackle the uncertainty and the bipolarity of the data in different circumstances. This article aims to introduce the idea of rough bipolar fuzzy ideals in semigroup (SG), which is a generalization of the concept of rough BFSs (RBFSs) in an SG. We also investigate the roughness in the bipolar fuzzy subsemigroup (BF-SSG) with the help of congruence relation (cng-R) defined on the SG and studied some relevant structural properties. Moreover, the idea is extended to the rough bipolar fuzzy left ideal, rough bipolar fuzzy right ideal, rough bipolar fuzzy two-sided ideal, rough bipolar fuzzy interior ideal, and rough bipolar fuzzy bi-ideal in SGs. Further, it is seen that cng-Rs and complete cng-Rs play vital roles in the construction of rough approximations of bipolar fuzzy ideals. Consequently, their associated properties are explored by using cng-Rs and complete cng-Rs.

AB A multi-objective social group optimization (MOSGO) is proposed in this study as a method for resolving problems with multiple objectives. The initial step is to use an external chronicle with a predetermined size to store the existing non-dominated Pareto optimum solutions. Following that, solutions are chosen from this repository using a roulette wheel mechanism based on the coverage of solutions to guide individuals in the direction of promising regions of multi-objective search spaces. The proposed method is tested on ten CEC2009 multi-objective benchmark problems and it has been compared to two well-known meta-heuristics: the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) algorithm and the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. It is essential to the machining processes to choose the optimum machining parameters in order to guarantee product quality, lower machining costs, boost productivity, and preserve resources for sustainability. Hence, MOSGO, a posterior multi-objective optimization method, is used in this study to tackle the multi-objective optimization problems of three machining processes, including turning, wire-electric-discharge machining, and laser cutting. The results of the MOSGO algorithm are compared with the results obtained using GA, NSGA-II, PSO, and iterative search methods and are found to be comparable. Here it has been observed that the MOSGO algorithm achieved the Pareto-optimal set of solutions in a very less number of function evaluations as compared to other algorithms showing a higher convergence speed. The Pareto-optimal set of solutions for each optimization problem is obtained and reported. These Pareto-optimal sets of solutions are helpful for real production systems and will aid the decision-maker in tumultuous situations.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Automatic detection of concealed plagiarism in the form of paraphrases is a difficult task, and finding a successful unsupervised approach for paraphrase detection is necessary as a precondition to change that. This comparative study identified the most efficient methods for unsupervised paraphrased document detection using similarity measures alone or combined with Deep Learning (DL) models. It proved the hypothesis that some DL models are more successful than the best statistically-based methods in that task. Many experiments were carried out, and their results were compared. The text similarities between documents are obtained from 60 different methods using five paraphrase corpora, including the new one made by authors, as an important original contribution. Some DL models achieved significantly better results than those obtained by the best statistical methods, especially pre-trained transformer-based language models with average values of Accuracy and F1 of 85.8% and 88.3%, respectively, with top values of 99.9% and 98.4% for Accuracy and F1 on some corpora. These results are even better than those of supervised and combined approaches. Therefore, here presented results prove that detecting concealed plagiarism becomes an attainable goal. This study highlighted those language models with the best overall results for paraphrase detection as best suited for further research. The study also discussed the choice of similarity/distance measure paired with embeddings produced by DL models and some advantages of using cosine similarity as the fastest measure. For 60 different methods, complexity has been defined in O notation. Times needed for their implementation have also been presented. The article's results and conclusions are a firm base for future semantic similarity, paraphrasing, and plagiarism detection studies, clearly marking state-of-the-art tools and methods.

AB The dendritic neuron model artificial neural network, in which the dendrites in the biological neuron are added to the artificial neural network model, has been able to perform better compared to other artificial neural network methods used in the literature for the analysis of time series. The contribution of this study to the literature is the proposal of bootstrapped dendritic neuron model artificial neural network method as a new artificial neural network approach. The performance of the proposed method is compared with long-short term memory, a deep artificial neural network, pi-sigma, a high order artificial neural network and bootstrap hybrid artificial neural network according to various statistics on BIST100 time series. As a result of the applications, the proposed bootstrapped dendritic neuron model artificial neural network produced the best results in all statistics in general. In particular, the low standard deviation of the bootstrap dendritic neuron model stood out as a reason for preference compared to the other three methods. It is concluded that the bootstrap dendritic neuron model artificial neural network can be preferred to other artificial neural network methods for the analysis of time series.

AB The detection of river boundaries is a crucial branch of the intelligent perception of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), it can be used to determine the driving areas of USVs, and also to ensure driving safety by limiting the effective drivable areas of USVs in the river areas. Aiming to detect the boundaries of incompletely structured river channels, this study proposes a real-time detection method for river boundaries based on a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor. The point clouds that are disturbed by the water surface noise are filtered firstly, and then the spatial and geometric features are extracted separately from the point cloud detected above the water surface. To prevent the error detection and missing detection, the boundary point information is predicted and calibrated in real time by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). A planning track generation algorithm for coastal autonomous cruise without relying on high-precision maps, and a heading and distance adaptive control method by Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), and different driving line generation methods for driving along the narrow river and wide river are proposed respectively. The experimental data verification of river boundary detection shows that the algorithm is accurate, real-time, and robust.

AB Optical character recognition (OCR) has proved a powerful tool for the digital analysis of printed historical documents. However, its ability to localize and identify individual glyphs is challenged by the tremendous variety in historical type design, the physicality of the printing process, and the state of conservation. We propose to mitigate these problems by a downstream fine-tuning step that corrects for pathological and undesirable extraction results. We implement this idea by using a joint energy-based model which classifies individual glyphs and simultaneously prunes potential out-of-distribution (OOD) samples like rubrications, initials, or ligatures. During model training, we introduce specific margins in the energy spectrum that aid this separation and explore the glyph distribution's typical set to stabilize the optimization procedure. We observe strong classification at 0.972 AUPRC across 42 lower- and uppercase glyph types on a challenging digital reproduction of Johannes Balbus' Catholicon, matching the performance of purely discriminative methods. At the same time, we achieve OOD detection rates of 0.989 AUPRC and 0.946 AUPRC for OOD 'clutter' and 'ligatures' which substantially improves upon recently proposed OOD detection techniques. The proposed approach can be easily integrated into the postprocessing phase of current OCR to aid reproduction and shape analysis research.

DE Chinese text recognition; Vision and language; Transformer
AB Chinese text line recognition technology has been applied in a variety of scenarios. As a kind of ideographic writing, Chinese characters contain plenty of semantic information and basic components. While previous methods mainly convert each Chinese character into a discrete label to facilitate the calculation of cross-entropy loss, leaving the fine-grained glyph information (e.g. strokes and radicals) and semantic information unexploited. Concretely, glyph information is crucial for recognizing Chinese characters with similar appearances, as these characters differ only slightly in local strokes. The glyph information reflects these differences guiding the model to learn fine-grained local features. And compared to discrete category labels, the character semantic information introduces diverse visual concepts, which enriches the final character representation. This paper presents a Chinese text recognition method that exploits glyph and character semantic information to acquire effective text representations. Specifically, we propose a Glyph-Aware Decoder to identify characters by dynamically fusing the global visual features with the local stroke and radical features. And we introduce a Contrastive Visual-Textual Learning module to enhance the visual features of Chinese characters by their semantic information. Experiments show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the Chinese text recognition benchmarks.

AB The determination of nitrite concentration is crucial due to its toxicity. A novel model has been developed to accurately determine nitrite concentration within the non-linear range, utilizing the Zambelli method. Previously, techniques for measure nitrite concentration were primarily restricted to the linear range. This new method employs UV-Visible absorption spectra and correlated component regression (CCR) to determine nitrite concentration within the range of 0.27-11.34 ppm. A wavelength selection strategy in conjunction with partial least squares (PLS) was implemented prior to applying CCR. The spectral data underwent pre-processing using standard normal variant (SNV) and Savitzky Golay (SG) techniques, and a backward selection (BS) strategy with PLS was applied to select wavelengths. The 15 most sensitive wavelengths, determined through the RMSECV criterion, were utilized to create a PLS model within the range 377-497 nm, resulting in a model with R-C(2) = 0.9999 and R-CV(2) = 0.9999, RMSEC = 0.006, RMSECV = 0.027. A CCR model was then established using the 15selected wavelengths and nitrite concentration. The results yielded strong correlation between predicted and measured nitrite values with R-C(2) = 0.9996, RMSEC = 4.7491 E-15, RMSECV = 0.0004, and MAPE = 0.68%. The method has been validated through an accuracy profile, which demonstrates that 80% of future results will fall within the 10% acceptability limit within the validation range of 1.30-8.83 mg/L.

AB Understanding the temporal dynamics of gene expression is crucial for developmental biology, tumour biology and biogerontology. However, some timepoints remain challenging to measure in the laboratory, particularly during very early or very late stages of a biological process. Here we propose Sagittarius, a transformer-based model that can accurately simulate gene expression profiles at timepoints outside the range of times measured in the laboratory. The key idea behind Sagittarius is to learn a shared reference space for time-series measurements, thereby explicitly modelling unaligned timepoints and conditional batch effects between time series, and making the model widely applicable to diverse biological settings. We show Sagittarius's promising performance when extrapolating mammalian developmental gene expression, simulating drug-induced expression at unmeasured dose and treatment times, and augmenting datasets to accurately predict drug sensitivity. We also used Sagittarius to extrapolate mutation profiles for early-stage cancer patients, which enabled us to discover a gene set connected to the Hedgehog signalling pathway that may be related to tumorigenesis in sarcoma patients, including PTCH1, ARID2 and MYCBP2. By augmenting experimental temporal datasets with crucial but difficult-to-measure extrapolated datapoints, Sagittarius enables deeper insights into the temporal dynamics of heterogeneous transcriptomic processes and can be broadly applied to biological time-series extrapolation.
   The temporal nature of the transcriptome is important for understanding many biological processes, but it is challenging to measure. By leveraging datasets with multiple time series, Woicik and colleagues present a model that accurately extrapolates genomic measurements to unmeasured timepoints, including developmental gene expression, drug-induced perturbations and cancer gene mutations.

ID MEMORY
AB Many advanced artificial intelligence tasks, such as policy optimization, decision making and autonomous navigation, demand high-bandwidth data transfer and probabilistic computing, posing great challenges for conventional computing hardware. Since digital computers based on the von Neumann architecture are good at precise and deterministic computing, their computing efficiency is limited by the high cost of both data transfer between memory and computing units and massive random number generation. Here we develop a stochastic computation-in-memory computing system that can efficiently perform both in situ random number generation and computation based on the nanoscale physical behaviour of memristors. This system is constructed based on a hardware-implemented multiple-memristor-array system. To demonstrate its functionality and efficiency, we implement a typical risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task, namely the storm coast task, with a four-layer Bayesian deep neural network. The computing system efficiently decomposes aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of memristor. Compared with the conventional digital computer, our memristor-based system achieves a 10 times higher speed and 150 times higher energy efficiency in uncertainty decomposition. This stochastic computation-in-memory computing system paves the way for high-speed and energy-efficient implementation of various probabilistic artificial intelligence algorithms.
   The stochastic features of memristors make them suitable for computation and probabilistic sampling; however, implementing these properties in hardware is extremely challenging. Lin et al. introduce an approach that leverages the cycle-to-cycle read variability of memristors as a physical random variable for in situ, real-time random number generation, and demonstrate it on a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning task.

TI Graph-based fine-grained model selection for multi-source domain

AB The prosperity of datasets and model architectures has led to the development of pretrained source models, which simplified the learning process in multi-domain transfer learning. However, challenges such as data complexity, domain shifts, and performance limitations make it difficult to determine which source model to transfer. To meet these challenges, source model selection has emerged as a promising approach for choosing the best model for a given target domain. Most literature utilizes transferability estimation combined with statistical methods to deduce the model selection probability, which is a coarse-grained method that selects a single model with limited accuracy and applicability in multi-source domains. To break through this limitation, we propose a graph-based fine-grained multi-source model selection method (GFMS) that aims to adaptively select the best source model for any single target domain data. Specifically, our proposed method comprises three main components: building a source model library through cross-training; generating the selection strategy by exploring the similarities among the data features, the associations between the features and models based on graph neural networks; blending the selected models using a weighted approach to obtain the best model adaptively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive method achieves higher accuracy in both model selection and image classification than the current state-of-the-art methods on compared datasets.

ID REGRESSION
AB Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a feedforward neural network that utilizes a single hidden layer to effectively tackle the learning speed challenges commonly associated with conventional gradient-based neural networks. ELM has been reported to achieve faster learning rates and better performance than traditional neural networks. However, it is susceptible to unreliable solutions when applied to real-world input data with inconsistent noise, resulting in overfitting. To mitigate these limitations, we investigate various regularization techniques that can be employed in conjunction with ELM, including Tikhonov regularization, a well-established method in the field. However, one of the main drawbacks of Tikhonov regularization is its assumption of the input data's noise to be white and Gaussian, which may not be the case in real-world applications. This assumption can lead to suboptimal regularization and poor generalization performance of the model. Therefore, we propose using an exponential filtering method in conjunction with ELM to overcome this limitation and improve the model's reliability. We compare our approach with Tikhonov regularization and other existing methods to evaluate its efficacy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed strategy achieves superior accuracy and generalization capability compared to the other methods. Moreover, we provide statistical evidence to support the significance of our findings.

AB Smart city applications have increasingly relied on the internet of things (IoT) and edge computing to enable data collection, processing, and communication across distributed networks. Owing to the widespread adoption of IoT and visual object tracking technologies in various domains, traditional visual object tracking techniques are no longer suitable for IoT applications. This paper discusses how image recognition and visual target tracking can be used to enhance track and field training based on IoT technology and reduce coach workload. The purpose of this project aimed to analyze athlete movements, develop customized training plans for track and field athletes, and improve the quality and efficiency of training for track and on-field athletes. This is accomplished by utilizing the edge computing to track moving targets for tracking and field training images. Matching points are extracted from the track and field training images and incorporated into the field-of-view border. Using an invariant projection method based on color information, it is possible to accurately track the movement of the target by analyzing its center position and the distance between field-of-view boundaries. Moreover, a moving target recognition technique based on neural networks is employed for image recognition, utilizing an error back-propagation algorithm to facilitate target recognition in track and field training images. The proposed method is demonstrated to be highly accurate and efficient, thereby reducing the workload of coaches, enabling detailed movement analysis of athletes, and increasing the effectiveness of track and field training. This algorithm has been demonstrated to be more effective than other methods in terms of tracking-effect diagrams and evaluation criteria based on experimental results. Using the proposed algorithm, the occlusion problem can be effectively solved while ensuring real-time tracking performance.

AB People around the globe are suffering from different types of brain-heart disorders. Early detection of these disorders may increase the lifespan of humans. Numerous inherited and non-hereditary central nervous system disorders (CNSDs) may have an effect on brain-heart diseases either directly or indirectly. However, the clinical predictions of these CNSDs are time-consuming. So, a computer-aided detection-based artificial intelligence model can be used to predict and classify CNSDs with high accuracy. This article is focused on the implementation of CNSD-Network (CNSD-Net) for joint brain-heart disorders identification through collective analysis of EEG and ECG signals to trace the problems related to epilepsy, stroke, Alzheimer's and sleep disorders. Initially, minimum mean-square-error short-time spectral amplitude is performed as a preprocessing operation, which removes different types of noise from the dataset. Then, disease-specific features and disease-dependent features are extracted using a transfer learning-based AlexNet model from the denoised signal. In addition, a nature-inspired remora optimization algorithm is used to extract the optimal features. In addition, a deep Q neural network is used to classify various central nervous system diseases from optimal trained features. The simulations proved that the proposed CNSD-Net resulted in superior performance when compared to conventional approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score.

AB Currently, E-commerce is widely adopted as it is important for business management and economic growth in the new global economy, and to reach the rapid increasing population. To better manage the e-commerce, it is important to collect and evaluate the consumer behavior data for decision making and optimization. The conventional computing technologies need high amount of power and time for large data analysis. Quantum computing has the potential to analyze the large amount of data more efficiently than classical computing. This paper aims to explore the core process areas that need to be considered by the practitioners for adopting quantum computing in social business. To address the objective of this study, we conducted a literature review and empirical study to explore the core process areas that need to be considered for the consideration of quantum computing in social business. The results show that limited scalability, regulatory challenges, high initial cost, limited availability of quantum resources, education, and training and security are the most important process areas that need to be focused by the industry practitioners. The result of this study gives a knowledge base for research and practitioners community to develop the tools and strategies for the adoption of quantum computing in social business.

ID FACIAL EXPRESSION
AB The diverse range of emotions exhibited in instructional behavior exerts a profound influence on the effectiveness of teaching and the cognitive state of learners. By leveraging an emotion recognition model, we can analyze the invaluable feedback information derived from teaching behavior data, thereby facilitating the enhancement of pedagogical effectiveness. However, conventional emotion recognition models fall short in capturing the intricate emotional features and subtle nuances inherent in teaching behavior, thereby hindering the accuracy of emotion classification. In light of this, we propose a groundbreaking multimodal emotion recognition model for teaching behavior, founded upon the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network (MSCNN). Our approach involves extracting both low-level and high-level local features from text, audio, and image modalities, utilizing LSTM and MSCNN, respectively. Subsequently, a transformer encoder is employed to fuse the extracted features, which are then fed into a fully connected layer for emotion recognition. Experimental results affirm that our proposed model attains an accuracy rate of 84.5% and an F1 score of 84.1% on a self-curated dataset, surpassing other comparative models. These outcomes unequivocally establish the efficacy and superiority of our emotion recognition model.

AB Chaotic systems have good characteristics, such as sensitivity to initial value and parameter, ergodicity, certainty and so on. Using chaos to generate pseudo-random sequences for encryption has good efficiency and security. However, due to the limitation of computing precision, the chaotic sequence running on the computer will enter a cycle after several times of iterations. In this paper, a control method is proposed to reduce this phenomenon. In this method, one chaotic map is used to adjust the parameters of another chaotic map, which makes the sequence generated by this model has good dynamic characteristics under a low computing precision. To prove the effectiveness of this model, two examples are provided. Furthermore, the dynamical performances of these two chaotic systems have been demonstrated by a series of analyses.

AB Human body skeleton, acting as a spatiotemporal graph, is the key inspiration for researchers to implement a GCN-based method for action recognition. Most recently proposed GCN-based techniques combine convolutions with a self-attention mechanism to extract the most informative joint of a human skeleton and increase the model accuracy. However, the traditional multi-head attention method absorbed all attention heads equally, whereas in most situations, especially for extended skeleton sequences, not all attention heads are expected. Therefore, we present a spatial-temporal gated graph attention network (ST-GGANet) to learn the spatial-temporal patterns of skeleton sequences. The proposed approach uses a lightweight self-attention-based gate layer to pay attention to the important body parts or joints of human skeleton sequences. Experiments show that by introducing an additional gate layer, which controls the significance of each attention head, the proposed model achieved better action classification results while keeping computational cost low. The proposed framework has been evaluated on well-known publicly available large-scale datasets NTU60, NTU120, and Kinetics-400, which notably outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with an accuracy of 96.5%, 87.3%, and 60.4%, respectively.

AB Supervised classification methods have been widely utilized for the quality assurance of the advanced manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing (AM) for anomaly (defects) detection. However, since abnormal states (with defects) occur much less frequently than normal ones (without defects) in a manufacturing process, the number of sensor data samples collected from a normal state is usually much more than that from an abnormal state. This issue causes imbalanced training data for classification analysis, thus deteriorating the performance of detecting abnormal states in the process. It is beneficial to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal states to make a more balanced training set. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) using additive manufacturing process image sensor data. The novelty of our approach is that a standard GAN and classifier are jointly optimized with techniques to stabilize the learning process of standard GAN. The diverse and high-quality generated samples provide balanced training data to the classifier. The iterative optimization between GAN and classifier provides the high-performance classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by both open-source data and real-world case studies in polymer and metal AM processes.

AB Risk is essentially uncertain, including objective uncertainty of natural attributes and subjective uncertainty of human cognition. The latter is associated with human cognitive thinking and social consciousness, making it challenging to quantify and articulate. Therefore, appropriately managing cognitive uncertainty is essential to achieve successful risk management. In situations involving political environments, decision-makers may rely on judgment or other qualitative information, which can be less reliable or more subjective. Therefore, using cognitive computing methods can provide significant benefits in quantifying and managing cognitive uncertainty. We propose a novel approach that utilizes a probabilistic linguistic quantification method for qualitative evaluation information. This method accounts for both the cognitive uncertainty and statistical uncertainty of decision-makers. To quantify the practical cognitive risk context in the risk evaluation, we propose a new probabilistic linguistic distance measure that quantifies the influence of experts' subjective preference context in the risk environment. Furthermore, to represent both the risk-averse attitudes and the cognitive uncertainty context of the decision-makers, we propose an improved version of the prospect theory, which considers. This enables a more accurate representation of the practical cognitive decision-making processes. Subsequently, we construct a cognitive uncertainty evaluation model based on the probabilistic linguistic measurement and apply it to comprehensive risk assessment for geopolitical environments. Analysis of the risk assessment outcomes and comparative experiments indicate that the proposed methods can quantitatively assess and calculate decision-makers' cognitive risk preferences while providing more accurate risk assessment outcomes. This study offers a novel and convenient tool to research risk evaluations focused on cognitive uncertainties.

AB The field of electroencephalography (EEG) has made significant contributions to our understanding of the brain, our understanding of neurological diseases, and our ability to treat such diseases. Epileptic seizures, strokes, and even death can all be detected with the use of the electroencephalogram, a diagnostic technique used to record electrical activity in the brain. This research suggests using binary classification for automated epilepsy diagnosis. Patients' EEG signals are pre-processed after being recorded. On the basis of the results of the feature extraction technique, the best traits are picked for further examination by means of a structured genetic algorithm. The EEG data are analysed and categorized as either seizure-free or epileptic seizure-related based on the assumption of feature optimization utilizing the support vector classifier. As a result, categorizing EEG signals is an ideal application for the suggested technique. For this purpose of accelerating the implementation of distributed computing, a CEHOC (Chaotic Elephant Herding Optimization based Classification) is used to classify the vast scope of various datasets. The results show that the CEHOC algorithm is more effective than previous versions. Precision, recall, F score, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are some of the metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the work provided here. The suggested work has a 99.3019% accuracy rate, a 98.2018% sensitivity rate, and a 99.1125% specificity rate. There was an F score of 99.3204%, a precision of 99.1019%, and a recall of 98.3015%. These numbers indicate that the planned action was successful.

AB Chemists have been pursuing general mathematical laws to explain and predict molecular properties for a long time. However, most of the traditional quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models have limited application domains; for example, they tend to have poor generalization performance when applied to molecules with parent structures different from those of the trained molecules. This paper attempts to develop a new QSAR method that is theoretically possible to predict various properties of molecules with diverse structures. The proposed deep electron cloud-activity relationships (DECAR) and deep field-activity relationships (DFAR) methods consist of three essentials: (1) a large number of molecule entities with activity data as training objects and responses; (2) three-dimensional electron cloud density (ECD) or related field data by the accurate density functional theory methods as input descriptors; and (3) a deep learning model that is sufficiently flexible and powerful to learn the large data described above. DECAR and DFAR are used to distinguish 977 sweet and 1965 non-sweet molecules (with 6-fold data augmentation), and the classification performance is demonstrated to be significantly better than the traditional least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) models using traditional descriptors. DECAR and DFAR would provide a possible way to establish a widely applicable, cumulative, and shareable artificial intelligence-driven QSAR system. They are likely to promote the development of an interactive platform to collect and share the accurate ECD and field data of millions of molecules with annotated activities. With enough input data, we envision the appearance of several deep networks trained for various molecular activities. Finally, we could anticipate a single DECAR or DFAR network to learn and infer various properties of interest for chemical molecules, which will become an open and shared learning and inference tool for chemists.

AB A comprehensive analysis of an automated system for epileptic seizure detection is explained in this work. When a seizure occurs, it is quite difficult to differentiate the non-stationary patterns from the discharges occurring in a rhythmic manner. The proposed approach deals with it efficiently by clustering it initially for the sake of feature extraction by using six different techniques categorized under two different methods, e.g., bio-inspired clustering and learning-based clustering. Learning-based clustering includes K-means clusters and Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clusters, while bio-inspired clusters include Cuckoo search clusters, Dragonfly clusters, Firefly clusters, and Modified Firefly clusters. Clustered values were then classified with 10 suitable classifiers, and after the performance comparison analysis of the EEG time series, the results proved that this methodology flow achieved a good performance index and a high classification accuracy. A comparatively higher classification accuracy of 99.48% was achieved when Cuckoo search clusters were utilized with linear support vector machines (SVM) for epilepsy detection. A high classification accuracy of 98.96% was obtained when K-means clusters were classified with a naive Bayesian classifier (NBC) and Linear SVM, and similar results were obtained when FCM clusters were classified with Decision Trees yielding the same values. The comparatively lowest classification accuracy, at 75.5%, was obtained when Dragonfly clusters were classified with the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier, and the second lowest classification accuracy of 75.75% was obtained when Firefly clusters were classified with NBC.

DE Graph neural networks; Siamese edge -drop; Over-smoothing
AB In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the most widely used techniques for irregular data analysis. The core of GNNs lies in feature and/or label smoothing, which endows GNNs with promising expressive power. However, over-smoothing by excessive convolution on graph will inevitably result in performance degradation. While DropEdge has been shown to be an effective approach to tackle this problem, it views the over-smoothing as a macroscopic phenomenon and treats all edges equally. By tapping into the smoothness at a microscopic level, it is found that the smoothing processes in different regions are diverse. In particular, the first sign of over-smoothing generally emerges among connected hubs (i.e., nodes with high degrees). With this insight, we propose a novel edge dropout method to retrain early over-smoothing in graph learning, so as to relieve the global over-smoothing. Moreover, we introduce the siamese network architecture to alleviate the inconsistency problem inherent in Edge dropout methods (e.g. DropEdge). Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that the proposed method consistently leads to improved performance and significantly outperforms the standard DropEdge with enhanced robustness.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB User preference mining is one of the most crucial activities in the conceptual design process, aiming to gain customer attentions at the early design stage. Since user preference is usually ambiguous, existing methods of preference extraction and assessment strongly rely on design experience and hard to analyze the implicit design preferences at semantic level. In addition, the abstraction of the knowledge representation prevents a reasonable judgment of the scheme's potential value. To fill these gaps, by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) technology and semantic network, an integrated implicit design preference (DP) mining approach is proposed to support the uncertain conceptual design decision-making. The proposed approach has three parts: first, the design knowledge semantic network (DKSN) is constructed by using NLP and patent data, which provides a new retrieval mode for function solving; second, TF-IDF model is introduced to extract the DPs, a similarity matrix between the principle solution (PS) retrieved from DKSN and design characteristic (DC) is constructed using word vector model, which can mine the potential satisfaction of various DPs in each PS; and third, based on the satisfaction matrix of PSs, a normalized comprehensive value matrix of the schemes is constructed, and the optimal scheme is obtained using rough VIKOR (VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje). A case study of pipeline inspection trolley design is used to validate the proposed approach, sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed model truly captures the scheme's intention. Additionally, the constructed DKSN has positive implications for assisting designers in exploring the design space.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The next release problem (NRP) refers to implementing the next release of software in the software industry regarding the expected revenues; specifically, constraints like limited budgets indicate that the total cost corresponding to the next software release should be minimized. This paper uses and investigates the comparative performance of nineteen state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms, including NSGA-II, rNSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOEAD, EFRRR, tDEA, KnEA, MOMBIII, SPEA2, RVEA, NNIA, HypE, ANSGA-III, BiGE, GrEA, IDBEA, SPEAR, SPEA2SDE, and MOPSO, that can tackle this problem. The problem was designed to maximize customer satisfaction and minimize the total required cost. Three indicators, namely hyper-volume (HV), spread, and runtime, were examined to compare the algorithms. Two types of datasets, i.e., classic and realistic data, from small to large scale, were also examined to verify the applicability of the results. Overall, NSGA-II exhibited the best CPU run time in all test scales, and, also, the results show that the HV and spread values of 1st and 2nd best algorithms (NNIA and SPEAR), for which most HV values for NNIA are bigger than 0.708 and smaller than 1, while the HV values for SPEAR vary between 0.706 and 0.708.

AB In this study, we propose an error-feedback method (EFM) for constraint handling of the path generation problem, which replaces the traditional penalty-functional method. Moreover, it proportionally redistributes solutions that do not satisfy the constraint conditions, such that each offspring can effectively participate in the iterative process and avoid additional computing resource wastage. To test the performance, the EFM, penalty, and self-adaptive-penalty-functional methods were applied to heuristic algorithms, such as the differential evolution (DE), teaching learning-based optimisation (TLBO), whale optimisation algorithm (WOA), and gaining-sharing knowledge (GSK). Three four-bar mechanisms of dimensional synthesis and one path-generation problem of a pickup manipulator was considered as examples. The numerical results showed that the algorithm processed by the new constraint-processing method exhibited improved performance compared to other methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent developments in attributed network clustering combine graph neural networks and autoencoders for unsupervised learning. Although effective, these techniques suffer from either (a) clustering-unfriendly embedding spaces or (b) limited utilization of attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called Variational Co-embedding Learning Model for Attributed Network Clustering (VCLANC), which utilizes much deeper information from the network by reconstructing both the network structure and the node attributes to perform self-supervised learning. Technically, VCLANC consists of dual variational autoencoders that co-embed nodes and attributes into the same latent space, along with a trainable Gaussian mixture prior that simultaneously performs representation learning and node clustering. To optimize the variational autoencoders and infer the latent variables of embeddings and clustering assignments, we derive a new variational lower bound that maximizes the joint likelihood of the observed network structure and node attributes. Furthermore, we also adopt a mutual distance loss on the cluster centers and a clustering assignment hardening loss on the node embeddings to strengthen clustering quality. Our experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of VCLANC for attributed network clustering.

DE Long-term ECG; Multimodal learning; Multi-instance learning; Attention

ID HEARTBEAT CLASSIFICATION; CNN
AB Recently, deep learning-based models have been widely used for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification tasks. Most ECG signals are long-term time series that contain a large number of sample points. However, existing deep learning-based models resize or crop the original long-term ECG signal due to the limitation of input size and hardware, which results in information loss. To address this issue, a multimodal multi-instance learning neural network (MAMIL) is proposed for long-term ECG classification. The proposed MAMIL has three major components. First, the original ECG signal and Gramian Angular Field (GAF) image converted from the ECG signal are utilized as multimodal inputs, which enables the model to learn complementary information between different modalities. Second, multi-instance learning (MIL) is introduced to avoid information loss. Each long-term ECG signal and GAF image are treated as bags, and each heartbeat from a long-term ECG signal and each patch from a GAF image are treated as instances. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized to extract instance features from different modalities. Third, a novel attention mechanism-based feature fusion method is proposed to aggregate the instance features from multiple modalities to obtain the bag feature for final classification. Our feature fusion method adopts pooling to obtain positive instances, which can effectively eliminate redundant information and achieve low computational complexity. The proposed MAMIL is evaluated on both intrapatient and interpatient patterns of two commonly used ECG datasets. Experimental results show that our model not only outperforms common deep learning-based models, but also outperforms previous MIL-based models. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Federated learning is a very convenient approach for scenarios where (i) the exchange of data implies privacy concerns and/or (ii) a quick reaction is needed. In smart healthcare systems, both aspects are usually required. In this paper, we work on the first scenario, where preserving privacy is key and, consequently, building a unique and massive medical image data set by fusing different data sets from different medical institutions or research centers (computation nodes) is not an option. We propose an ensemble federated learning (EFL) approach that is based on the following characteristics: First, each computation node works with a different data set (but of the same type). They work locally and apply an ensemble approach combining eight well-known CNN models (densenet169, mobilenetv2, xception, inceptionv3, vgg16, resnet50, densenet121, and resnet152v2) on Chest X-ray images. Second, the best two local models are used to create a local ensemble model that is shared with a central node. Third, the ensemble models are aggregated to obtain a global model, which is shared with the computation nodes to continue with a new iteration. This procedure continues until there are no changes in the best local models. We have performed different experiments to compare our approach with centralized ones (with or without an ensemble approach). The results conclude that our proposal outperforms these ones in Chest X-ray images (achieving an accuracy of 96.63%) and offers very competitive results compared to other proposals in the literature.

AB Pavement management systems (PMS) were typically developed to manage interurban networks. This paper presents an urban pavement management system (UM-PMS) that integrates all the modules of a PMS considering the particularities of the urban context. The tool uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to import, analyze, and manage the data of the urban road network. The inspection data is obtained by an automatic equipment composed by a video camera installed on a vehicle. Images are analyzed by deep learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Further, appropriate decisions on maintenance treatments are made by integrating multi-objective optimization and multi-criteria decision-making methods to plan efficient maintenance strategies considering economic, environmental, social, and performance objectives. Finally, the tool is applied to an urban case study to illustrate its applicability. Outcomes indicate that the proposed framework can obtain a sustainable short-term plan without losing sight of the long-term efficiency.

AB Neural architecture search (NAS) attracts much research attention, contributing to its ability to identify better architectures than manually-designed ones. Recently, differential neural architecture search meth-ods have been widely used due to their impressive effectiveness and performance. They represent the network architecture as a repetitive proxy-directed acyclic graph (DAG) and optimize the network weights and architecture weights alternatively in a differential manner. However, existing methods model the ar-chitecture weights on each edge (i.e., a layer in the network) as statistically independent variables, ig-noring the dependency between edges in DAG induced by their directed topological connections. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate such a dependency or relationship by proposing a novel inter-layer transition NAS method. It casts the architecture optimization into a sequential decision pro-cess where the dependency between the architecture weights of connected edges is explicitly modeled. Specifically, edges are divided into inner and outer groups according to whether or not their predecessor edges are in the same cell. While the architecture weights of outer edges are optimized independently, those of inner edges are derived sequentially based on the architecture weights of their predecessor edges and the learnable transition matrices in an attentive probability transition manner. Experiments on five benchmark classification datasets, four searching spaces, and NAS-Bench-201 confirm the value of mod-eling inter-layer dependency and demonstrate the proposed method outperforms other methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Pre-trained language model; Zero-shot text classification; Prompt-based
   learning
AB Starting from the resurgence of deep learning, language models (LMs) have never been so popular. Through simply increasing model scale and data size, large LMs pre-trained with self-supervision objectives demonstrate awe-inspiring results on both task performance and generalization. At the early stage, supervised fine-tuning is indispensable in adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) to downstream tasks. Later on, the sustained growth of model capacity and data size, as well as newly presented pre-training techniques, make the PLMs perform well under the few-shot setting, especially in the recent paradigm of prompt-based learning. After witnessing the success of PLMs for few-shot tasks, we propose to further study the potential and limitations of PLMs for the zero-shot setting. We utilize 3 models from the most popular BERT family to launch the empirical study on 20 different datasets. We are surprised to find that some simple strategies (without the need of human efforts or unsupervised data) can yield very promising results on a few widely-used datasets, e.g., 88.34%(& PLUSMN;0.60) accuracy on the IMDB dataset, and 84.88%(& PLUSMN;2.83) accuracy on the Amazon dataset, which outperforms manually created prompts without engineering in achieving much better and stable performance with the accuracy of 74.06%(& PLUSMN;13.04), 75.54%(& PLUSMN;11.77) for comparison. However, we also observe some limitations of PLMs under the zero-shot setting, particularly for the language understanding tasks (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE).2 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The advent of COVID-19 put much economic pressure on countries worldwide, especially low-income countries. Providing test kits for Covid-19 posed a huge challenge at the beginning of the pandemic. Especially the low-income and less developed countries that did not have the technology to produce this kit and had to import it into the country, which itself cost a lot to buy and distribute these kits. This paper proposes a sustainable COVID-19 test kits supply chain network (STKSCN) for the first time to fill this gap. Distribution and transportation of test kits, location of distribution centers, and management of used test kits are considered in this network. A mixed integer linear programming Multi-Objective (MO), multi-period, multi-resource mathematical model is extended for the proposed supply chain. Another contribution is designing a platform based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to increase the speed, accuracy and security of the network. In this way, patients set their appointment online by registering their personal details and clinical symptoms. An augmented ������-constraint2 (AUGMECON2) is proposed for solving small and medium size of problem. Also, two meta-heuristic algorithms, namely NSGA-II and PESA-II are presented to solve the small, medium and large size of the problem. Taguchi method is utilized to control the parameters, and for comparison between meta-heuristic, five performance metrics are suggested. In addition, a case study in Iran is presented to validate the proposed model. Finally, the results show that PESA-II is more efficient and has better performance than the others based on assessment metrics and computational time.

AB Predicting human eye movements is a crucial task for understanding human behavior and has numerous applications in machine vision. Most current models for predicting eye movements are data-driven and require large datasets of recorded eye movements, which can be expensive and time-consuming to col-lect. In this paper, we present a novel theory-based model for predicting eye movements in a foveated visual system that maximizes information gain at each fixation. Our model uses a region-proposal net-work and eccentricity-based max pooling to account for the loss of detail in peripheral vision. We apply our model to predict human fixations in a visual search task for objects in real-world scenes. Unlike data-driven models, our model does not require training on large eye movement datasets and can generalize to any set of natural images and targets. We evaluate the generalization capability of our model by demon-strating its results on two publicly available visual search datasets, Ehinger and COCO-search18, without any further training on those datasets. Our model outperforms or performs comparably to data-driven models that are directly trained on human eye movement datasets. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Persuasion dialogues in multi-agent systems are required in situations in which agents debate to defend their viewpoint on a certain topic. In this work, we introduce a dialogue system for persuasion dialogues in which participants can exchange and complete enthymemes using structured argumentation as the underlying knowledge representation formalism. In our approach, the dialogue system provides the means to create arguments from enthymemes by generating assumptions based solely on the enthymeme's structure. Then, arguments are used to determine the dialectical status of the dialogue. We prove that under minimal restrictions, agents involved in a persuasion dialogue can reach an agreement successfully, and they can acquire knowledge such that their mental model is consistent with the outcome of the dialogue.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ID INFLUENCE-COEFFICIENT CONTROL
AB Vibration in rotating machinery is one of the main causes of machine failure. Active and passive control methods have been developed in order to reduce vibration levels and extend the operating speeds of machines. These controllers are either manually tuned or tuned during operation using adaptive control techniques and are tailored to a single vibration source. In the field of artificial intelligence, deep reinforcement learning has greatly impacted the field of continuous control, from mastering simple games to controlling multiple actuators in a robot doing complex tasks. Deep reinforcement learning agents are capable of finding optimal control policies without a model of the underlying system. This work proposes the multi-actor-critic deep deterministic policy gradient (MAC-DDPG) algorithm by integrating multiple criteria to train concurrent actors in a periodic system. Using the frequency footprint of each type of vibration, a cost function is designed to train the critics and actors. The proposed controller is evaluated on a test rig supported by two patented Smart Electro-Magnetic Actuator Journal Integrated Bearings (SEMAJIB). The proposed controller is capable of finding optimal control policies for reducing the synchronous vibration caused by the rotor's unbalance and stabilizing a system with oil whip vibration. A derivative controller actor and a harmonic actor are used concurrently for controlling the vibrations. The proposed controller is able to reach unbalance vibration reduction up to 93%. In addition, the proposed controller is successful in completely eliminating oil whip instability with up to 99% reduction.

AB Smart energy performance monitoring and optimisation at the supplier and consumer levels is essential to realising smart cities. In order to implement a more sustainable energy management plan, it is crucial to conduct a better energy forecast. The next-generation smart meters can also be used to measure, record, and report energy consumption data, which can be used to train machine learning (ML) models for predicting energy needs. However, sharing energy consumption information to perform centralised learning may compromise data privacy and make it vulnerable to misuse, in addition to incurring high transmission overhead on communication resources. This study addresses these issues by utilising federated learning (FL), an emerging technique that performs ML model training at the user/substation level, where data resides. We introduce FedraTrees, a new, lightweight FL framework that benefits from the outstanding features of ensemble learning. Furthermore, we developed a delta-based FL stopping algorithm to monitor FL training and stop it when it does not need to continue. The simulation results demonstrate that FedraTrees outperforms the most popular federated averaging (FedAvg) framework and the baseline Persistence model for providing accurate energy forecasting patterns while taking only 2% of the computation time and 13% of the communication rounds compared to FedAvg, saving considerable amounts of computation and communication resources.

AB The interpretability of an intelligent model automatically derived from data is a property that can be acted upon with a set of structural constraints that such a model should adhere to. Often these are in contrast with the task objective and it is not straightforward how to explore the balance between model interpretability and performance. In order to allow an interested user to jointly optimise performance and interpretability, we propose a new formulation of Neural Additive Models (NAM) which can be subject to a number of constraints. Accordingly, our approach produces a new model that is called Constrainable NAM (or just CNAM in short) and it allows the specification of different regularisation terms. CNAM is differentiable and is built in such a way that it can be initialised as a solution of an efficient tree-based GAM solver (e.g., Explainable Boosting Machines). From this local optimum the model can then explore solutions with different interpretability-performance tradeoffs according to different definitions of both interpretability and performance. We empirically benchmark the model on 56 datasets against 12 models and observe that on average the proposed CNAM model ranks on the Pareto front of optimal solutions, i.e., models generated by CNAM exhibit a good balance between interpretability and performance. Moreover, we provide two illustrative examples which are aimed to show step by step how CNAM works well for solving classification tasks, but also how it can yield insights when considering regression tasks.

AB An uncertainty compiler is a tool that automatically translates original computer source code lacking explicit uncertainty quantification into code containing appropriate uncertainty representations and uncertainty propagation algorithms. It handles the specifications of input uncertainties, and inserts calls to intrusive uncertainty quantification algorithms. In theory, one could create an uncertainty compiler for any scientific programming language. The uncertainty compiler can apply intrusive uncertainty propagation methods to codes or parts of codes and, therefore, more comprehensively and flexibly address epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. This paper explores the concept and the practicalities of creating such a compiler.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Multi-fidelity information fusion has attracted increasing attention in the recent for its promising in engineering design and optimization. However, most of the existing fusion methods are sensitive to the correlation between low-fidelity (LF) and high-fidelity (HF) information, which could be further improved in terms of approximation performance. To address this problem, we develop a feature mapping-based hierarchical surrogate model for the fusion of LF and HF information. Compared to most current models, the presented model has a distinct hierarchical structure, where the LF model is first built through radial basis function. Then, a mapping relationship is established to describe the correlation between the transitional prediction and the HF prediction, and the mapping relationship is optimized using the Rayleigh quotient. Finally, a surrogate model is developed that can fuse information with different fidelities. To verify the effectiveness of the developed model, widely used numerical problems are analyzed, and five state-of-the-art methods are selected as comparative surrogates. Moreover, one engineering case is investigated to illustrate the capability of the proposed model in support of complex engineering design. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods in 97.436% of the thirteen test problems under three different quantitative evaluations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID NETWORK
AB The emerging topic of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has attracted increasing attention and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in many recommendation problems, due to its strong ability in node representation with exploring high-order information. To learn a node's representation, previous meth-ods usually linearly combine the embeddings of node features, amusing the equal importance of neigh-bors. However, due to the intrinsic differences (i.e., degree, create time) over neighbors, we argue that these differences carry important signals for node representation. Ignoring them will lead to a suboptimal in node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up graph-based operations. To address it, we propose BIG-SAGE@ for item recommendation with rating prediction task, which is a neighbor importance-aware graph neural network. Specifically, its main idea is twofold: 1) A rating confidence-based neighborhood sampling method is introduced, making the sampling process biased to those more valuable nodes. 2) An attention network is integrated to achieve the rating prediction task, by flexibly incorporating information from user and item embedding features. Finally, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed model on six public data sets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BIG-SAGE@ in the rating prediction and TopN ranking tasks, compared to the SOTA methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most deep learning approaches for image quality assessment use regression from deep features extracted by CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks). However, non-local information is usually neglected in exist-ing methods. Motivated by the recent success of transformers in modeling contextual information, we propose a hybrid framework that utilizes a vision transformer backbone to extract features and a CNN decoder for quality estimation. We propose a shared feature extraction scheme for both FR and NR set-tings. A two-branch structured attentive quality predictor is devised for quality prediction. Evaluation experiments on various IQA datasets, including LIVE, CSIQ and TID2013, LIVE-Challenge, KADID-10 K, and KONIQ-10 K, show that our proposed models achieve outstanding performance for both FR and NR settings.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses challenges to their reliability and security. However, current adversarial robust-ness (AR) measures lack a theoretical foundation, limiting the insight into the decision process. To address this issue, we propose a new AR evaluation framework based on Graph of Patterns (GoPs) models and graph distance algorithms. Our approach provides a fine-grained analysis of AR from three perspectives, providing targeted insight into the vulnerability of CNNs. Compared to current standards, our approach is theoretically grounded and allows fine-tuning of model components without repeated attempts and validation. Our experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in uncovering hidden vulnerabilities in CNNs and providing actionable approaches to improve their AR. Our GoPs modeling approach and graph distance algorithms can be extended to apply to other graph machine learning tasks such as Metric Learn-ing on multi-relational graphs. Overall, our framework represents significant progress in AR evaluation, providing a more interpretable, targeted, and efficient approach to assess CNN robustness in complex graph-based systems. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Entropy estimation is of practical importance in information theory and statistical science. Many existing entropy estimators suffer from fast growing estimation bias with respect to dimensionality, rendering them unsuitable for high-dimensional problems. In this work we propose a transform-based method for high-dimensional entropy estimation, which consists of the following two main ingredients. Firstly, we provide a modified k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) entropy estimator that can reduce estimation bias for samples closely resembling a uniform distribution. Second we design a normalizing flow based mapping that pushes samples toward the uniform distribution, and the relation between the entropy of the original samples and the transformed ones is also derived. As a result the entropy of a given set of samples is estimated by first transforming them toward the uniform distribution and then applying the proposed estimator to the transformed samples. The performance of the proposed method is compared against several existing entropy estimators, with both mathematical examples and real-world applications. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Remote heart rate estimation aims to predict cardiac activity signals from facial videos without any physical contact, which has been showing promising results recently. However, existing estimation methods based on deep convolutional networks only focus on the rigid receptive field, while ignoring potential spatial correlations of different facial regions, which obviously cannot reduce the overfitting caused by various noise and motion interference unrelated to cardiac activity. To address these issues, this paper proposes PhysGCN, an end-to-end spatiotemporal graph convolutional network with the hyperbolic embedding, to coordinate the contributions of intra-and inter-frame features of facial videos for long-term heart rate estimation. Specifically, firstly, we convert the facial video captured by the vision system into a graph-structure spatiotemporal map, and use the link set of the graph to determine and lock the spatial relative positions of multiple skin sub-regions formed by intra-frame face segmentation and projection. Secondly, to purify the signal and prevent the interference from heart rate irrelevant features, we integrate and measure the similarity between sub-regions within the graph in a non-Euclidean space by a hyperbolic embedding module, which can characterize the correlation more distinctly compared to the plane space. Finally, we dynamically and elaborately orchestrate the inherent temporal and learned spatial features in a graph convolutional module to obtain reliable heart rate waveforms. We conduct extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies on multiple public datasets to verify the superiority and robustness of our method. Experiments show that our method can effectively estimate heart rate from facial videos, and its performance surpasses or matches the state-of-the-art methods.

AB High throughput nuclear segmentation and classification of whole slide images (WSIs) is crucial to biological analysis, clinical diagnosis and precision medicine. With the advances of CNN algorithms and the continuously growing datasets, considerable progress has been made in nuclear segmentation and classification. However, few works consider how to reasonably deal with nuclear heterogeneity in the following two aspects: imbalanced data distribution and diversified morphology characteristics. The minority classes might be dominated by the majority classes due to the imbalanced data distribution and the diversified morphology characteristics may lead to fragile segmentation results. In this study, a cost -Sensitive MultI-task LEarning (SMILE) framework is conducted to tackle the data heterogeneity problem. Based on the most popular multi-task learning backbone in nuclei segmentation and classification, we propose a multi-task correlation attention (MTCA) to perform feature interaction of multiple high relevant tasks to learn better feature representation. A cost-sensitive learning strategy is proposed to solve the imbalanced data distribution by increasing the penalization for the error classification of the minority classes. Furthermore, we propose a novel post-processing step based on the coarse-to-fine marker-controlled watershed scheme to alleviate fragile segmentation when nuclei are with large size and unclear contour. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on CoNSeP and MoNuSAC 2020 datasets.

AB Appropriate representations are critical for a better clustering performance. Although many neural network-based clustering methods have been proposed, they do not directly train neural networks to improve the clustering performance. We propose a method that can meta-learn knowledge for clustering from various labeled data and uses the knowledge for clustering unseen unlabeled data. The proposed method trains neural networks to obtain representations such that the clustering performance improves when the representations are clustered by variational Bayesian (VB) inference with an infinite Gaussian mixture model. For the objective function, we propose a continuous approximation of the adjusted Rand index (ARI) by which we can evaluate the clustering performance from soft clustering assignments. Since the approximated ARI and the VB inference procedure are differentiable, we can backpropagate the objec-tive function through the VB inference procedure to train the neural networks. With experiments using text and image datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method has a higher adjusted Rand index than the existing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inspired by the vision of fully autonomous airside operations at Schiphol airport, this study aims to contribute to the short-term goal of automated aircraft ground handling. In this research, we design and evaluate a multi-agent system for planning of automated ground handling. There are two main components in the system: task allocation optimization and multi-agent path planning. To allocate tasks to ground support equipment (GSE) vehicles, an auction mechanism inspired by temporal sequential single item (TeSSI) auction is proposed. Ground handling tasks scheduling for GSE vehicles is modeled as several single-vehicle pickup and delivery optimization problems (SPDP), and the values of the objective functions are used to generate bids for GSE vehicle agents in the auction. Prioritized safe interval path planning for large agents (LA-SIPP) is used to plan collision-free paths for GSE vehicle agents in the model to execute tasks. The aim is to increase the success rates of allocating tasks and finding collision free paths without causing flight delays, given the limited resources such as a small number of available GSE vehicles, time windows constraints and conflicting interests of different agents. Due to the results, even for the instances with frequent flights and the most limited resources, the success rates of allocation and path planning were higher than 81% and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, periodic task allocation and path planning of the ground handling tasks for flights in three aircraft stands during a planning time window of the day, as well as replanning in case of disruptions were performed in a short CPU time. There is a lack of research dealing with the complete process of ground handling, since existing studies concerning the automation of ground handling operations involve fleet assignment or task scheduling models without an integration of detailed path planning. Our main contribution is to present a framework that combines task allocation and path planning for automation of ground handling operations and provides solutions using a multi-agent perspective. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB In this paper, we address the problem of real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance for automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in dynamic environments, which is a primary research area in collaborative control systems for AGVs. To overcome the computational inefficiency of recalculating optimal paths every time, we propose an improved Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)-based reinforcement learning methodology. This methodology utilizes a novel composite auxiliary reward structure and sum-tree prioritized experience replay (SAC-SP) to achieve real-time optimal feedback control. First, we formulate the navigation task as a Markov Decision Process that considers both static and dynamic obstacles. To accelerate the active learning of AGVs, we propose a novel strategy that uses composite auxiliary rewards. Next, we train the AGVs using the proposed SAC-SP methodology to handle real-time navigation with the composite auxiliary reward structure. The well-trained policy network can generate effective on-board optimal feedback actions given obstacle positions, targets, and AGV states. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can steer AGVs to the destination with high robustness to original conditions and various obstacle restrictions, generating optimal feedback actions in the shortest amount of time.

AB We present the first systematic work on Military High-level Camouflage object Detection (MHCD), aiming to identify objects visibly embedded in chaotic backgrounds. The high intrinsic similarities (e.g., texture, intensity, color, etc.) between the attention object and its background give the task far more challenging than general object detection. In this paper, we construct a benchmark MHCD2022 dataset, which con-sists of 3000 images with dense annotations covering 5 categories from multiple real-world scenes. Remarkably, based on the observation that biological vision usually first obtains perception from global search and strives to recover the complete object, we propose a novel Military High-level detection Network, called MHNet, which is characterized by four ingenious modules: Subject Perception Gathering (SPG), Part-object Relationships Mining (PRM), Concept Recovery/Feature Clue Supplement (CR/FCS) and Springboard Selection (SS). Firstly, a SPG is designed for global foreground rough perception by the exploitation of depth information. Second, a PRM is particularly used to mine part-object potential relations in diverse environments. After that, we propose CR/FCS and SS to enhance the destroyed instance-level representation and suppress the domain imbalance problem, respectively. Extensive experimental results show that previous methods suffered from poor performance, MHNet significantly outperforms camouflage baselines and competing methods on the MHCD2022 for the high-level camou-flaged object. Finally, we also present and highlight the practical application value and several future directions of the research. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multivariate calibration models are one of the most predominant tools in analytical chemistry for the non-destructive quantification of constituents. While pipelines, methods, and software are widely available for training calibration models, the monitoring strategies to track the prediction performance in time are still limited and are one of the emerging research topics in chemometrics and machine learning. Moreover, for the sake of efficiency, the development of modern monitoring strategies requires tools that do not require new reference values at each time point. The current study addresses the problem of monitoring calibration models for regression. We present a monitoring paradigm and propose two methods to monitor the performance of the model. The two methods focus on bias drift and spectral variation drift. We present the derivation of the methods and their application to two real case studies from the agrofood industry involving milk composition and apple harvesting. Conclusions and recommendations are presented for practitioners, as well as views for future work in this domain of research.

DE Ensemble learning; Self-supervised learning; Unsupervised domain
   adaptation; Image translations
AB Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to improve the generalization capacity of models when they are tested on a real-world target domain by learning a model on a source labeled domain. Recently, a UDA method was proposed that addresses the adaptation problem by combining ensemble learning with self-supervised learning. However, this method uses only the source domain to pretrain the model and employs a limited amount of classifiers to create target pseudo labels. To mitigate these deficiencies, in this work, we explore the usage of image translations in combination with ensemble learning and self-supervised learning. To increase the model's exposure to more variable pretraining data, our method creates multiple diverse image translations, which encourages the learning of domain-invariant features, desired to increase generalization. With these image translations, we are able to learn translation-specific classifiers, which also allows to maximize the amount of ensemble's classifiers resulting in more robust target pseudo labels. In addition, we propose to use the target domain in pretraining stage to mitigate source domain bias in the network. We evaluate our method on the standard UDA benchmarks, i.e., adapting GTA V and Synthia to Cityscapes, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the mIoU metric. Extensive ablation experiments are reported to highlight the advantageous properties of our UDA strategy.

ID MORTALITY; INDIA
AB Maternal health is a significant public health concern for globe and many developing countries. A country like India (with large population), there are considerable disparities in maternal health service utilisation and maternal mortality within and across states. A more than a general healthcare operational policy would suffice, but a precision healthcare strategy would be needed. This article focused on explainable machine learning models that can precisely advise health care intervention policy and medical treatment to an administrative unit rather than a generic policy suggestion for improving maternal health. This study presents an exhaustive list of factors associated with Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) and a series of explainable AI models. One of models uses CART heuristics to categorise districts (administrative boundaries) into lower and higher MMR classes. Another explainable model, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), used SVM, ANN, boosting, and random forest machine learning models to investigate higher and lower MMR regions. Further, an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) also used, and the results are compared for policy suggestions. Some of the ignored features from general social science studies, such as topography and agro-climatic zone characteristics of a particular district, may be crucial in the analysis. Moreover, health infrastructure, insurance, and other factors also influence policymaking. This predictive and explainable work has significant implications for precision healthcare policy design to improve maternal health compared to a broader policy approach.

AB Aspect sentiment classification tasks aim to identify the aspect in a sentence and express the sentiment polarities of the aspect. In existing studies, combining different deep learning models has achieved good results in aspectual sentiment classification tasks; however, problems such as complex syntactic parsing relationships, insensitivity to syntactic structure information and lack of exploitation of external sentiment knowledge. We propose a graph attention network (SSK-GAT) model incorporating syntactic, semantic and knowledge that considers reshaped syntactic dependencies, multi-head selfattention to capture semantic information of context and introduction of an emotion knowledge base to enhance aspect-related emotional information. In previous studies, aspect and context were modeled separately. Hence, to enhance the representation of sentiment between the aspect and contexts, we use the interactive modeling of aspect and context at the output layer to obtain deeper information through mutual learning. Our SSK-GAT model improved on three publicly available datasets compared to the baseline approaches.

DE News recommendation; Graph convolutional network; HIN embedding
AB In recent years, network representation learning is considered as a crucial research direction which explicitly supports multiple problems in information analysis and mining (INAM) domain. Among downstream tasks of INAM, news recommendation is considered as an important task, especially in semantic-rich/heterogeneous networks. Most of previous news recommendation models are mostly relied on the collaborative filtering (CF) approach. The CF-based techniques support to analyze the historical user-item interacting relationships. These relationships are used to extract latent factors and characterize the user's preferences which are later utilize to facilitate the different recommendation tasks. Recent attempts also focus on the integrations of news recommendation with complex representation learning techniques to leverage the accuracy performance. Even multiple models have gained remarkable performance recently, they still encounter challenges. These challenges are related to the sparsity of user-item interaction data and thorough topic-driven user's preference characterization. Moreover, these recent deep neural embedding-based recommendation models also suffer several limitations which are related to the capability of multi-viewed data embedding. Specifically, in the context of semantic-rich/network heterogeneity, they might be unable to fully incorporate the global structural representations of user-item interactions as well as associated data sources. Mainly motivated by remaining challenges, in this paper we propose novel topic-driven heterogeneous information network embedding-based technique which is aimed to effectively deal with the news recommendation, called as THIN4Rec. Our proposed THIN4Rec model enables to jointly capture the rich-semantic latent features of textual data and global structural representations of user-item interactions in the context of heterogeneous networks.

ID SPECTROSCOPY
AB Raman spectroscopy provides a vibrational profile of the molecules and thus can be used to uniquely identify different kinds of materials. This sort of molecule fingerprinting has thus led to the widespread application of Raman spectrum in various fields like medical diagnosis, forensics, mineralogy, bacteriology, virology, etc. Despite the recent rise in Raman spectra data volume, there has not been any significant effort in developing generalized machine learning methods targeted toward Raman spectra analysis. We examine, experiment, and evaluate existing methods and conjecture that neither current sequential models nor traditional machine learning models are satisfactorily sufficient to analyze Raman spectra. Both have their perks and pitfalls; therefore, we attempt to mix the best of both worlds and propose a novel network architecture RamanNet. RamanNet is immune to the invariance property in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and at the same time better than traditional machine learning models for the inclusion of sparse connectivity. This has been achieved by incorporating shifted multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) at the earlier levels of the network to extract significant features across the entire spectrum, which are further refined by the inclusion of triplet loss in the hidden layers. Our experiments on 4 public datasets demonstrate superior performance over the much more complex state-of-the-art methods, and thus, RamanNet has the potential to become the de facto standard in Raman spectra data analysis.

AB As a common data-driven method, artificial neural networks have been widely used in electricity spot price forecasting. To improve the accuracy of short-term forecasts, this paper proposes an optimized artificial neural network model for monthly electricity spot prices forecasting. A genetic algorithm is applied to regulate the weights and biases parameters of the artificial neural network structure. This study uses various historical dataset at monthly periods selected from Nordic electricity spot prices. For efficiency comparison, one-step ahead forecast method based on Schwartz-Smith stochastic model and two other prediction models, artificial neural network trained by Levenberg-Marquardt and particle swarm optimization algorithms are also presented. The comparison results show that the prediction model based on the genetic optimization algorithm is more accurate than the other prediction models. The proposed forecasting model can be considered as an alternative technique for the electricity spot price forecasting in the Nordic regions.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB Multi-view support vector machines (MvSVMs) have been widely used to solve multi-view classification problems. However, the conventional MvSVMs often overlook the presence of noise and outliers that commonly exist in the original data. In this paper, we propose two novel multi-view intuitionistic fuzzy support vector machines with insensitive pinball loss that can not only handle the general multi-view classification problems but also be robust to noisy data. In the proposed convex optimization models, the pinball loss is incorporated into the multi-view learning, which enables the maximization of the quantization distance. Moreover, to utilize multi-view information more effectively, the intuitionistic fuzzy score is introduced to assign a weight to each multi-view sample. The intuitionistic fuzzy score combines the membership and non-membership functions, which provides an efficient mechanism to assign weights to the multi-view samples. Further, we provide a discussion of the proposed models with the state-of-the-art technologies. Experiments are conducted on a series of datasets, and the results show that the proposed convex models outperform several state-of-the-art models.

DE Near infrared spectroscopy; Gramian angle field; Quaternion
   convolutional neural network; Compound fertilizer
AB This paper combines near infrared spectroscopy with deep learning theory to propose a rapid identification method for compound fertilizer based on gramian angular field (GAF) image coding and quaternion convolutional neural network (QCNN). First, the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of 200 samples of two types of compound with and without polyglutamic acid (& gamma;-PGA) were collected and pretreated by multivariate scattering correction (MSC) and first derivative methods. Then, the one-dimensional (1D) NIR spectra were transformed into twodimensional (2D) images by GAF coding method to express the spectral information more intuitively. Finally, three images of Gramian angular difference field (GADF), Gramian angular summation field (GASF) and their average images were formed into a pure quaternion matrix for parallel representation and were analyzed by the designed QCNN. The peak features and minor features were mined based on the automatic learning function of multi-layer structure of QCNN to establish a high-performance, qualitative model for identifying compound fertilizer. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the identification model were 95.84%, 95.96% and 94.25%, respectively. Compared with the classification results based on traditional partial least square discrimination analysis(PLS-DA), principal component analysis combing with support vector machine classification(PCA-SVM), 1D convolution neural network (1DCNN) and GAF-CNN methods, the classification accuracy and adaptability of the model based on the proposed GAF-QCNN method have been significantly improved. The combination of GAF image of NIR spectra and QCNN developed in this study provides a novel approach for the intelligent modeling algorithm of NIR spectroscopy technology.

ID SIGNATURE
AB Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technique used to prevent the two contradictory problems of data silos and data privacy. Different from centralized learning, FL makes it possible to learn a global model while private data are stored locally. Nevertheless, statistical heterogeneity is a major challenge that has not been well addressed in literature and the interpretability of the model is always ignored. In this paper, an interpretable FL framework is constructed for machine condition monitoring and fault diagnosis. Since fault characteristic frequencies (FCFs) and their harmonics are closely connected with specific machine fault types, an interpretable local client model is designed to identify the FCFs and their harmonics of different clients. Theoretical investigation on the additivity of local model parameters in this paper prove that learned local parameters from the frequency domain are actually FCFs and their harmonics and their additivity is capable of constructing a fault feature library, which is beneficial to providing different fault information and quickly diagnosing fault types. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experiments with two independent bearing run-to-failure datasets.

AB Nowadays, the medical tourism industry encourages many healthcare practitioners to provide high-quality and low-cost medical services for patients worldwide. The development of operations research models and algorithms is one important instrument for improving the medical tourism industry based on the economic, political, social, and cultural aspects. In this paper, a medical tourism trip design problem is developed where patients travel from their city of residence to a destination city that may be in another country to receive high-quality and low-cost medical care. The most important part of this problem is to visit a number of tourist cities for each patient individually in the destination. In addition to the total cost, the patients prefer to increase the attractiveness of trips by referring to the quality of medical services and the attractiveness of visiting tourist cities. As far as we know in the area of medical tourist studies, no study has considered the minimization of total cost and maximization of the attractiveness of trips, simultaneously using utility function. The proposed multi-objective optimization model assigns the patients from the origin country to the hospitals in the destination country while making their routing and scheduling decisions to visit the tourist cities. The proposed model is limited by patients' interests and time restrictions while allocating patients to the hospital and orienteering the patients toward visiting tourist attractions. As a complex optimization problem, another significant novelty of this paper is the proposal of a local search-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (LSNSGA-II) for solving the proposed multi-objective optimization model. The proposed algorithm is compared with the original non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and epsilon constraint (EC) method based on different multi-objective criteria. Finally, one main finding from our analyses is finding a trade-off between the total cost and attractiveness of trips as a challenging decision while proposing high-quality solutions in a reasonable time (i.e., less than one hour).

AB Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is an essential task in online advertising recommender systems. As a hot research frontier driven by academic and industrial needs, CTR prediction has observed remarkable progress in recent years. How to effectively learn sophisticated feature interactions hidden behind user behaviors is critical in maximizing CTR. Targeted at the above issue, this paper first constructs a deep interaction compressed network model (abbreviated as DICN) that aims to generate both low- and high-order feature interactions with different weights in both explicit and implicit fashions. Then, a KD-DICN model is created using a knowledge distillation framework to reduce the complexity of DICN. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models, which outperform the existing state-ofthe-art methods. Therefore, the research presented in this paper can not only enrich and develop the theories related to CTR prediction, but it can also assist some advertising industries in better defining their service audience and recommending more popular contents to consumers more accurately. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Open-source, publicly available neuroimaging datasets - whether from large-scale data collection efforts or pooled from multiple smaller studies - offer unprecedented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. Releasing data can democratize science, increase the replicability of findings, and lead to discoveries. Partly due to patient privacy, computational, and data storage concerns, researchers typically release preprocessed data with the voxelwise time series parcellated into a map of predefined regions, known as an atlas. However, releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. This is especially true for connectomics, as connectomes created from different atlases are not directly comparable. Since there exist several atlases with no gold standards, it is unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. Together, these limitations directly inhibit the potential benefits of open-source neuroimaging data. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT) to find a mapping between two atlases. This approach allows data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without the need for raw data access. To validate CAROT, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can generalize to publicly available data that was processed with different atlases. Overall, CAROT can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases - without needing the raw data - allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide range of analyses while eliminating redundant processing efforts. We share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).

TI Edge convolutional networks: Decomposing graph convolutional networks

SO NEUROCOMPUTING

DT Article
DE Graph convolutional network; Stochastic training; Sampling; Attention
AB After the success of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), many stochastic training methods have been proposed to resolve the scalability and efficiency issues of GCN by sampling. In mini-batch training, a common phase of these methods is to form a small-scale subgraph rooting in the given batch. The sub-graph formation leads to heavy time consumption, additional space occupation, and complex implemen-tation. To rectify these issues, we eliminate the subgraph formation phase and propose Edge Convolutional Network (ECN), which is trained with independently sampled edges. It has constant time complexity for sampling, reducing the sampling time by orders of magnitude without compromising con-vergence speed. Specifically, when there are two convolutional layers, as in the most common situation, GCN can also be trained with the techniques behind ECN, gaining substantial sampling time reduction without trade-offs. We prove that the expressiveness difference between ECN and GCN is theoretically bounded and examine the inference performance of ECN through excessive experiments on real-world, large-scale graphs. Furthermore, we improve ECN with advanced mechanisms of GCN, including skip con-nection, identity mapping, embedding, and attention. With proper mechanisms integrated, ECN rivals state-of-the-art (SotA) baselines in inductive node classification and produces new SotA accuracy on the dataset of Flickr.

ID MODEL
AB In several fields, deep learning has achieved tremendous success. Multi-view learning is a workable method for handling data from several sources. For clustering multi-view data, deep learning and multi-view learning are excellent options. However, a persistent challenge is a need for the current deep learn-ing approach to independently drive divergent neural networks for different perspectives while working with multi-view data. The current methods use the number of viewpoints to calculate neural network statistics. Consequently, as the number of views rises, it results in a considerable calculation. Further-more, they vainly try to unite various viewpoints at the training. Incorporating a triple fusion technique, this research suggests an innovative multi-view deep embedding clustering (MDEC) model. The suggested model can jointly acquire the specific knowledge in each view as well as the information fragment of the collective views. The main goal of the MDEC is to lower the errors made when learning the features of each view and correlating data from many views. To address the optimization problem, the MDEC model advises a suitable iterative updating approach. In testing modern deep learning and non-deep learning algorithms, the experimental study on small and large-scale multi-view data shows encouraging results for the MDEC model. In multi-view clustering, this work demonstrates the benefit of the deep learning-based approach over the non-ones. However, future work will address a variety of issues related to MDEC including the speed. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Equipping a legged robot with a manipulator enables versatile mobile manipulation, significantly improving its performance in various tasks. However, developing a unified framework for diverse robotic arms and legged robots presents a challenge. This study proposes a disturbance predictive control framework where a high-level estimator cooperates with a disturbance-based low-level controller. Further, a transportable latent dynamic adapter is introduced to enable the model to migrate rapidly to different robotic arms. Our method can adapt well to other manipulators with a few samples. Further, the effectiveness of our method was demonstrated via simulation and real experiments. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the aggravation of the global energy crisis, fuel consumption has become a key indicator for excavator manufacturers and policymakers. However, traditional experimental and theoretical approaches, which are complicated to calculate and dependent on the laboratory environment, are difficult to be applied in engineering. A data-driven prediction system consisting of data acquisition, feature decomposition, fuel consumption prediction, and performance evaluation modules, is developed to achieve excavator fuel consumption prediction during operation. The characteristic parameters of excavator energy consumption are collected through the established data acquisition module and the superfluous noise is eliminated by the feature decomposition module. A prediction model based on Informer is proposed in the fuel consumption prediction module to solve the drawback that the neural network model cannot capture key information in long series data in parallel, thus improving the prediction accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of different prediction methods is verified by the performance prediction module.

AB The emergence of visually realistic GAN-generated facial images has raised concerns regarding potential misuse. In response, effective forensic algorithms have been developed to detect such synthetic images in recent years. However, the vulnerability of such forensic detectors to adversarial attacks remains an important issue that requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack method against GAN-generated image detectors. It involves contrastive learning strategy to train an encoder-decoder anti -forensic network with a contrastive loss function. GAN-generated and corresponding simulated real images are constructed as positive and negative samples, respectively. By leveraging the trained attack model, we can apply imperceptible perturbation to input synthetic images for removing GAN fingerprint to some extent. GAN-generated image detectors may be deceived consequently. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack effectively reduces the accuracy of three state-of-the-art detectors on six popular GANs, while also achieving high visual quality of the attacked images.

AB This paper investigates the Hoo master-slave synchronization problem for delayed impulsive implicit hybrid neural networks based on memory-state feedback control. By developing a more holistic stochastic impulse-time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and dealing with the nonlinear neuron activation function, the stochastic admissibility and prescribed Hoo performance index for the synchronization error closed-loop system are achieved. In addition, the desired mode-dependent memory-state feedback synchronization controller is acquired in the form of linear matrix inequalities. The free-weighting matrix technique is adopted to remove the inherent limitation of time-varying delay derivative for the implicit delayed systems, and the derivative of time-varying delay is relaxed enough to be greater than 1. The simulation of genetic regulatory network in bio-economic system is given to verify validity of the derived results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) provide decision makers (DMs) with an overall trade-off Pareto front. However, in practice, DMs are generally interested in a specific subset of the Pareto front that satisfies their preferences; this subset is known as the region of interest (ROI). Existing preference-based MOEAs may fail to provide satisfactory ROIs to DMs owing to inaccurate analysis of the DM's preference information or weak diversity maintenance. This study proposes a multi-objective coevolutionary algorithm (MOCA) based on the DM's preference direction (MOCA-PD), inspired by the mechanism of the social division of labor. To achieve the social goal of obtaining the ROI, a search center is generated by a preference model based on the DM's preference direction. The preference model uses the search center as the criterion for the social selection of talents, with some solutions that meet the DM's preferences selected as social leaders. To accelerate the realization of the social goal, the preference model assigns team members according to the leader's ability; this is similar to how more capable leaders lead more team members in a society. Two teamwork operations are defined for team members to communicate (crossover and mutation) and generate offspring that are better aligned with the DM's preferences. In addition, the diversity of social leaders is ensured by introducing an elite archive and ������-dominance mechanism. Experimental results on the ZDT, DTLZ, and MaF problems show that the proposed algorithm can effectively guide the population to the ROI, enabling DMs to make better and more reliable decisions.

AB With the rapid progress of Mobile Internet of Things (MIoT), Location-Based Services (LBSs) have become widely popular due to the deployment of diverse devices and facilities. The utilization of spatial-temporal information has led to a considerable improvement in service recommendation in the MIoT-enabled service platform. In practical scenarios, the interaction between the user and the service is often initiated by the joint effect of previous service invocations. Many-to-many and high-order spatial-temporal relations exist among services, which are inadequately reflected by prevailing methods that rely on ordinary graphs and consider spatial-temporal relations among services as pairwise connections. Additionally, most methods indiscriminately conflate the separate influences of spatial and temporal information on user preferences, which can lead to suboptimal service recommendation performance. To this end, we propose an approach powered by spatial-temporal hypergraphs (STH) for personalized service recommendation in the MIoT-enabled service platform, which is inspired by the deep learning paradigm. Specifically, we first construct spatial and temporal hypergraphs based on spatial-temporal information. Then, we develop the spatial-temporal hypergraph neural network-based encoders to learn spatial and temporal representations of services. Finally, we introduce an auxiliary task to differentiate between distinct spatial-temporal effects for improved service recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of STH. Thus, STH not only enhances the user experience but also improves service management in the MIoT-enabled service platform.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Fault detection and isolation are two significant problems in process monitoring. However, due to the complicated relationships between the process variables, it becomes a challenging problem to build a model to capture the complicated relationship between process variables and perform fault detection and isolation based on the model. This paper proposes an advanced model, called multi-task long short-term memory (MTLSTM) neural networks, that can capture the most complicated relationships between process variables and a simultaneous fault detection and isolation approach based on MTLSTM neural networks. The proposed simultaneous fault detection and isolation approach takes a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to extract features from the measurements of process variables. Then, a long short-term memory neural network is trained on the extracted features with a multi-task learning strategy. Compared with the traditional multivariate statistical models (MVSM) such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis models, the MTLSTM neural networks can capture the nonlinear autocorrelations of process variables and correlations between process variables and perform fault detection and isolation for an industrial process simultaneously. To demonstrate the advantages and superiority of the proposed simultaneous fault detection and isolation approach, a case study on fault detection and isolation for the penicillin fermentation process is carried out. Case study results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing fault detection and isolation approaches.

DE Low-light image enhancement; Zero-referenced learning; Image processing
AB The current strive toward efficient intelligent visual systems suffers from challenges in the task of low-light image enhancement. To improve image perception, the low-light scenes in different illumination conditions must be properly focused. However, typical CNN-based methods use the same set of parameters for all images, which limits the capability for handling complex scenes. Meanwhile, the existing deep models integrate the low-level and high-level features by simply adding or concatenating operations, lacking unique designs for the low-light image enhancement task. To address the above challenges, we propose a zero-referenced adaptive filter network (ZAFN) for low-light image enhancement. Specifically, the adaptive filters are generated by the integration of high-level contents from multiple partial scenes. The iterative enlightening process is then conducted using the low-level features that are dynamically modulated with the adaptive filters. To alleviate the requirement of paired training data and enable zero-referenced learning, we propose a color enhancement loss, a global consistency loss, and a self-regularized denoising loss for high-quality results. Our ZAFN model, which has a light model size and low computational cost, outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-referenced methods on four popular datasets.

AB Reward shaping using GCNs is a popular research area in reinforcement learning. However, it is difficult to shape potential functions for complicated tasks. In this paper, we develop Reward Shaping with Hi-erarchical Graph Topology (HGT). HGT propagates information about the rewards through the message passing mechanism, which can be used as potential functions for reward shaping. We describe reinforce-ment learning by a probability graph model. Then we generate a underlying graph with each state is a node and edges represent transition probabilities between states. In order to prominently shape po-tential functions for complex environments, HGT divides the underlying graph constructed from states into multiple subgraphs. Since these subgraphs provide a representation of multiple logical relationships between states in the Markov decision process, the aggregation process rich correlation information be-tween nodes, which makes the propagated messages more powerful. When compared to cutting-edge RL techniques, HGT achieves faster learning rates in experiments on Atari and Mujoco tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully applied to collaborative filtering for implicit feedback. However, the ability of GAN to learn user interest distributions is greatly reduced due to its difficulty in characterizing the features. In this paper, a collaborative filtering model based on Improved Generative Adversarial Networks (IGAN) is proposed to address the above issue. In IGAN, we first introduce the independent encoder and generator to learn features representation during adversarial training. Then, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) loss and reconstruction loss are added as the penalty term to further fit the interest distribution of users and achieve higher recommendation accuracy. Finally, this paper conducts extensive experiments on three real public datasets, showing that the IGAN method has a maximum improvement of 5.26% and 5.43% in P@5 and NDCG@5 compared with the current GAN-based methods.

ID MEAN-SHIFT; NUMBER
AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are popular tools for learning the distribution of real samples and generating new ones, where the qualities of the generated images and the degree of preserved variation are two major concerns currently. In view of this, we propose an a-EGAN with energy distance as the loss function of the generator, which is proven to be effective in mitigating mode collapse. Moreover, an early stopping rule is proposed in the frame of hypothesis testing to avoid the unhealthy competition between the generator and the discriminator, thus achieving a trade-off between image qualities and variations. As a byproduct, the energy distance under the Euclidean norm can serve as a novel metric for evaluating generated samples in GAN. Experiments are conducted on simulated manifold datasets, as well as real MNIST and CelebA face datasets, showing that the proposed a-EGAN outperforms several competitors in both training stability and image quality.

DE Hurst-based diffusion model; influence maximization (IM); online social

AB Online social networks have grown exponentially in the recent years while finding applications in real life like marketing, recommendation systems, and social awareness campaigns. An important research area in this field is Influence Maximization, which pertains to finding methods for maximizing the spread of information (influence) across an OSN. Existing works in IM widely use a pre-defined edge propagation probability for node activation. Hurst exponent (H), which depicts the self-similarity in the time series depicting a user's past interaction behaviour, has also been used as activation criteria. In this work, we propose a Time Series Characteristic based Hurst-based Diffusion Model (TSC-HDM), which calculates H based on the stationary or non-stationary characteristic of the time series. TSC-HDM selects a handful of seed nodes and activates a seed node's inactive successor only if H > 0.5. The proposed model has been tested on four real-world OSN datasets. The results have been compared against four other IM models - Independent Cascade, Weighted Cascade, Trivalency, and Hurst-based Influence Maximization. TSC-HDM is found to have achieved as much as 590% higher expected influence spread as compared to the other models. Moreover, TSC-HDM has attained 344% better average influence spread than other state-of-the-art models namely LIR, A-Greedy, LPIMA, Genetic Algorithm with Dynamic Probabilities, NeighborsRemove, DegreeDecrease, IGIM, IRR, and PHG.

AB Modeling metal additive manufacturing processes is of great importance because it allows for the production of objects that are closer to the desired geometry and mechanical properties. Over-deposition often takes place during laser metal deposition, especially when the deposition head changes its direction and results in more material being melted onto the substrate. Modeling over-deposition is one of the necessary steps toward online process control, as a good model can be used in a closed-loop system to adjust the deposition parameters in real-time to reduce this phenomenon. In this study, we present a long-short memory neural network to model over-deposition. The model has been trained on simple geometries such as straight tracks, spiral and V-tracks made of Inconel 718. The model shows good generalization capabilities and can predict the height of more complex and previously unseen random tracks with limited performance loss. After the addition to the training dataset of a small amount of data coming from the random tracks, the performance of the model for such additional shapes improves significantly, making this approach feasible for more general applications as well.

AB The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in news media communication has significantly enhanced the effectiveness and coverage of news data releases. However, as the scale of news data continues to grow, traditional IoT approaches face challenges such as slow data processing speed and low mining efficiency. To address these issues, a novel news feature mining system combining IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been developed. The hardware components of the system include a data collector, a data analyzer, a central controller, and sensors. The GJ-HD data collector is utilized to gather news data. Multiple network interfaces are designed at the device terminal to ensure data extraction from the internal disk in case of device failure. The central controller integrates the MP/MC and DCNF interfaces for seamless information interconnection. In the software aspect of the system, the network transmission protocol of the AI algorithm is embedded, and a communication feature model is constructed. This enables fast and accurate mining of news data communication features. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a mining accuracy of over 98%, enabling efficient processing of news data. Overall, the proposed IoT and AI-based news feature mining system overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches, allowing for efficient and accurate processing of news data in a rapidly expanding digital landscape.

AB Establishing the relationship between a limited number of samples and segmented objects in diverse scenarios is the primary challenge in few-shot segmentation. However, many previous works overlooked the crucial support-query set interaction and the deeper information that needs to be explored. This oversight can lead to model failure when confronted with complex scenarios, such as ambiguous boundaries. To solve this problem, a duplex network that utilizes the suppression and focus concept is proposed to effectively suppress the background and focus on the foreground. Our network includes dynamic convolution to enhance the support-query interaction and a prototype match structure to fully extract information from support and query. The proposed model is called dynamic prototype mixture convolutional networks (DPMC). To minimize the impact of redundant information, we have incorporated a hybrid attentional module called double-layer attention augmented convolutional module (DAAConv) into DPMC. This module enables the network to concentrate more on foreground information. Our experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets suggested that DPMC and DAAConv outperform traditional prototype-based methods by up to 5-8% on average.

AB IntroductionPeople are today increasingly relying on health information they find online to make decisions that may impact both their physical and mental wellbeing. Therefore, there is a growing need for systems that can assess the truthfulness of such health information. Most of the current literature solutions use machine learning or knowledge-based approaches treating the problem as a binary classification task, discriminating between correct information and misinformation. Such solutions present several problems with regard to user decision making, among which: (i) the binary classification task provides users with just two predetermined possibilities with respect to the truthfulness of the information, which users should take for granted; indeed, (ii) the processes by which the results were obtained are often opaque and the results themselves have little or no interpretation. MethodsTo address these issues, we approach the problem as an ad hoc retrieval task rather than a classification task, with reference, in particular, to the Consumer Health Search task. To do this, a previously proposed Information Retrieval model, which considers information truthfulness as a dimension of relevance, is used to obtain a ranked list of both topically-relevant and truthful documents. The novelty of this work concerns the extension of such a model with a solution for the explainability of the results obtained, by relying on a knowledge base consisting of scientific evidence in the form of medical journal articles. Results and discussionWe evaluate the proposed solution both quantitatively, as a standard classification task, and qualitatively, through a user study to examine the "explained" ranked list of documents. The results obtained illustrate the solution's effectiveness and usefulness in making the retrieved results more interpretable by Consumer Health Searchers, both with respect to topical relevance and truthfulness.

AB In this article, a fully distributed event-triggered protocol is proposed to solve the consensus problem of uncertain Euler-Lagrange (EL) multiagent systems (MASs) under jointly connected digraphs. First, distributed event-based reference generators are proposed to generate continuously differentiable reference signals via event-based communication under jointly connected digraphs. Unlike some existing works, only the states of agents rather than virtual internal reference variables need to be transmitted among agents. Second, adaptive controllers are exploited based on the reference generators so that each agent can track the reference signals. The uncertain parameters converge to their real values under an initially exciting (IE) assumption. It is proved that the uncertain EL MAS achieves state consensus asymptotically under the proposed event-triggered protocol composed of the reference generators and the adaptive controllers. A unique feature of the proposed event-triggered protocol is its fully distributed property: the protocol does not depend on global information about the jointly connected digraphs. Meanwhile, a minimum interevent time (MIET) is guaranteed. Finally, two simulations are conducted to show the validity of the proposed protocol.

AB Data augmentation is an effective way to improve the generalization of deep learning models. However, the underlying augmentation methods mainly rely on handcrafted operations, such as flipping and cropping for image data. These augmentation methods are often designed based on human expertise or repeated trials. Meanwhile, automated data augmentation (AutoDA) is a promising research direction that frames the data augmentation process as a learning task and finds the most effective way to augment the data. In this survey, we categorize recent AutoDA methods into the composition-, mixing-, and generation-based approaches and analyze each category in detail. Based on the analysis, we discuss the challenges and future prospects as well as provide guidelines for applying AutoDA methods by considering the dataset, computation effort, and availability of domain-specific transformations. It is hoped that this article can provide a useful list of AutoDA methods and guidelines for data partitioners when deploying AutoDA in practice. The survey can also serve as a reference for further study by researchers in this emerging research area.

AB Labeled samples are important in achieving land cover change detection (LCCD) tasks via deep learning techniques with remote sensing images. However, labeling samples for change detection with bitemporal remote sensing images is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, manually labeling samples between bitemporal images requires professional knowledge for practitioners. To address this problem in this article, an iterative training sample augmentation (ITSA) strategy to couple with a deep learning neural network for improving LCCD performance is proposed here. In the proposed ITSA, we start by measuring the similarity between an initial sample and its four-quarter-overlapped neighboring blocks. If the similarity satisfies a predefined constraint, then a neighboring block will be selected as the potential sample. Next, a neural network is trained with renewed samples and used to predict an intermediate result. Finally, these operations are fused into an iterative algorithm to achieve the training and prediction of a neural network. The performance of the proposed ITSA strategy is verified with some widely used change detection deep learning networks using seven pairs of real remote sensing images. The excellent visual performance and quantitative comparisons from the experiments clearly indicate that detection accuracies of LCCD can be effectively improved when a deep learning network is coupled with the proposed ITSA. For example, compared with some state-of-the-art methods, the quantitative improvement is 0.38%-7.53% in terms of overall accuracy. Moreover, the improvement is robust, generic to both homogeneous and heterogeneous images, and universally adaptive to various neural networks of LCCD. The code will be available at https://github.com/ImgSciGroup/ITSA.

AB Most commonly, stability analyses are performed using an external validation measure. For example, the Jaccard index is one of the indexes of choice for stability measurement. The index is wrapped around a resampling method to sense the model's stability. Other methods use classifiers to look for stable partitions instead. In these cases, a resampling method is also used with an external index, an error measure driven by a classifier, and a clustering algorithm aiming to find stable clustering model configurations. Contrary to previous stability-based methods, we propose a novel validation procedure consisting of an internal validation index within a resampling strategy. We propose an index based on the distance between cluster centroids coupled with a twofold cross-validation resampling approach. Moreover, we use a threshold based on a null hypothesis to detect meaningful clustering partitions. As part of our experimental study, we have selected the K-means algorithm because of its simplicity but primarily for its instability compared to other algorithms, such as Hierarchical methods. Finally, we compare our approach with several known validation indexes and discuss the results. Our findings show that our method cannot only find meaningful clustering partitions but is also helpful as an unsupervised data analysis tool.

AB Anomalous human activity detection is highly essential due to its numerous uses in both public and private safety. Autoencoders-based normality modeling approaches detect some anomalous events as normal activities. We propose an effective strategy Bag-of-Adapted-Model (BoAM)-based approaches that utilize multiple Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models (AGMMs). In the first approach, two base class GMMs are constructed for normal and anomalous event classes. Then, adapted GMMs are constructed using training snippets of normal and anomalous events by adapting the corresponding base class GMMs to derive class-specific characteristics in AGMM. For a given video segment, likelihood-based embeddings provide improved discrimination between normal and anomalous event classes. BoAM can also be created using only normal occurrences of training data, and then, the representations fed to OC-SVM in order to detect outliers. Another variant of BoAM that used Universal Background Model (UBM) as a base model (BoAM_UBM) for adaptation gives comparable performance. Results over three standard datasets proved the consistent improvement. The proposed embeddings are suitable for detecting abnormalities even with smaller amount of anomalous training data.

This paper analyses and discusses some key philosophical assumptions in these debates, in particular assumptions about authorship and language and-our focus-the use of the appearance/reality distinction. We show that there are alternative views of what goes on with ChatGPT that do not rely on this distinction. For this purpose, we deploy the two phased approach of deconstruction and relate our finds to questions regarding authorship and language in the humanities. We also identify and respond to two common counter-objections in order to show the ethical appeal and practical use of our proposal.

AB A key issue in critical contexts such as medical diagnosis is the interpretability of the deep learning models adopted in decision-making systems. Research in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is trying to solve this issue. However, often XAI approaches are only tested on generalist classifier and do not represent realistic problems such as those of medical diagnosis. In this paper, we aim at improving the trust and confidence of users towards automatic AI decision systems in the field of medical skin lesion diagnosis by customizing an existing XAI approach for explaining an AI model able to recognize different types of skin lesions. The explanation is generated through the use of synthetic exemplar and counter-exemplar images of skin lesions and our contribution offers the practitioner a way to highlight the crucial traits responsible for the classification decision. A validation survey with domain experts, beginners, and unskilled people shows that the use of explanations improves trust and confidence in the automatic decision system. Also, an analysis of the latent space adopted by the explainer unveils that some of the most frequent skin lesion classes are distinctly separated. This phenomenon may stem from the intrinsic characteristics of each class and may help resolve common misclassifications made by human experts.

   CLASSIFICATION
AB Training with unlabeled datasets using self-supervised models has the edge over training with labeled datasets, reducing human effort, and no need for annotated data during training. The knowledge obtained from the pre-trained self-supervised model can be transferred to an image classifier as a target task. Transferring knowledge from source to target task requires tuning a large number of hyperparameters, such as number of CNN layers, number of filters in each CNN layer, kernel size, stride, number of fully connected (FC) layers, units in each FC layer, dropouts, learning rate, and many more. An efficient process is required to automatically tune these hyperparameters to reduce the manual efforts and enhance the performance of the self-supervised model. This paper uses a pre-trained self-supervised model to transfer knowledge for image classification. We propose an efficient Bayesian optimization-based method for automatically tuning (autotuning) the hyperparameters of the self-supervised model during the knowledge transfer. The proposed autotuned image classifier consists of a few CNN layers followed by an FC layer. Finally, we use a softmax layer to obtain the probability of classes for the images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, state-of-the-art self-supervised models such as SimClr, SWAV, and SWAV 2x are used to extract the learned features. According to our experiments on three benchmarked datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny Imagenet datasets), the proposed method not only enhances the performances of the self-supervised models, but also provides state-of-the-art results.

AB In the video surveillance, cameras often jitter slightly because of some uncertain factors like wind, loose of bracket, and so on, which may add more difficulties to subsequent intelligent video analysis. Then, it is great significant to detect whether and how is a camera jittering. In this paper, a concept, i.e. region of reference (ROR), is defined, and a framework and method of surveillance camera jitter detection is proposed through perceiving the location changes of the ROR. First, an extraction model of motion information is established to extract and eliminate the moving information such as moving objects, swaying leaves, etc. Second, global contrast and octree color quantization are employed to filter out the significant regions in the background, then, the most representative regions are chosen as the RORs by tracking the boundary of significant regions. Third, the RORs and their surrounding image features are extracted and input into the filter to construct the response map, then, the corresponding region of peak value in the response map is perceived for location change. Average accuracy of the proposed method on video jitter data set is 95.36%. The experimental results show that the proposed method can solve the problem of video jitter detection in complex scenes.

DE Hand pose estimation; Quaternion convolution; Graph neural network
AB 3D Hand Pose Estimation (HPE) is a task of recognizing the 3D joints of the hand from static images or dynamic video frames, which is an important topic in human-computer interaction and computer vision. Even though the rise of deep learning promotes the accuracy quite a lot, previous CNN-based methods still suffer from two drawbacks in nature. On one hand, real-valued CNNs break the original structure of the RGB images, and learn color features dependencies and hidden relations mixedly resulting in prediction difficulty when skin is similar. On the other hand, the feature representation for each pixel is only learned by local convolution while the global context information is ignored. To alleviate these problems, we propose a deep learning architecture, named Quaternion Multi-Graph Reasoning Network (QMGR-Net), which contains two novel modules: Quaternion Separation Learning Module (RSLM) and Global Quaternion Reasoning Module (GQRM). The RSLM is proposed to learn color feature dependencies and hidden relations such as edges or shapes at the different level where features can be learned in the quaternion space. Besides, the GQRM is proposed to explicitly capture the interactions among hand joints and model the relationship of non-adjacent nodes. Compared with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the STB dataset and the RHD dataset, we achieve the best results with 7.27 EPE and 18.59 EPE, respectively, which exhibit the effectiveness of our method.

AB The max-flow problem entails the computation of a maximum feasible flow from a source to a sink through a network under constraints. Its connection to total variation presents an opportunity to apply the problem to machine learning tasks by incorporating a similarity graph-based setting. In this paper, we integrate max-flow and duality techniques, similarity graph-based frameworks, semi-supervised procedures, class size information and class homogeneity terms to derive three algorithms for machine learning tasks, such as classification, and image segmentation. The first algorithm involves similarity graph-based max-flow incorporating supervised constraints and class size information. The second method involves a duality approach and global minimization of similarity graph-based total variation problems incorporating class size information. The third algorithm involves graph-based convex optimization via max-flow techniques for image segmentation problems involving region parameters, in the case the latter is unknown. An important advantage of the methods is that they require only a small set of labeled samples for good accuracy, in part due to the integration of graph-based and semi-supervised techniques; this is an important advantage due to the scarcity of labeled data. Moreover, some of the proposed algorithms are based on global minimization, and are also able to incorporate class size information, which often improves performance. In addition, the methods perform well on both large and small data sets, the latter of which can result in poor performances for learning methods due to a decreased ability to learn from observed data. The proposed methods are validated using benchmark data sets and are compared favorably to recent methods.

AB Boolean networks (BNs) are well-studied models of genomic regulation in biology where nodes are genes and their state transition is controlled by Boolean functions. We propose to learn Boolean functions as Boolean formulas in disjunctive normal form (DNFs) by an explainable neural network Mat_DNF and apply it to learning BNs. Directly expressing DNFs as a pair of binary matrices, we learn them using a single layer NN by minimizing a logically inspired non-negative cost function to zero. As a result, every parameter in the network has a clear meaning of representing a conjunction or literal in the learned DNF. Also we can prove that learning DNFs by the proposed approach is equivalent to inferring interpolants in logic between the positive and negative data. We applied our approach to learning three literature-curated BNs and confirmed its effectiveness. We also examine how generalization occurs when learning data is scarce. In doing so, we introduce two new operations that can improve accuracy, or equivalently generalizability for scarce data. The first one is to append a noise vector to the input learning vector. The second one is to continue learning even after learning error becomes zero. The first one is explainable by the second one. These two operations help us choose a learnable DNF, i.e., a root of the cost function, to achieve high generalizability.

AB In this study, a pseudo-maximization by parts method is introduced by developing the maximization by parts algorithm for the parameter estimation of pseudo-copula regression models. Sub- and main score equations are obtained from the pairwise log-likelihood function and solved by the proposed iterative algorithm. The pseudo-maximization by parts algorithm is an iterative algorithm to avoid having to calculate the second-order derivative of the full log-likelihood function as maximization by parts algorithm. Instead of the Gaussian copula function in maximization by parts algorithm, the pseudo-Gaussian copula function is included in the new algorithm. The mean square errors of the estimators found by the maximization by parts algorithm and the pseudo-maximization by parts algorithm are compared using real Turkish comprehensive insurance data taken from the Turkish Insurance Information and Monitoring Center for the year 2017, and it is notable that the proposed algorithm provided better results in terms of having lower errors.

AB The natural gas industry faces significant challenges in implementing industrial filtration systems that are both sustainable and maintainable. These are complex issues that necessitate a thorough and pragmatic evaluation to ensure that the technology is both effective and efficient. Due to the increasing importance of environmental sustainability and the need to reduce waste and emissions, the deployment of filtration technology must be carefully evaluated to ensure that it meets these objectives. The goal of this study is to develop a decision-making approach based on Aczel-Alsina (AA) operations, which provide a variety of advantages when dealing with real-world issues. To begin, we'll go over some new hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy set operations such the Aczel-Alsina product, sum, exponent, and scalar multiplication. The suggested AOs are based on AA operations and are used to prioritize industrial filtering technologies while keeping sustainability and maintainability in mind. Several solutions are studied for managing impurities produced by Pakistan's natural gas sector. After careful evaluation, it has been determined that the cyclo-filter technology is the most viable solution for the natural gas industry. This technology has been chosen due to its adaptability with the regional and local conditions of the study area. By utilizing this technology, policymakers can gain practical insight into process energy and environmental systems and effectively control contamination in the natural gas industry. This decision-making framework offers a new and innovative approach to address sustainability and maintainability challenges in the industry.

AB Legislative policies in environmental protection tended to confront and address ecological issues through comprehensive and integrated legislation. Recycling is essential for treating waste batteries, considering sustainable economic, environmental, and social standards. Therefore, this study investigates a battery recycling plant location (BRPL) problem. However, determining the sustainable BRPL is a complex task that requires consideration of many conflicting criteria and their qualitative and quantitative factors. Accordingly, a general index system of sustainability criteria has been introduced, including four basic criteria, namely economic, technical, environmental, and socio-political criteria, as well as 22 sub-criteria. To deal with these multiple criteria and their sub-criteria, a multi-criteria decision-making tool is introduced. Initially, the entropy method was used to determine the relative importance of the main sustainability criteria and their sub-criteria. Afterward, the simple multi-attribute rating technique was applied to rank seven selected BRPLs according to their sustainability. Finally, comparative and sensitivity analyses were conducted to check the proposed model's consistency, robustness, and stability. The findings show that the environmental criterion is the most important criterion, with a weight of 0.349. Findings from this work will help policymakers and practitioners in Egypt's current advancement in the battery recycling industry.

AB To promote the development of a green environment, it is necessary to build a friendly environment for green travel and increase the use of green resources. Methods based on remote sensing image processing and feature analysis have become one of the main ways to obtain ground information, and have been widely used and promoted. Therefore, ground targets the accuracy of object recognition and features have been significantly improved. In the lightweight image of the city, the terrain occupies almost 80% of the buildings and roads. Urban buildings play an important role in supporting the operation, management and planning of the city. An important technology for the construction of digital towns in the future is the city. Building identification, therefore, the research of building identification is more important in the development of the city. With the widespread application of artificial intelligence deep learning and the popularization of smart technologies, the digital images generated by the Internet and mobile smart terminals have exponentially increased. Image data provides users with a comfortable experience and convenient services, but it also brings many challenges. How to filter out the photos we are interested in from a large amount of image data and find the content we need is a data difficulty. In computer vision research, image search systems can solve the problem of searching for the same content in many digital images. This paper applies deep learning and lightweight images to search systems to promote the development of urban building recognition.

AB Appraising some sustainability indicators for changes of others, or comprehensively assessing all metrics, while maintaining sustainability performance, is a crucial consideration for decision-makers. Moreover, numerous real-world applications involve factors that possess an ambiguous status as either input or output, commonly referred to as flexible measures, as well as imprecise measures. Accordingly, this research introduces a fuzzy flexible directional distance model for evaluating sustainable systems with fuzzy flexible measures. Subsequently, a fuzzy inverse directional distance approach, founded on data envelopment analysis and incorporating flexible measures, is proposed to assess the alteration of some imprecise sustainability criteria in response to changes in other measures while maintaining sustainability performance. Also, the modifications of all sustainability dimensions are dealt with while the sustainability performance level remains unchanged. An instance of numerical illustration and practical implementation within the healthcare industry has been presented to showcase the introduced methodology. The findings suggest that the technique proposed in this study has proven to be advantageous and enlightening for evaluating specific dimensions of sustainability in relation to alternations of other indicators or comprehensively addressing modifications of all sustainability indicators, while simultaneously preserving the ability of entities with fuzzy flexible measures.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Dynamic pricing (DP) alters product prices at the ideal moment and under the ideal conditions to boost a company's profit. Numerous third-party DP solutions are currently available, offering APIs and standard regulations like competitive pricing. However, many organizations prefer to create their in-house solutions due to the complexity and size of enormous e-commerce (EC) operations and the limited customizability of that third-party software. This paper proposes a novel deep learning algorithm, namely weight-optimized long short-term memory (WOLSTM) for DP solutions based on customer buying or purchasing behaviour in EC platforms. The proposed work consists of five phases. The missing value imputation and normalization preprocessing technique was initially applied to the collected dataset. After that, the relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed dataset. Then, the dimensionality of the extracted feature set is reduced using the improved principal component analysis method. Next, similar customers are grouped using the hamming silhouette coefficient-based k-means approach, and finally, the prediction of DP for the grouped customers is made using WOLSTM. The proposed system's efficiency is analysed using the electronic products and pricing data dataset. The experimental results indicate that the proposed WOLSTM outperformed state-of-the-art methods regarding the classification metrics and the proposed one yields 98.99% accuracy with less RMSE of 2.356.

AB Breast cancer has become the greatest frequent cancer among worldwide. Machine learning techniques contribute much to cancer prognosis. The prime focus of the work is to enhance the prognosis of breast cancer at an earlier stage using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers. Next-generation genetic sequences of homo sapiens, BRCA1 and BRCA2 from National Centre for Biotechnology Information were derived for prediction of breast cancer. The proposed ensembled classifiers by hard voting and soft voting combined models like decision tree technique, SVM algorithm, LR statistical model, linear discriminant analysis model, Naive Bayes classifier and k-nearest neighbours' algorithm. Five ensembled models from six machine learning classifiers were concatenated for the prediction purpose. Classification accuracy of ensemble hard voting and soft voting classifiers was evaluated statistically. Soft voting classifier for model 1 (DT and SVM) and model 2 (DT, SVM and LR) achieved greatest value for classification performance metrics. Among all ensembled models, model 1 as well as model 2 achieved maximum classification precision of 94%.

AB The Decision-making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) has widespread application in many fields as a system analysis method to explain the relationship between the risk factors in a system. By analyzing the influence relationship and degree of influence among risk factors, DEMATEL can determine their importance and priority. One characteristic of DEMATEL is that expert experience and knowledge should be fully considered. However, in practical applications, there are great uncertainties in the evaluation process because of the differences in experts' historical experiences and subjective opinions. To address this issue, an improved fuzzy evidential DEMATEL method based on the two-dimensional correlation coefficient (2-DCC) and negation of basic probability assignment (BPA) is proposed in this paper. The new method uses 2-DCC to calculate the correlation between different expert evaluations in horizontal and vertical directions to get an overall correlation r and converts it into the macro-credibility and weight of experts. Then, to construct BPA according to the fuzzy evaluations, the total uncertainty (TU) measure and negation of BPA under the framework of evidence theory are used to deal with the uncertainty of evaluation, and then, the evaluations will be weighted and fused. Finally, the DEMATEL method is used to calculate the comprehensive influence matrix, and the importance of each risk factor is calculated. Two applications well verified the effectiveness of our method.

AB The challenge of routing in energy-constrained wireless sensor networks is to balance energy and extend network lifetime, and reinforcement learning is an effective method to address this problem. However, poor learning and decision-making efficiency are still the main factors affecting the network routing performance. In this research, RLR-TET is proposed as a reinforcement learning approach that evaluates the shortest routing and achieves node energy balance. First, this study employs a method in which each node broadcasts control information directly to its neighbor nodes, allowing learning to be accomplished by simple communication. Second, multiple greedy action chains form a tree structure by learning to build a greedy action chain. Third, the tree is dynamically adjusted during the learning process. Toward the root, each sensor node can obtain its optimal next hop; toward the leaf, each sensor node can achieve the update of the learning errors. Fourth, the learning errors of V-values are backpropagated along the tree to multi-layer nodes using the eligibility traces approach, achieving fast multi-step updates. In our experiments, we compared the method of this paper with five other algorithms. The number of packets delivered, the number of alive nodes, and the standard deviation of the nodes' remaining energy all improved significantly over time. Experiments have shown that our method responds quickly to network changes, improves the energy balance of network nodes, and successfully extends the lifetime of the network.

AB The usage of internet is getting increased in all aspect, like from building various models that are fully connect with internet to the usage of digital media for 24/7. As this is rising in a way, on the other side, the concern about 'data security' is raising, and everybody's information needs to be protected from any other attacks or can say there should not be no data leakage. So, for detecting these attacks, intrusion detection system is placed. But placing this traditional intrusion detection system (IDS) will increase the concerns of security even more, so to amp the process integration of latest technology such deep learning comes in action. Thereby, this paper proposes an IDS using back propagation network where intrusions are identified based on the system calls that we collected in the dataset KDD cup 99. Also, to increase the optimization of neural network, we used particle swarm optimization thereby increase the accurate detection of the system saying if that is normal or abnormal in behavior.

AB Smart industry paradigms are encouraged for automated and error-less manufacturing and job shop processing with the Industrial Internet of Things. The smart manufacturing environment employs independent machines and devices for providing cost-effective outcomes. The independent operating nature of the machines/devices is lured easily through the external hijackers that degrade the production outcome. By considering the real-time smart industrial process, this paper introduces Performance-focused Process Transaction Framework. The main motive of this work is to ensure secure job transactions in the smart industry with reduced task failures and improved production efficiency. The machines' performance is observed and measured based on the previous job completion rate and successive allocation intervals. Reward-based learning is induced in this framework for monitoring the operation state of the machine/device. The centralized controller makes use of the rewards and states for deciding the allocation without adversary interruption. In this job transaction process, the machine's adversary behavior is vital in determining production efficiency. The adverse behaving nature of the devices is detected in an early stage for reducing task failures. Further, the proposed framework's performance is verified using the metrics like true negative rate, adversary impact, processing time, and task allocation rate.

ID DIAGNOSIS; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM
AB In recent days, healthcare solutions have made significant progress in developing diagnostic mechanisms using machine and deep learning techniques for detecting lung cell cancer. However, the symptoms of lung cancer are common to many other ailments, which may lead to misidentification by healthcare practitioners, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, cancer is often detected in later stages when controlling its spread is difficult, leading to increased mortality rates, especially among young people. Although there are existing techniques for cancer diagnosis, there is a need to explore more intelligent mechanisms that can not only identify the presence of cancer in cells but also determine the stage of cancer for timely treatment. This paper proposes a DL-based Lung Cell Cancer Detection (DL-LCCD) method that can accurately identify cancerous cells in lung tissue and determine their stage. The proposed DL-LCCD method employs digital image processing techniques and a Hybrid CNN model to identify cancer from CT scanned images with high accuracy and precision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results show that the classification accuracy achieved is 95.30% with tenfold cross-validation and 96.10% accuracy with 15-fold cross-validation.

AB The processing of brain images is useful in determining the brain diseases at early stages. In order to process images of brain for diagnosis of neurological problems, electroencephalogram (EEG) images play an important role. The extraction of features from the EEG images is a challenging task because the prognosis of neurological problems is based on the extraction of features from the EEG images and precision is must in diagnosis to identify the correct disease. Sometimes, there is a thin line in the features of diseases and smart mechanisms are required to identify the disease at early stage for saving the lives of diseased patients. Since brain is the most sensitive part of the human body which controls all the functions of the body and a delay in diagnosis of brain related diseases could be fatal for the patient. The intelligent methods which are using computational analysis and soft computing methods (evolutionary or swarm intelligence) to extract the features are to be explored for accurate diagnosis of brain problems from the EEG images. This paper is proposing a feature extraction (FE) method by combining two soft computing methods namely augmented-particle swarm optimization (A-PSO) and wavelet packet decomposition-common spatial patterns (WPD-CSP) for extraction of features. The proposed technique is working in four phases to develop the accurate results for correct diagnosis of the brain images for identifying the neurological diseases. The proposed method has been compared with benchmarked existing methods. The augmented PSO is also compared with traditional PSO. Experimental results from the subjects show that the proposed method can lead to classification accuracies of 2-12% higher than that of the benchmarked technique and the augmenting process get 5% benefit for the accuracy which is necessary for accurate diagnosis of EEG images. Meanwhile, the proposed method performs pretty well in classification accuracies. However, the proposed method only uses half EEG channels of CSP (common spatial patterns) which could benefit the practical rehabilitation application of brain computer interface.

AB With the continuous progress of the times, lung cancer has gradually emerged in people's lives, which has a significant impact on human health. Tumor targeting is mainly used to treat specific abnormal targets in human tumor cells or tissues, and eliminate tumor cell-specific lesions by blocking signal and metabolic pathways. In this article, we developed a new type of c-Met inhibitor, and analyzed its application in tumor therapy together with a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In this experiment, six compounds were screened, one of which was used as a positive control to evaluate the kinase inhibitory activity of candidate compounds. In this test, the dilution concentration grade, dilution gradient grade and porosity are taken as the dependent variables of each compound, and different results are obtained by adjusting each factor. The detection of c-Met kinase activity showed that c-Met inhibitors showed good kinase inhibitory activity. The results of inhibitory activity test showed that SIPI6931 compound on EGFR, KDR, c-Met kinase showed weak inhibitory activity, and had strong tolerance to SNU-5 cells combined with SIPI6931 compound cell activity. In this paper, the combination of new c-Met inhibitors and multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors has greatly promoted the development of tumor therapy.

AB At present, social production and people's lifestyle have been revolutionized and globally affected by the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology. This technology has been reasonably applied in many fields, such as medical treatment, economy, transportation and manufacturing, so it has been unanimously recognized and supported by the market, society and the government. At the same time, artificial intelligence is more and more applied to the field of cultural industry, which brings a new development model of cultural design creative industry and promotes its production and management reform. Based on this point, this paper focuses on the practical problems in the process of small sample single label classification of cultural and creative product images, comprehensively establishes the mainstream machine learning model, and classifies DPM data with mechanical transfer learning algorithm. From the experimental data, the prediction accuracy of the resnet50 model is 87%. Not only that, this paper also proposes a multifeature algorithm by integrating machine learning and deep learning technology, in order to solve the problem of differences between large and small types of cultural and creative products. The algorithm can combine convolution calculation and point combination for learning, so as to further improve the accuracy. Finally, it can realize that the accuracy is 5% higher than DPM data set, which is conducive to the development of cultural and creative industries. Through the in-depth analysis of artificial intelligence, it is found that the technical level of artificial intelligence needs to be improved at this stage, and there are limitations in its application; Artificial intelligence laws and regulations are imperfect and information protection is misplaced; Artificial intelligence technology is easy to be overused, which affects the healthy development of cultural industry and leads to public opinion. This paper applies machine learning and artificial skill technology to the field of cultural and creative design, so as to promote the development of cultural and creative industry.

AB The article aims to investigate the distance measure between any two conventional type trapezoidal-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (CTrVIFSs) whose membership and non-membership grades of an element are expressed as conventional trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (CTrIFN). Using the proposed distance measure, the similarity measure of CTrVIFSs is determined and its efficiency is shown by applying it to pattern recognition problems and MCDM problems. The similarity measure propounded in this article can be used to tackle real-world problems involving CTrVIFS as parameters, such as clustering, machine learning, and DNA matching. The application section discusses that this research can help decision-makers to recognize patterns and categorize samples with those patterns. Furthermore, the model of a real-world problem is given which utilizes the suggested similarity measure to solve MCDM problems, demonstrate the usability of the new technique and comprehend its applied intelligence above other methods. Finally, a general conclusion and future scope on this topic are discussed.

AB Recommender systems commonly encounter with the problems of data sparsity and cold start. Recently, social recommendation has emerged with the rapid expansion of social platforms, offering an opportunity to alleviate such two obstacles. Nevertheless, there are still two key limitations in existing studies. From the perspective of model design, previous social recommenders only consider the influence of a user's direct friends or uniformly treat the influences from different friends. From the perspective of model learning, most of them apply a sampling-based optimization strategy, which requires high-quality positive and negative samples. In light of the aforementioned limitations, we propose a new probabilistic method, named Graph Attentive Matrix Factorization (GAMF). Our method not only explicitly captures high-order social relationships, but also adopts an attention mechanism to automatically pick up different influences between friends. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to learn model parameters in a non-sampling manner. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets show the superiority of GAMF over state-of-the-art recommenders, especially under the cold start scenario.

DE image enhancement; image restoration; image representation
ID PHYSICAL MODEL
AB Underwater image enhancement for image processing and underwater robotic vision have recently attracted much academic attention. However, in most existing methods, underwater image enhancement is completed with a simple assumption: the attenuation coefficients are unified across the color channels. This assumption leads to unstable and visually unpleasing enhancement results. Moreover, these methods cannot be successfully applied to explore relatively independent transmissions from multiple color channels with complimentary feature information. To address these challenges, a novel channel-wise transmission estimation network (CTEN) is proposed, which aims to pioneer the exploration of the transmission difference across the color channels in an underwater scene. Specifically, a color-specific correction module is proposed to automatically quantify the transmission ability of multiple color channels in the underwater environment. Furthermore, a channel-wise transmission estimation module is designed to simultaneously explore the relative independence of multi-color channels and estimate the medium transmissions for each color channel, which represents the attenuation degree of different color radiances after reflecting in the water. Then, a novel residual strategy is introduced to integrate these two modules to complete the underwater enhancement. Using the model, the authors are able to provide an answer as to why channel-wise transmission estimation are better than single transmission estimation and establish a generalization theory to show the effect of the independent transmission estimation model for each color channel. Experiments on several underwater image datasets verify the superiority of the proposed CTEN model.

AB The semantic information can ensure better pixel classification, and the spatial information of the low-level feature map can ensure the detailed location of the pixels. However, this part of spatial information is often ignored in capturing semantic information, it is a huge loss for the spatial location of the image semantic category itself. To better alleviate this problem, we propose a Long and Short-Range Relevance Context Network. Specifically, we first construct a Long-Range Relevance Context Module to capture the global semantic context of the high-level feature and the ignored local spatial context information. At the same time, we build a Short-Range Relevance Context Module to capture the piecewise spatial context information in each stage of the low-level features in the form of jump connections. The whole network adopts a coding and decoding structure to better improve the segmentation results. Finally, we conduct a large number of experiments on three semantic segmentation datasets (PASCAL VOC2012, Cityscapes and ADE20K datasets) to verify the effectiveness of the network.

AB Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of study that focuses on data analysis on texts with certain methods. NLP includes tasks such as sentiment analysis, spam detection, entity linking, and question answering, to name a few. Entity linking is an NLP task that is used to map mentions specified in the text to the entities of a Knowledge Base. In this study, we analysed the efficacy of bi-encoder entity linking models for multilingual biomedical texts. Using surface-based, approximate nearest neighbour search and embedding approaches during the candidate generation phase, accuracy, and recall values were measured on language representation models such as BERT, SapBERT, BioBERT, and RoBERTa according to language and domain. The proposed entity linking framework was analysed on the BC5CDR and Cantemist datasets for English and Spanish, respectively. The framework achieved 76.75% accuracy for the BC5CDR and 60.19% for the Cantemist. In addition, the proposed framework was compared with previous studies. The results highlight the challenges that come with domain-specific multilingual datasets.

AB Conventional graph-based dimensionality reduction methods treat graph leaning and subspace learning as two separate steps, and fix the graph during subspace learning. However, the graph obtained from the original data may be not optimal, because the original high-dimensional data contains redundant information and noise, thus the subsequent subspace learning based on the graph may be affected. In this paper, we propose a model called adaptive affinity matrix learning (AAML) for unsupervised dimensionality reduction. Different from traditional graph-based methods, we integrate two steps into a unified framework and adaptively adjust the learned graph. To obtain an ideal neighbor assignment, we introduce a rank constraint to the Laplacian matrix of the affinity matrix. In this way, the number of connected components of the graph is exactly equal to the number of class numbers. By approximating two low-dimensional subspaces, the affinity matrix can obtain the original neighbor structure from the similarity matrix, and the projection matrix can get low-rank information from the affinity matrix, then a distinctive subspace can be learned. Moreover, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the optimization problem of AAML. Experimental results on four data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

DE Moral foundations; Natural language processing; Semantic similarity;
   Word embedding
AB Morality is a topic that people are increasingly concerned about. Morality is observed and measured during public acts or when developing and consuming products, such as movies. The Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) was developed to rigorously perform these measurements with the support of the Moral Foundations Dictionary (MFD). In this paper, a Word Embedding-based Moral Foundation Assignment (WEMFA) approach has been designed, implemented, and applied to the movie domain for multiple assignment of moral foundations. WEMFA may use any dictionary, and it has been applied to a movie collection generated from movie synopses. A comparison between WEMFA and MoralStrength, the only approach found in the scientific literature, has been carried out. The proposed approach provided a percentage improvement of 41.7% with respect to the best version of MoralStrength, which uses an extension of the original MFD almost 10 times larger in number of terms. In addition, an extension of the original MFD (MFD24) has been built by adding 14 new moral foundations to the 10 original ones, enriching the moral context. WEMFA provided a mean accuracy of 78% with MFD24 despite the increment of the number of moral foundations. Besides, new extended dictionaries or even totally different ones can be used with WEMFA, since it does not need any training.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Parallel computing is the main way to improve the computational efficiency of metaheuristic algorithms for solving high-dimensional, nonlinear optimization problems. Previous studies have typically only implemented local parallelism for the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In this study, we proposed a new parallel particle swarm optimization algorithm (GPU-PSO) based on the Graphics Processing Units (GPU) and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which uses a combination of coarse-grained parallelism and fine-grained parallelism to achieve global parallelism. In addition, we designed a data structure based on CUDA features and utilized a merged memory access mode to further improve data-parallel processing and data access efficiency. Experimental results show that the algorithm effectively reduces the solution time of PSO for solving high-dimensional, large-scale optimization problems. The speedup ratio increases with the dimensionality of the objective function, where the speedup ratio is up to 2000 times for the high-dimensional Ackley function. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.
