AB Although virtual reality (VR) training provides a realistic environment that offers an immersive experience for learners, it can affect the training progress by triggering a cognitive load or distracting learners from focusing on the main content of the training. In this study, the application of a gaze visualization interface to a medical safety training system was proposed to prevent learner distraction, which is an issue usually experienced in traditional VR training systems. An experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of applying the gaze visualization interface to a medical training system on the learning performance. Based on related studies, the following three metrics were selected to evaluate the learning performance: learning flow, achievement, and concentration. After the experiment, flow and achievement were evaluated through surveys and quizzes. These evaluation methods can also distort learners' memories, making it difficult to analyze objective learning outcomes. Eye-tracking technology is useful for measuring learning performance in multimedia learning environments and can represent learner's eye movements in objective metrics. Therefore, in this study, eye-tracking technology was used to evaluate concentration. The experimental results suggest that the gaze visualization interface had positive effects on learners' concentration, learning flow, and achievement.

AB The software development industry has evolved in recent years, presenting new challenges. In this scenario, software ecosystems have emerged as a new development paradigm through which external contributors support software production by providing solutions that complement a common ecosystem platform. Due to the many technologies, frameworks, and domains that an ecosystem can host, many collaborators acquainted with various domain topics and skills have also come into play. Recruiting collaborators becomes complex due to the varying degrees of knowledge and skills each collaborator has and their multiple competencies. There is a need to support the decision-making in the collaborator's recruitment, using the knowledge related to their skills. This work presents a solution supported by an ontology capable of recommending external collaborators for specific projects. The solution encompasses an architecture based on semantic models and expertise retrieval techniques. The architecture scores the collaborators' level of knowledge about topics and provides contextual information for the recommendation. Two studies were conducted involving two real software ecosystem platforms (Node.js and E-SECO). Results reveal that our approach can (i) use semantic models and inference mechanisms, (ii) offer context information essential for recruiter decision-making, and (iii) support recruiter' decision on contributor selection.

AB Automated urine sediment analysis has become an essential part of diagnosing, monitoring, and treating various diseases that affect the urinary tract and kidneys. However, manual analysis of urine sediment is time-consuming and prone to human bias, and hence there is a need for an automated urine sediment analysis systems using machine learning algorithms. In this work, we propose Swin-LBP, a handcrafted urine sediment classification model using the Swin transformer architecture and local binary pattern (LBP) technique to achieve high classification performance. The Swin-LBP model comprises five phases: preprocessing of input images using shifted windows-based patch division, six-layered LBP-based feature extraction, neighborhood component analysis-based feature selection, support vector machine-based calculation of six predicted vectors, and mode function-based majority voting of the six predicted vectors to generate four additional voted vectors. Our newly reconstructed urine sediment image dataset, consisting of 7 distinct classes, was utilized for training and testing our model. Our proposed model has several advantages over existing automated urinalysis systems. Firstly, we used a feature engineering model that enables high classification performance with linear complexity. This means that it can provide accurate results quickly and efficiently, making it an attractive alternative to time-consuming and biased manual urine sediment analysis. Additionally, our model outperformed existing deep learning models developed on the same source urine sediment image dataset, indicating its superiority in urine sediment classification. Our model achieved 92.60% accuracy for 7-class urine sediment classification, with an average precision of 92.05%. These results demonstrate that the proposed Swin-LBP model can provide a reliable and efficient solution for the diagnosis, surveillance, and therapeutic monitoring of various diseases affecting the kidneys and urinary tract. The proposed model's accuracy, speed, and efficiency make it an attractive option for clinical laboratories and healthcare facilities. In conclusion, the Swin-LBP model has the potential to revolutionize urine sediment analysis and improve patient outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract and kidney diseases.

AB Adversarial examples are artificially crafted to mislead deep learning systems into making wrong decisions. In the research of attack algorithms against multi-class image classifiers, an improved strategy of applying category explanation to the generation control of targeted adversarial example is proposed to reduce the perturbation noise and improve the adversarial robustness. On the basis of C & W adversarial attack algorithm, the method uses Grad-Cam, a category visualization explanation algorithm of CNN, to dynamically obtain the salient regions according to the signal features of source and target categories during the iterative generation process. The adversarial example of non-global perturbation is finally achieved by gradually shielding the non-salient regions and fine-tuning the perturbation signals. Compared with other similar algorithms under the same conditions, the method enhances the effects of the original image category signal on the perturbation position. And it makes up for the shortcomings of the adversarial example algorithm in terms of interpretability and teaching intuitiveness. Experimental results show that the improved adversarial examples have higher PSNR. In addition, in a variety of different defense processing tests, the examples can keep high adversarial performance and show strong attacking robustness.

AB The random structures in the Aquila optimization algorithm are modeled with fractional chaotic oscillators, and the fractional-order chaotic oscillator-based Aquila optimization (FOCOBAO) algorithm was suggested in this study. First of all, the basic AO algorithm was examined. In particular, random variables that affect the optimization performance of the AO algorithm have been determined. Then, instead of the determined random variables, the coefficients were derived with fractional chaotic oscillators and used in the FOCOBAO. The superiority of the proposed algorithm was primarily demonstrated via twenty-three benchmark functions. The results were matched with GO, EO, GWO, MPA, WOA, SMA and basic AO optimization algorithms. Then, the design of the Lorenz chaotic oscillator, according to maximum chaotic objective function, is a topic that remains up to date in the literature. In this study, a fractional chaotic Lorenz oscillator was designed with FOCOBAO as an engineering application. Especially for maximum chaoticity, maximum positive Lyapunov exponents were determined. In this way, a different design process has been proposed in the literature. The basic AO algorithm, which includes stochastic processes, was developed with fractional chaotic oscillators, and a deterministic method was obtained. The parameters of the Lorenz system were calculated for maximum chaoticity, and the results were presented comparatively.

AB Since much emphasis has been put on the eco-friendly manufacturing process in industries, and the complex changes in market demands, this paper focuses on a green scheduling problem of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The studied FMS consists of multi-FMCs (flexible manufacturing cells) which have many material handling needs with time constraints. Distinguished from other AGV scheduling problems in FMS, this paper concentrates on the pickup and delivery operations or even bi-handling requirements of AGVs for FMCs, ignoring the inner production process within them. To solve this problem, a bi-objective mathematical model is built trying to minimize the total tardiness and energy consumption of AGVs simultaneously. Some properties of the problem and a no-collision algorithm are developed for the potential conflicts among AGVs. Due to the NP-hard nature of the proposed problem, a hyper-heuristic (HH) algorithm based on a double deep Q network (DDQN) is introduced, which benefits from the structures of double decision networks and multi-operator. To improve the performance of the proposed algorithm, the experience pool is used to increase the convergence speed and the crowding distance, and the non-dominated sorting strategies are presented to decide the acceptance of the new generation. Besides, in the DDQN, the states and rewards of agents are designed based on the characteristics of the scheduling problem. Finally, many experiments have been conducted and the computational results reveal that the proposed DDQN-HH algorithm outperforms the other two compared algorithms in both the convergence speed and quality of solutions.

AB To solve optimization problems in real-time and robustly, we propose a piecewise dynamic network for solving convex programming constrained by inequalities and linear equalities. The network is proposed based on the penalty method and includes two stages. The network in the first stage is a zeroing dynamic network to solve an equation. It makes sure that for any initial point, the state of the network enters the linear equality constraint set within a fixed time. The optimal solution to this convex programming is obtained by the network in the second stage which is a gradient-type dynamic network. A lower bound of the penalty parameter is given to ensure the validity of the network, which makes up for the deficiency of the existing works. A suitable activation function is introduced to promote fixed-time convergence of the network and to improve its anti-interference capability. As a result, the proposed piecewise dynamic network is robust against additional interferences. Some tests are presented to show the effectiveness of our network.

AB Two significant issues in biosensors that can't be solved by conventional analytical methods are selectivity among likely biological interfering molecules and background noise in clinical samples. The application of embedded machine learning in the removal of background interference, which is extremely common in complex matrix solutions such as cerebrospinal fluid, is still unexplored. The implementation of machine learning into devices and sensors can enhance their reliability to discriminate responses. In addition, implementing these models into portable devices can further improve the usage of point-of-care devices, continuous monitoring, and viral mutation assessments. Herein, the requirements to implement an embedded AI model (TinyML) into low-power portable systems and its use in the electrochemical field are presented. The application of TinyML to discriminate between interference of uric acid and ascorbic acid, both well-known abundant electrochemically active species, in neurotransmitter detection, is explored, reaching overall accuracy of 98.1% for 32-bit float point unit and 96.01% after 8-bit quantization, with the usage of 4.55% of the custom-made potentiostat memory. The model can be improved simply by having the trade-off between memory and accuracy.

AB In this article, a novel approach to enhance the maneuverability and adaptability of legged robots in challenging environments is proposed. This approach involves the integration of soft inflatable sensing skin, which provides additional mobile modes and environmental adaptability. The inflated skin's structural properties, such as buoyancy, volumed shape, and physical compliance, enable quadruped robots to extend their mobility to stable swimming and crawling modes. The inflated skin also offers physical protection through cushioning and backing effects, allowing robots to roll down stair-like structures. Furthermore, the integration of tactile sensors provides the host robot with accurate and intuitive contact information, enabling increased environmental adaptability and responsive behavior. The robot can protect itself from impacts, detect and detour obstacles, and dynamically interact with its surrounding environment. Overall, the proposed approach offers a synergistic integration of soft inflatable sensing skin and tactile sensors to enhance legged robots' maneuverability and adaptability in harsh environments. The integrated system enables robots to achieve challenging missions, extending their capabilities beyond conventional locomotive modes. The proposed approach has significant potential applications in fields such as search and rescue, surveillance, and exploration.

AB This study addresses the challenge of intelligent decision-making for command-and-control systems in air defense combat operations. Current autonomous decision-making systems suffer from limited rationality and insufficient intelligence during operation processes. Recent studies have proposed methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address these issues. However, DRL methods typically face challenges related to weak interpretability, lack of convergence guarantees, and high-computing power requirements. To address these issues, a novel technique for large-scale air defense decision-making by combining a DRL technique with game theory is discussed. The proposed method transforms the target assignment problem into a potential game that provides theoretical guarantees for Nash equilibrium (NE) from a distributed perspective. The air-defense decision problem is decomposed into separate target selection and target assignment problems. A DRL method is used to solve the target selection problem, while the target assignment problem is translated into a target assignment optimization game. This game is proven to be an exact potential game with theoretical convergence guarantees for an NE. Having simulated the proposed decision-making method using a digital battlefield environment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.

AB This paper proposes a multi-attribute group decision-making methodology that takes advantage of a new weighted geometric mean aggregation operator on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs). To this purpose, first, we define the intuitionistic fuzzy direct weighted geometric operator on IFNs, then we prove that it is a representable intuitionistic aggregation operator, and afterwards, we compare it with other aggregation operators motivated by the geometric mean. We use two proxies for the quantitative comparison of performances, namely the average of the Euclidean distances to the IFNs and the sum of squared error inspired by the k-means clustering algorithm.

AB In edge-enabled Internet of Things (IoT), Quality of Experience (QoE)-guaranteed offloading decision is to decide which IoT tasks can be offloaded to edge servers with QoE guarantee. Centralized QoE-guaranteed offloading decision methods construct a global decision model for all IoT tasks with complete information. However, centralized offloading decision methods entail collecting global information from IoT devices, edge servers, and network environment, which may not be practical in large-scale distributed edge-enabled IoT environments, and it is unrealistic for privacy-critical and heterogeneous IoT tasks in many real-world edge-enabled IoT systems, where IoT devices may refuse to expose their private information and heterogeneous IoT tasks may have different QoE requirements, these issues make the application of centralized offloading decision method limited. To address these limitations, we propose a distributed offloading decision method which enables each IoT device to make decisions by partially observable global information in a decentralized manner. The distributed offloading decision process is modeled as a multi-agent partially observable Markov decision process, and a novel model-free deep reinforcement learning-based distributed algorithm named GRU Fictitious Self-Play Dueling Double Deep Recurrent Q Network(GFSP-D3RQN) is introduced to solve the problem. Furthermore, we measure the QoE of each IoT device based on a combination of latency and energy consumption, which are weighted differently according to the individual preferences of each IoT device, using a non-dimensionalized adjustment to accommodate the varying requirements of these IoT devices. Extensive simulation results show that our algorithm can achieve a higher average QoE and higher success ratio compared with baseline algorithms, which improved by at least 6.38% and 5.91%, respectively.

AB The Besicovitch pseudometric is a shift-invariant pseudometric over the set of infinite sequences, that enjoys interesting properties and is suitable for studying the dynamics of cellular automata. It corresponds to the asymptotic behavior of the Hamming distance on longer and longer prefixes. Though dynamics of cellular automata were already studied in the literature, we propose the first study of the dynamics of substitutions. We characterize those that yield a well-defined dynamical system as essentially the uniform ones. We also explore a variant of this pseudometric, the Feldman-Katok pseudometric, where the Hamming distance is replaced by the Levenshtein distance. Like in the Besicovitch space, cellular automata are Lipschitz in this space, but here also all substitutions are Lipschitz. In both spaces, we discuss equicontinuity of these systems, give a number of examples, and generalize our results to the class of dill maps, that embeds both cellular automata and substitutions.

AB Although current time-series forecasting methods have significantly improved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for long-sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF), they still have difficulty in capturing and extracting the features and dependencies of long-term sequences and suffer from information utilization bottlenecks and high-computational complexity. To address these issues, a lightweight single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) combining convolution mapping and time-frequency decomposition called CTFNet is proposed with three distinctive characteristics. First, time-domain (TD) feature mining-in this article, a method for extracting the long-term correlation of horizontal TD features based on matrix factorization is proposed, which can effectively capture the interdependence among different sample points of a long time series. Second, multitask frequency-domain (FD) feature mining-this can effectively extract different frequency feature information of time-series data from the FD and minimize the loss of data features. Integrating multiscale dilated convolutions, simultaneously focusing on both global and local context feature dependencies at the sequence level, and mining the long-term dependencies of the multiscale frequency information and the spatial dependencies among the different scale frequency information, break the bottleneck of data utilization, and ensure the integrity of feature extraction. Third, highly efficient-the CTFNet model has a short training time and fast inference speed. Our empirical studies with nine benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, CTFNet can reduce prediction error by 64.7% and 53.7% for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

AB Training deep neural network classifiers for electrocardiograms (ECGs) requires sufficient data. However, imbalanced datasets pose a major problem for the training process and hence data augmentation is commonly performed. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can create synthetic ECG data to augment such imbalanced datasets. This review aims at identifying the present literature concerning synthetic ECG signal generation using GANs to provide a comprehensive overview of architectures, quality evaluation metrics, and classification performances. Thirty publications from the years 2019 to 2022 were selected from three separate databases. Nine publications used a quality evaluation metric neglecting classification, eleven performed a classification but omitted a quality evaluation metric, and ten publications performed both. Twenty different quality evaluation metrics were observed. Overall, the classification performance of databases augmented with synthetically created ECG signals increased by 7 % to 98 % in accuracy and 6 % to 97 % in sensitivity. In conclusion, synthetic ECG signal generation using GANs represents a promising tool for data augmentation of imbalanced datasets. Consistent quality evaluation of generated signals remains challenging. Hence, future work should focus on the establishment of a gold standard for quality evaluation metrics for GANs.

TI Hierarchically Contrastive Hard Sample Mining for Graph Self-Supervised

DE Contrastive learning; graph self-supervised pretraining (GSP); hard
   sample mining; multiview learning; mutual information (MI)
AB Contrastive learning has recently emerged as a powerful technique for graph self-supervised pretraining (GSP). By maximizing the mutual information (MI) between a positive sample pair, the network is forced to extract discriminative information from graphs to generate high-quality sample representations. However, we observe that, in the process of MI maximization (Infomax), the existing contrastive GSP algorithms suffer from at least one of the following problems: 1) treat all samples equally during optimization and 2) fall into a single contrasting pattern within the graph. Consequently, the vast number of well-categorized samples overwhelms the representation learning process, and limited information is accumulated, thus deteriorating the learning capability of the network. To solve these issues, in this article, by fusing the information from different views and conducting hard sample mining in a hierarchically contrastive manner, we propose a novel GSP algorithm called hierarchically contrastive hard sample mining (HCHSM). The hierarchical property of this algorithm is manifested in two aspects. First, according to the results of multilevel MI estimation in different views, the MI-based hard sample selection (MHSS) module keeps filtering the easy nodes and drives the network to focus more on hard nodes. Second, to collect more comprehensive information for hard sample learning, we introduce a hierarchically contrastive scheme to sequentially force the learned node representations to involve multilevel intrinsic graph features. In this way, as the contrastive granularity goes finer, the complementary information from different levels can be uniformly encoded to boost the discrimination of hard samples and enhance the quality of the learned graph embedding. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets indicate that the HCHSM performs better than other competitors on node classification and node clustering tasks.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB Meta-heuristics can provide high-quality solutions to challenging problems in a reasonable amount of time, but are highly sensitive to the values assigned to their control parameters. The parameter configuration landscape (PCL) offers insight into the characteristics associated with optimisation of the parameter configuration of a meta-heuristic, but is poorly understood for most meta-heuristics. Further exacerbating this issue, determining the characteristics of the PCL is an extremely computationally expensive process. This study proposes the usage of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as surrogate models to greatly reduce the computational burden associated with characterising the PCL. Notably, this study represents the first usage of surrogate models in PCL research. Furthermore, this study presents a characterisation of the PCLs for both particle swarm optimization (PSO) and differential evolution (DE) employing ANN surrogate models, using five well-established fitness landscape analysis (FLA) metrics, and finds that the common assumption of correlation between the fitness and distance of control parameter settings is not strictly met. Overall, the training and usage of the surrogate models leads to a 99.86% reduction in the number of algorithm executions required to attain the PCL samples used in the characterisation. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Wind turbines have become one of the essential sources of energy generation due to their contribution to energy security, economic development, job creation, and technological innovation. This work proposes a methodology for designing robust fault diagnosis systems based on a bank of zonotopic state estimators built upon Takagi-Sugeno (TS) models. The TS models with associated parametric uncertainty are obtained using a Multiple Output Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS), an extended and improved version of single-input, single-output ANFIS. Its main difference is its multi-output architecture, which allows generalized weighting functions to be obtained, reducing training times, uncertainties estimation, and reduced complexity. As a result, a set of Linear Matrix Inequalities is obtained with the it & INFIN; criterion to adjust the parameter of the zonotopic estimator considering the modeling uncertainty. Overall, the work contributes to improving the safety of WT through diagnostic methods that improve its operability. A well-known certified reference case study of a wind turbine system is considered to validate the proposed method.

AB Cover crops are a critical agricultural practice that can improve soil quality, enhance crop yields, and reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses from farms. Yet there is limited understanding of the extent to which cover crops have been adopted across large spatial and temporal scales. Remote sensing offers a low-cost way to monitor cover crop adoption at the field scale and at large spatio-temporal scales. To date, most studies using satellite data have mapped the presence of cover crops, but have not identified specific cover crop species, which is important because cover crops of different plant functional types (e.g., legumes, grasses) perform different ecosystem functions. Here we use Sentinel-2 satellite data and a random forest classifier to map the cover crop species cereal rye and red clover, which represent grass and legume functional types, in the River Raisin watershed in southeastern Michigan. Our maps of agricultural landcover across this region, including the two cover crop species, had moderate to high accuracies, with an overall accuracy of 83%. Red clover and cereal rye achieved F1 scores that ranged from 0.7 to 0.77, and user's and producer's accuracies that ranged from 63.3% to 86.2%. The most common misclassification of cover crops was fallow fields with remaining crop stubble, which often looked similar because these cover crop species are typically planted within existing crop stubble, or interseeded into a grain crop. We found that red-edge bands and images from the end of April and early July were the most important for classification accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential to map individual cover crop species using Sentinel-2 imagery, which is critical for understanding the environmental outcomes of increasing crop diversity on farms.

ID MULTISCALE
AB Recognizing occluded facial expressions in the wild poses a significant challenge. However, most previous approaches rely solely on either global or local feature-based methods, leading to the loss of relevant expression features. To address these issues, a feature fusion residual attention network (FFRA-Net) is proposed. FFRA-Net consists of a multi-scale module, a local attention module, and a feature fusion module. The multi-scale module divides the intermediate feature map into several sub-feature maps in an equal manner along the channel dimension. Then, a convolution operation is applied to each of these feature maps to obtain diverse global features. The local attention module divides the intermediate feature map into several sub-feature maps along the spatial dimension. Subsequently, a convolution operation is applied to each of these feature maps, resulting in the extraction of local key features through the attention mechanism. The feature fusion module plays a crucial role in integrating global and local expression features while also establishing residual links between inputs and outputs to compensate for the loss of fine-grained features. Last, two occlusion expression datasets (FM_RAF-DB and SG_RAF-DB) were constructed based on the RAF-DB dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FFRA-Net achieves excellent results on four datasets: FM_RAF-DB, SG_RAF-DB, RAF-DB, and FERPLUS, with accuracies of 77.87%, 79.50%, 88.66%, and 88.97%, respectively. Thus, the approach presented in this paper demonstrates strong applicability in the context of occluded facial expression recognition (FER).

AB Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) help achieve brain-like efficiency and functionality by building neurons and synapses that mimic the human brain's transmission of electrical signals. However, optimal SNN implementation requires a precise balance of parametric values. To design such ubiquitous neural networks, a graphical tool for visualizing, analyzing, and explaining the internal behavior of spikes is crucial. Although some popular SNN simulators are available, these tools do not allow users to interact with the neural network during simulation. To this end, we have introduced the first runtime interactive simulator, called Runtime Analyzing and Visualization Simulator (RAVSim),(a) developed to analyze and dynamically visualize the behavior of SNNs, allowing end-users to interact, observe output concentration reactions, and make changes directly during the simulation. In this paper, we present RAVSim with the current implementation of runtime interaction using the LIF neural model with different connectivity schemes, an image classification model using SNNs, and a dataset creation feature. Our main objective is to primarily investigate binary classification using SNNs with RGB images. We created a feed-forward network using the LIF neural model for an image classification algorithm and evaluated it by using RAVSim. The algorithm classifies faces with and without masks, achieving an accuracy of 91.8% using 1000 neurons in a hidden layer, 0.0758 MSE, and an execution time of similar to 10min on the CPU. The experimental results show that using RAVSim not only increases network design speed but also accelerates user learning capability.

AB Expert assessments with pre-defined numerical or language terms can limit the scope of decision-making models. We propose that decision-making models can incorporate expert judgments expressed in natural language through sentiment analysis. To help make more informed choices, we present the Sentiment Analysis in Recommender Systems with Multi-person, Multi-criteria Decision Making (SAR-MCMD) method. This method compiles the opinions of several experts by analyzing their written reviews and, if applicable, their star ratings. The growth of online applications and the sheer amount of available information have made it difficult for users to decide which information or products to select from the Internet. Intelligent decision-support technologies, known as recommender systems, leverage users' preferences to suggest what they might find interesting. Recommender systems are one of the many approaches to dealing with information overload issues. These systems have traditionally relied on single-grading algorithms to predict and communicate users' opinions for observed items. To boost their predictive and recommendation abilities, multi-criteria recommender systems assign numerous ratings to various qualities of products. We created, manually annotated, and released the technique in a case study of restaurant selection using 'TripAdvisor reviews', 'TMDB 5000 movies', and an 'Amazon dataset'. In various areas, cutting-edge deep learning approaches have led to breakthrough progress. Recently, researchers have begun to focus on applying these methods to recommendation systems, and different deep learning-based recommendation models have been suggested. Due to its proficiency with sparse data in large data systems and its ability to construct complex models that characterize user performance for the recommended procedure, deep learning is a formidable tool. In this article, we introduce a model for a multi-criteria recommender system that combines the best of both deep learning and multi-criteria decision-making. According to our findings, the suggested system may give customers very accurate suggestions with a sentiment analysis accuracy of 98%. Additionally, the metrics, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are where the system truly shines, much above what has been achieved in the past.

AB We study potential biases of popular network clustering quality metrics, such as those based on the dichotomy between internal and external connectivity. We propose a method that uses both stochastic and preferential attachment block models construction to generate networks with preset community structures, and Poisson or scale-free degree distribution, to which quality metrics will be applied. These models also allow us to generate multi-level structures of varying strength, which will show if metrics favour partitions into a larger or smaller number of clusters. Additionally, we propose another quality metric, the density ratio. We observed that most of the studied metrics tend to favour partitions into a smaller number of big clusters, even when their relative internal and external connectivity are the same. The metrics found to be less biased are modularity and density ratio.

AB Text classification is an important and classic application in natural language processing (NLP). Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective in tasks with rich structural relationships and serve as effective transductive learning approaches. Text representation learning methods based on large-scale pretraining can learn implicit but rich semantic information from text. However, few studies have comprehensively utilized the contextual semantic and structural information for Chinese text classification. Moreover, the existing GNN methods for text classification did not consider the applicability of their graph construction methods to long or short texts. In this work, we propose Chinese-BERTology-wwm-GCN, a framework that combines Chinese bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) series models with whole word masking (Chinese-BERTology-wwm) and the graph convolutional network (GCN) for Chinese text classification. When building text graph, we use documents and words as nodes to construct a heterogeneous graph for the entire corpus. Specifically, we use the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to construct the word-document edge weights. For long text corpora, we propose an improved pointwise mutual information (PMI & DBLBOND;) measure for words according to their word co-occurrence distances to represent the weights of word-word edges. For short text corpora, the co-occurrence information between words is often limited. Therefore, we utilize cosine similarity to represent the word-word edge weights. During the training stage, we effectively combine the cross-entropy and hinge losses and use them to jointly train Chinese-BERTology-wwm and GCN. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the baselines on three Chinese benchmark datasets and achieves good performance even with few labeled training sets.

AB Rapid developments in automatic driving technology have given rise to new experiences for passengers. Safety is a main priority in automatic driving. A strong familiarity with road-surface conditions during the day and night is essential to ensuring driving safety. Existing models used for recognizing road-surface conditions lack the required robustness and generalization abilities. Most studies only validated the performance of these models on daylight images. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-supervised bidirectional fusion network (MBFN) model to detect weather-induced road-surface conditions on the path of automatic vehicles at both daytime and nighttime. We employed ConvNeXt to extract the basic features, which were further processed using a new bidirectional fusion module to create a fused feature. Then, the basic and fused features were concatenated to generate a refined feature with greater discriminative and generalization abilities. Finally, we designed a multi-supervised loss function to train the MBFN model based on the extracted features. Experiments were conducted using two public datasets. The results clearly demonstrated that the MBFN model could classify diverse road surface conditions, such as dry, wet, and snowy conditions, with a satisfactory accuracy and outperform state-of-the-art baseline models. Notably, the proposed model has multiple variants that could also achieve competitive performances under different road conditions. The code for the MBFN model is shared at https://zenodo. org/badge/latestdoi/607014079.

AB Relation extraction is an important topic in information extraction, as it is used to create large-scale knowledge graphs for a variety of downstream applications. Its goal is to find and extract semantic links between entity pairs in natural language sentences. Deep learning has substantially advanced neural relation extraction, allowing for the autonomous learning of semantic features. We offer an effective Chinese relation extraction model that uses bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) and an attention mechanism to extract crucial semantic information from phrases without relying on domain knowledge from lexical resources or language systems in this study. The attention mechanism included into the Bi-LSTM network allows for automatic focus on key words. Two benchmark datasets were used to create and test our models: Chinese SanWen and FinRE. The experimental results show that the SanWen dataset model outperforms the FinRE dataset model, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.70 and 0.50, respectively. The models trained on the SanWen and FinRE datasets achieve values of 0.44 and 0.19, respectively, for the area under the precision-recall curve. In addition, the results of repeated modeling experiments indicated that our proposed method was robust and reproducible.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Differentiable architecture search; exclusive competition; channel
   attention; progressive partial channel connections
AB Neural architecture search has attracted great attention in the research community and has been successfully applied in the industry recently. Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) is an efficient architecture search method. However, the networks searched by DARTS are often unstable due to the large gap in the architecture depth between the search phase and the verification phase. In addition, due to unfair exclusive competition between different candidate operations, DARTS is prone to skip connection aggregation, which may cause performance collapse. In this article, we propose progressive partial channel connections based on channel attention for differentiable architecture search (PA-DARTS) to solve the above problems. In the early stage of searching, we only select a few key channels for convolution using channel attention and reserve all candidate operations. As the search progresses, we gradually increase the number of channels and eliminate unpromising candidate operations to ensure that the search phase and verification phase are all carried out on 20 cells. Due to the existence of the partial channel connections based on channel attention, we can eliminate the unfair competition between operations and increase the stability of PA-DARTS. Experimental results showed that PA-DARTS could achieve 97.59% and 83.61% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively. On ImageNet, our algorithm achieved 75.3% classification accuracy.

AB The evaluation of the capability of network-based systems of systems has replaced the simple method that considers return on investment, becoming a new paradigm for planning national defence capabilities. However, the dual uncertainty of the key system attributes of scenes and weapons has brought great challenges for decision-making. Based on this, we developed a multiobjective optimization model with multiple stages and scenarios under uncertainty to determine plans. In this study, we consider planning risk and planning cost as the two objectives. To solve this problem, we propose a hybrid solution for a network-based optimization method integrated with fuzzy set theory. The network-based optimization method combines the NSGA-II-DE and complex network theory. We use the characteristics of the network to evaluate the capabilities of the WSoS, and the NSGA-II-DE is used to generate a development plan and finally output a set of Pareto optimal solutions. We use fuzzy sets to determine the fuzzy membership of each plan on the Pareto front and determine a satisfactory solution. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments to verify the rationality of the methods proposed in this article. The results can provide a set of efficient solutions for military planners, helping generate a variety of planning solutions and trade-offs according to their preferences.

AB This study presents the design of an underwater superlimb as a wearable robot, providing divers with mobility assistance and freeing their hands for manipulating tools underwater. The wearable design features a thrust vectoring system with two 3D-printed, waterproofed modules. The module with adjustable connections and strapping holes is designed to enable reconfiguration for multiple purposes, including regular use as an underwater superlimb for divers, manually operated as a handheld glider for swimmers, combined with an amphibian, legged robot as a quadruped superlimb, and coupled as a dual-unit autonomous underwater vehicle for underwater navigation. The kinematics and dynamics of the prototype and all of its reconfigured modes are developed. A sliding-mode controller is also introduced to achieve stable simulation in PyBullet. Field tests further support the feasibility of the underwater superlimb when worn on a test diver in a swimming pool. As the first underwater superlimb presented in the literature, this study opens new doors for supernumerary robotic limbs in underwater scenarios with multifunctional reconfiguration.

AB One of the most important barriers towards a widespread use of mobile robots in unstructured, human populated and possibly a-priori unknown work environments is the ability to plan a safe path. In this paper, we propose to delegate this activity to a human operator that walks in front of the robot marking with her/his footsteps the path to be followed. The implementation of this approach requires a high degree of robustness in locating the specific person to be followed (the path-finder). We propose a three phases approach to fulfil this goal: 1. Identification and tracking of the person in the image space, 2. Sensor fusion between camera data and laser sensors, 3. Point interpolation with continuous curvature paths. The approach is described in the paper and extensively validated with experimental results.

AB Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can find a set of Pareto solutions to the multi-objective optimization problem. However, it is still a challenge for the decision-maker to understand the relationship between various Pareto solutions and pick up the really preferred solution. This article proposes an objective extraction method to simplify the many-objective solution set by reducing the objective dimensionality but keeping the dominance and distribution relationships between solutions. First, a sparse regularized self-representation (SRSR) model is developed to learn the linear relationship among objectives, in which all objectives are determined by a set of base ones. Second, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is constructed to solve such a model. Finally, an objective extraction method (SRSR-OE) that can preserve the dominance and distribution relationships between solutions is invented by exploiting the learned relationship. Experimental results show that our SRSR model and ADMM algorithm are efficient for extracting the linear objective relationship, and the developed objective extraction method also has advantages over some state-of-the-art ones in preserving dominance and distribution relationships between solutions after solution set simplification.

AB The mental health of college students not only affects their personal development but also impacts the environment of the campus. Moreover, it affects the harmony of the family and stability of the society. This phenomenon has attracted great attention from the society. New technological paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and data mining offer new opportunities to detect, assess, and care for the mental health of students early. This paper explains the psychological problems of college students and analyzes the application of IoT and data mining in the mental health of students. The contents of mental health in colleges are investigated, and big data techniques are employed to build an innovative model for students. First, an online psychological consulting platform is designed followed by online evaluation standards and online/offline teaching fusion courses to understand mental health. Next, a neural network algorithm is developed and trained on the datasets to accurately classify the contents of students' mental health, and the corresponding results are obtained. The model is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Results show that the proposed innovative model achieves better results with 88% accuracy. Through comparative analysis, it is demonstrated that the use of IoT and big data technology can provide technical support for the innovation of college student's mental health and education and can solve more problems efficiently.

AB Video analysis of human motion has been widely used in intelligent monitoring, motion recognition, and virtual reality as a research hotspot in computer vision. Dance is a classic form of human motion that is usually performed as a reaction of expression to music. Dance requires a variety of complex motions that closely resemble each other in terms of body postures and hand gestures. It is essential to decompose and monitor the movements to improve the training quality in dance training. To reduce the intensity of professional work in dance and improve the level of dance art, this study proposes a dance recognition system based on the contour model. A Bluetooth-based system is used to collect dancers' movement information. Then, the discrete cosine transform is used to extract distinct features of the contour images and establish the energy map of the national dance posture. The postures in the dance video sequence are combined with the Baum-Welch algorithm to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) with the optimal parameters. The forward and backward algorithms of the HMM are used to obtain the probability of observing the sequence postures. The maximum probability model is considered the posture of national dance recognition. Results show that the model achieved better results with 93.1% accuracy. Through experimental verification, it is demonstrated that the method can effectively improve the level of dance art.

AB Under the background of a green, low carbon economy, it is significant to accurately estimate the future CO2 emissions of countries with significant CO2 emissions for developing the world's green economy. A new Nonlinear Grey Bernoulli and BP neural network combined model (BP-ONGBM (1,1) model) have been proposed to study the CO2 emissions of China, the USA, the European Union, India and Japan. Firstly, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is optimized using the Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA). Then, the background value of the ONGBM (1,1) model is dynamically optimized. Based on the linearization of the model, the time response function is derived. Then, the ONGBM (1,1) model is combined with the BP neural network model. An improved PSO algorithm determines the combined weight and the background value coefficient. Finally, according to the observation data from 2010 to 2021 in the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research 2022, the model is established to calculate the CO2 emissions of the selected countries from 2022 to 2026 and compared with the prediction results provided by multiple competitive models. The empirical application shows that the proposed BP-ONGBM (1,1) model is significantly better than other competitive models.

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; DECISION-MAKING;
   DOMINANCE
AB The function of most multi-objective algorithms (MOEAs) is to provide an overall trade-off Pareto front to the decision makers (DMs). But DMs actually tend to have a preference for a specific subset of the Pareto front. So combing decision makers' preference information with many-objective optimization methods has recently been a hot survey topic in the research field of many-objective optimization. The preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithms using goal vectors (PICEA-g) coevolve a family of decision makers' preferences called preference set together with a population of candidate solutions. It is a classic and effective algorithm, but it has shortcomings in distribution and there is a waste of computing resources. So we use a sparse autoencoder as a controller to perform feature processing on the target solution set in the process of coordinated evolution and modify the fitness assignment formula to improve the diversity. The combination of PICEA-g and sparse autoencoder framework enhance the convergence and expand the ability of the PICEA-g algorithm. The preference-inspired coevolutionary algorithm with sparse autoencoder (PICEA-g/SAE) is evaluated by three widely used benchmark suites and compared with nine classic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to prove the advantages of the sparse autoencoder framework. The experimental results show that PICEA-g/SAE could have a good performance on many DTLZ test problems. Moreover, PICEA-g/SAE on UF1-9 and WFG1-9 test problems in low dimensions could have good convergence, diversity, and spread compared with other algorithms.

AB Differential evolution (DE) algorithms tend to be limited to local optimization when solving complex optimization problems. Different iteration schemes lead to different convergence speeds. In this paper, we mainly use the dynamic mutation parameter FS to improve the DE algorithm. Based on two ideas, a total of seven DE schemes are proposed to optimize the DE algorithm. We test the performance of the improved DE scheme on 56 test functions. Experiments show that the improved DE algorithm is better than the baseline DE algorithm in terms of accuracy, convergence and8 convergence speed.

AB Differential evolution (DE) has been applied to solve various optimization problems due to its simplicity and high search efficiency. However, researchers have confirmed that it still has some shortcomings such as premature convergence and slow convergence, especially when dealing with complex optimization problems. To address these concerning issues, this paper proposes a hybrid particle swarm-differential evolution algorithm (HPSDE). Firstly, to enhance the optimization performance, a modified updating scheme named particle-swarm mutation strategy is designed and an improved control parameters adaption is developed. Then, DE/rand-to-rand/1 mutation strategy is adopted to increase the population diversity and enhance the ability of particles escaping away from local optima. To achieve an improved DE variant with rapid convergence and fine stability, a random mutation framework is designed to combine the two mutation strategies mentioned above. To evaluate the efficiency of HPSDE algorithm, four different experiments have been taken on twenty-nine benchmark functions. The numerical results validate that HPSDE has better overall performance than the other competitors. Additionally, HPSDE is successfully applied to solve five typical engineering optimization problems.

AB Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a challenging task, and the typical convolutional neural network (CNN) cannot well handle the speech data directly. Because CNN tends to understand local information and ignores the overall characteristics. This paper proposes a Capsule Network with Two-Way Attention MechanismTWACapsNet for short) for the SER problem. TWACapsNet accepts the spatial and spectral features as inputs, and the convolutional layer and the capsule layer are deployed to process these two types of features in two ways separately. After that, two attention mechanisms are designed to enhance the information obtained from the spatial and spectral features. Finally, the results of these two ways are combined to form the final decision. The advantage of TWACapsNet is verified by experiments on multiple SER data sets, and experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the widely-deployed neural network models on three typical SER data sets. Furthermore, the combination of the two ways contributes to the higher and more stable performance of TWACapsNet.

AB This work aims to implement an automated data-driven model for breast cancer detection in mammograms to support physicians' decision process within a breast cancer screening or detection program. The public available CBIS-DDSM and the INbreast datasets were used as sources to implement the transfer learning technique on full-field digital mammography proprietary dataset. The proprietary dataset reflects a real heterogeneous case study, consisting of 190 masses, 46 asymmetries, and 71 distortions. Several Yolo architectures were compared, including YoloV3, YoloV5, and YoloV5-Transformer. In addition, Eigen-CAM was implemented for model introspection and outputs explanation by highlighting all the suspicious regions of interest within the mammogram. The small YoloV5 model resulted in the best developed solution obtaining an mAP of 0.621 on proprietary dataset. The saliency maps computed via Eigen-CAM have proven capable solution reporting all regions of interest also on incorrect prediction scenarios. In particular, Eigen-CAM produces a substantial reduction in the incidence of false negatives, although accompanied by an increase in false positives. Despite the presence of hard-to-recognize anomalies such as asymmetries and distortions on the proprietary dataset, the trained model showed encouraging detection capabilities. The combination of Yolo predictions and the generated saliency maps represent two complementary outputs for the reduction of false negatives. Nevertheless, it is imperative to regard these outputs as qualitative tools that invariably necessitate clinical radiologic evaluation. In this view, the model represents a trusted predictive system to support cognitive and decision-making, encouraging its integration into real clinical practice.

AB The gate-based model is one of the leading quantum computing paradigms for representing quantum circuits. Within this paradigm, a quantum algorithm is expressed in terms of a set of quantum gates that are executed on the quantum hardware over time, subject to a number of constraints whose satisfaction must be guaranteed before running the circuit, to allow for feasible execution. The need to guarantee the previous feasibility condition gives rise to the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). The QCCP has been demonstrated to be NP-Complete, and can be considered as a Planning and Scheduling problem. In this paper, we consider quantum compilation instances deriving from the general Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), applied to the MaxCut problem, devised to be executed on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware architectures. More specifically, in addition to the basic QCCP version, we also tackle other variants of the same problem such as the QCCP-X (QCCP with crosstalk constraints), the QCCP-V (QCCP with variable qubit state initialization), as well as the QCCP-VX that includes both previous variants. All problem variants are solved using genetic algorithms. We perform an experimental study across a conventional set of instances taken from the literature, and show that the proposed genetic algorithm, termed GAVX, outperforms previous approaches in the literature.

   Auxiliary information; TV program recommendation
AB Recommendation systems for TV programs play an important role in alleviating the information overload problem. Existing TV program recommendation methods either do not aggregate neighborhood information well to capture collaborative signals from interaction data, or fail to make good use of auxiliary information, because they ignore the heterogeneity of different entities and relationships. In this paper, we propose a multi-component graph collaborative filtering recommendation based on auxiliary information, which learns representations of user and program through heterogeneous data modeling and information propagation on graphs. We extract homogeneous subgraphs from the heterogeneous graph based on multiple symmetric meta-paths, learn the components of the node representation by performing graph convolution on the homogeneous subgraphs, and finally combine the components to obtain the complete user representation and program representation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach can effectively improve the performance of TV program recommendations compared to the existing baselines.

AB Cassava is a significant source of carbohydrates for tropical populations. However, diseases caused by agents such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and phytoplasmas cause considerable economic damage to these crops. Existing methods for cassava disease detection require farmers to seek the assistance of agricultural experts for visual inspection and diagnosis, which is challenging and laborious. Most studies have employed pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect diseases in cassava leaves. Also, it is essential to design customized deep neural networks specific to the target domain for precise classification. This research proposes a novel deep fusion of two networks, residual channel shuffled attention network and Efficientnet. The first network, RCSANet, was presented to capture contextual information using depthwise separable convolution effectively. It also integrates significant inter-spatial and inter-channel information using the triplet attention module and employs shuffled group convolution to capture features from distinct filter groups. As a result of incorporating the above architectural enhancements, the proposed feature fusion network exhibited better performance than the existing studies. The proposed network was trained on the Kaggle cassava leaf disease dataset with 21,367 samples and yielded a classification accuracy of 93.25%.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB To address the challenge of partially observable environment states in multi-ship collision avoidance decision-making, a novel collision avoidance decision model is developed based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP), integrating both static and dynamic obstacles. A new reward mechanism is designed to overcome the problem of sparse rewards, incorporating the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs) into the reward function. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to train the model, accompanied by a suitable network structure. Furthermore, image conversion and scaling operations are applied to the network's architecture to reduce the dimensionality of the state space, thereby enhancing the training speed and fitting performance of the algorithm. Subsequently, a simulation environment is created using the Gym platform, incorporating multiple static and dynamic obstacles, and a series of experiments containing classic encounter scenarios are designed to validate the model. The evaluation metrics, such as the total cumulative reward and training steps, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of making accurate decisions in an environment with combined static and dynamic obstacles. Through several ablation experiments and analysis of total run-time, it is shown that the proposed reward mechanism effectively addresses the issue of sparse rewards, while the algorithm significantly improves the fitting speed and expedites the training process. The proposed algorithm's ability to address the problem of partially observable environment states in multi-ship collision avoidance decision-making is confirmed through a comparison with other classical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms.

AB Multimaterial 3D printing is an attractive route for low-cost fabrication of electronic systems having different types of embedded devices. Herein, tunable thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)-based conductive composite filaments are presented for development of either strain sensors or different circuit elements. The filaments are developed with two filler materials, namely, silver and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). The influences of filler aspect ratio (AR), concentration, functionalization, and morphology on the composites' mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties are studied. Printed tracks of the 10 wt% high-AR MWCNT/TPU filament exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 0.92 S cm(-1) and withstand powers >1 W and currents >100 mA. The filament shows negligible change in impedance over the frequency range 1 kHz-1 MHz and a change in the resistance of <5% with 90 & DEG; bending. Conversely, printed tracks using filaments with 3 wt% low-AR MWCNT exhibit a change in resistance of & AP;30% with 90 & DEG; bending, allowing a clear distinction between various bending angles, and thus could be used for embedded strain/bend sensors. These results suggest that, with the correct optimization, multimaterial additive manufacturing can be utilized with tunable conductive filaments to fabricate complex 3D electronic systems by constructing reliable circuit tracks, bendable interconnects, and sensors.

AB Improving existing products plays a vital role in enhancing customer satisfaction and coping with changes in the market. Analyzing user experience (UX) to find the deficiencies of existing products and establishing improved schemes is the key to UX-driven product improvement, especially at the conceptual design stage. Although some tools used in conceptual design, such as requirements analysis and knowledge reasoning, have advanced recently, they lack targeted goals and sufficient efficiency in identifying insufficient product attributes and improving existing functions and structures. The challenge lies in considering the influence imposed on design activities by the original product features (including attributes, functions, and structure). In this study, a knowledge-enabled approach and framework that integrates the conceptual design process, online reviews for UX, and knowledge is proposed to support product improvement. Specifically, a decision-making algorithm based on UX analysis is proposed to identify to-be-improved product attributes. Then, through optimizing the previous knowledge application model from knowledge requirement transformation, knowledge modeling, and knowledge reasoning, a smart knowledge reasoning model is established to push knowledge for functional solving of the to-be-improved attributes. A knowledge configuration method is used to modify product features to generate an improved scheme. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, a case study of improving an agricultural sprayer is conducted. Through discussion, this study can help to regulate design activities for product improvement, enhance data and knowledge application, and promote divergent thinking during scheme modification.

AB Temporal action detection is usually divided into two stages: temporal action proposal generation and proposal classification. Most methods consider the proposal classification stage as an action recognition task. However, compared with trimmed videos, proposals generally contain part of the ground-truth action, lacking enough semantic information to predict their categories precisely. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal-visual proposal graph (TVPG) module to acquire sufficient semantic information for action proposal classification. The module first adopts a proposal graph construction strategy to select valuable neighbor proposals for each proposal and constructs them into an action proposal graph. Then, it applies a temporal graph convolution network and a visual graph convolution network in parallel on the graph to improve proposal feature quality by obtaining action information from neighbors. In the temporal graph convolution network, we design a novel temporal graph convolution operation that embeds temporal position relation information into proposal features and extracts the information from other proposals by temporal position relations. Based on the TVPG module, we construct an action proposal classification model named the temporal-visual proposal graph network (TVPGN) and perform extensive experiments on two benchmarks. The results show that TVPGN achieves competitive performance on both datasets.

ID FRAMEWORK; CNN; CONVOLUTION; ALGORITHM
AB Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have attracted considerable interest in image denoising because of their excellent learning capacity. However, most of the existing methods cannot fully extract and utilize the fine features during denoising, resulting in insufficient detailed information extracted and limited model expression ability, especially in complex denoising tasks. Inspired by the above challenges, in this paper, a feature-enhanced multi-scale residual network (FEMRNet) is proposed, mainly including an enhanced feature extraction block (EFEB), a multi-scale residual backbone (MSRB), a detail information recovery block (DIRB) and a merge reconstruction block (MRB). Specifically, the EFEB can increase the receptive field through dilated convolution with different expansion factors, and multi-scale convolution can further enhance the feature. The MSRB integrates global and local feature information through residual denoising blocks and skip connections to enhance the inferencing ability of denoising models. The DIRB is used to finely extract the information in the image, and combine the timing information by convGRU to restore the image details. Finally, MRB is designed to construct a clean image by subtracting the fused noise mapping obtained from MSRB and DIRB with a given noisy image. Additionally, extensive experiments are implemented on commonly-used denoising benchmarks. Comparison experiments with state-of-the-art methods and ablation experiments show that our method achieves promising performance in denoising tasks.

DE Representation learning; Intermediate distribution; Classification;

AB Simple neural network classification tasks are based on performing extraction as transformations of the set simultaneously with optimization of weights on individual layers. In this paper, the Representation 7 architecture is proposed, the primary assumption of which is to divide the inductive procedure into separate blocks - transformation and decision - which may lead to a better generalization ability of the presented model. Architecture is based on the processing context of the typical neural network and unifies datasets into a shared, generically sampled space. It can be applicable in the case of difficult problems - defined not as imbalance or streaming data but by low-class separability and a high dimensionality. This article has tested the hypothesis that - in such conditions - the proposed method could achieve better results than reference algorithms by comparing the R7 architecture with state-of-the-art methods, raw mlp and Tabnet architecture. The contributions of this work are the proposition of the new architecture and complete experiments on synthetic and real datasets with the evaluation of the quality and loss achieved by R7 and by reference methods.

AB With the rapid growth in cellular user quantity and quality of service demand, the resource allocation in device-to-device communication system significantly affects the overall efficiency and user experience. In this study, the resource allocation for large-scale device-to-device communication system is modelled as a constrained optimization problem with thousands of dimensionalities. Then, the variable-coupling relationship of the developed model is analysed and the mathematical proof is firstly provided, and a novel algorithm namely multi-modal mutation cooperatively coevolving particle swarm optimization is developed to optimize the ultra-high dimensional model. Finally, efficacy of the developed method is verified by a comprehensive set of case studies, some famous algorithms for the specialized literature are also employed for comparison. Experimental results shown that the developed algorithm can obtain accurate and robust optimization performance for different system scales. In addition, when the system scale increases to 1000 cellular users and 300 D2D-pair users, the developed method can still outperform the compared algorithms and output accurate resource allocation solution.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Federated learning; Composition and decomposition; Clustering
AB Federated learning has been shown to be efficient for training a global model without needing to collect all data from multiple entities to the centralized server. However, the model performance, communication traffic, and data privacy and security are still the focus of federated learning after it has been developed. In this paper, a composition-decomposition based federated learning, denoted as CD-FL, is proposed. In the CD-FL approach, the global model, composed of K sub-models with the same framework, will be decomposed and broadcast to all clients. Each client will randomly choose a sub-model, update its parameters using its own dataset, and upload this sub-model to the server. All sub-models, including the sub-models before and after updating, will be clustered into K clusters to form the global model of the next round. Experimental results on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, EMNIST, and Tiny-IMAGENET datasets show the efficiency of the model performance and communication traffic of the proposed method.

AB To express the opinions of decision-makers, q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy sets (q-ROHFSs) have been employed extensively. Therefore, it is necessary to construct q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy preference relations (q-ROHFPRs) as a crucial decision-making tool for decision-makers. The goal of this paper aims to define a new consistency and consensus approach for solving q-ROHFPR group decision-making (GDM) problems. To do this, we first state the definitions of q-ROHFPRs and additive consistent q-ROHFPRs based on q-ROHFSs, an additive consistency index and acceptable additive consistent q-ROHFPRs. Second, based on minimizing the deviation, we establish an acceptable goal programming model for unacceptable additive consistent q-ROHFPRs. Third, an iterative algorithm is created for achieving acceptable consistency and reaching a rational consensus. The degree of rational consensus among individual q-ROHFPRs is quantified by a distance-based consensus index. Afterward, a non-linear programming model is formulated to derive the priority vector of alternatives, which are q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy numbers (q-ROHFNs). Based on this model, a GDM model for q-ROHFPRs is then developed. To demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed GDM model, a case study on the risk assessment of hypertension is provided. The finding of sensitivity and comparison analyses supports the feasibility and efficacy of the suggested approach.

AB Natural languages vary in their quantity expressions, but the variation seems to be constrained by general properties, so-called universals. Their explanations have been sought among constraints of human cognition, communication, complexity, and pragmatics. In this article, we apply a state-of-the-art language coordination model to the semantic domain of quantities to examine whether two quantity universals-monotonicity and convexity-arise as a result of coordination. Assuming precise number perception by the agents, we evolve communicatively usable quantity terminologies in two separate conditions: a numeric-based condition in which agents communicate about a number of objects and a quotient-based condition in which agents communicate about the proportions. We find out that both universals take off in all conditions but only convexity almost entirely dominates the emergent languages. Additionally, we examine whether the perceptual constraints of the agents can contribute to the further development of universals. We compare the degrees of convexity and monotonicity of languages evolving in populations of agents with precise and approximate number sense. The results suggest that approximate number sense significantly reinforces monotonicity and leads to further enhancement of convexity. Last but not least, we show that the properties of the evolved quantifiers match certain invariance properties from generalized quantifier theory.

DT Article
ID IDENTIFICATION; METABOLOMICS; DATABASE; HMDB
AB Tandem mass spectroscopy is a useful tool to identify metabolites but is limited by the capability of computational methods to annotate peaks with chemical structures when spectra are dissimilar to previously observed spectra. Goldman and colleagues use a transformer-based method to annotate chemical structure fragments, thereby incorporating domain insights into its architecture, and to simultaneously predict the structure of the metabolite and its fragments from the spectrum.
   Metabolomics studies have identified small molecules that mediate cell signaling, competition and disease pathology, in part due to large-scale community efforts to measure tandem mass spectra for thousands of metabolite standards. Nevertheless, the majority of spectra observed in clinical samples cannot be unambiguously matched to known structures. Deep learning approaches to small-molecule structure elucidation have surprisingly failed to rival classical statistical methods, which we hypothesize is due to the lack of in-domain knowledge incorporated into current neural network architectures. Here we introduce a neural network-driven workflow for untargeted metabolomics, Metabolite Inference with Spectrum Transformers (MIST), to annotate tandem mass spectra peaks with chemical structures. Unlike existing approaches, MIST incorporates domain insights into its architecture by encoding peaks with their chemical formula representations, implicitly featurizing pairwise neutral losses and training the network to additionally predict substructure fragments. MIST performs favorably compared with both standard neural architectures and the state-of-the-art kernel method on the task of fingerprint prediction for over 70% of metabolite standards and retrieves 66% of metabolites with equal or improved accuracy, with 29% strictly better. We further demonstrate the utility of MIST by suggesting potential dipeptide and alkaloid structures for differentially abundant spectra found in an inflammatory bowel disease patient cohort.

AB In this research, a kind of BAM neural networks containing three nonidentical time delays are explored. Exploiting fixed point knowledge, we examine that the solution to the concerned BAM neural network models exists and is unique. Exploiting a apposite function, we check that the solution to the concerned BAM neural network models is bounded. In line with different delay cases, we systematically analyze the characteristic equations of the concerned BAM neural network models. A set of innovative bifurcation criteria of the concerned BAM neural network models under the six delay situations are acquired. The impact of delay is adequately revealed under different delay cases. The research indicates that delay plays a pivotal role in dominating stability domain and the time that Hopf bifurcation arises. of the concerned BAM neural networks. In order to sustain the theoretical assertions, we present the corresponding software simulation plots. The acquired conclusion of this research are completely novel and has momentous theoretical values in dominating and devising networks.

AB Studies on graph contrastive learning, which is an effective way of self-supervision, have achieved excellent experimental performance. Most existing methods generate two augmented views, and then perform feature learning on the two views through maximizing semantic consistency. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to generate optimal views to facilitate the graph construction that can reveal the essential association relations among nodes by graph contrastive learning. Considering that the extremely high mutual information between views is prone to have a negative effect on model training, a good choice is to add constraints to the graph data augmentation process. This paper proposes two constraint principles, low dissimilarity priority (LDP) and mutual exclusion (ME), to mitigate the mutual information between views and compress redundant parts of mutual information between views. LDP principle aims to reduce the mutual information between views at global scale, and ME principle works to reduce the mutual information at local scale. They are opposite and appropriate in different situations. Without loss of generality, the two proposed principles are applied to two well-performed graph contrastive methods, i.e. GraphCL and GCA, and experimental results on 20 public benchmark datasets show that the models with the aid of the two proposed constraint principles achieve higher recognition accuracy.

DE Deep learning; Point clouds; Self-augment; Classification; Segmentation
AB Point cloud classification and segmentation are challenging tasks due to the irregular structures, especially when there is translation variance in the point clouds. To overcome this barrier, this paper proposes a self-augment convolutional neural network (SACNN), which can not only extract more discriminative features from the points cloud but also alleviate the translation variance problem. Specifically, we first represent the point cloud through the dynamic graph, with the intention to keep the number of point clouds during the feature learning to avoid information loss. Benefiting from the dynamic graph, the global and local features of point clouds can be learned. Then, to reduce the translation variance in the dynamic graphs, a self-augment convolution (SAConv) module is designed to make points align their coordinates based on learned features. Finally, the local mixed aggregation module is proposed to combine the overview and the detailed descriptor of the neighbors. Experiments on several standard benchmarks verify the superiority of the SACNN over state-of-the-art methods in both 3D point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

TI CEHMR: Curriculum learning enhanced hierarchical multi-label

DE Medication recommendation; EHR; Hierarchical multi-label classification;
   Curriculum learning
AB The medication recommendation (MR) or medication combination prediction task aims to predict effective prescriptions given accurate patient representations derived from electronic health records (EHRs), which contributes to improving the quality of clinical decision-making, especially for patients with multi-morbidity. Although in recent years deep learning technology has achieved great success in MR, the performance of current multi-label based MR solutions is unsatisfactory. They mainly focus on improving the patient representation module and modeling the medication label dependencies such as drug-drug interaction (DDI) correlation and co-occurrence relationship. However, the hierarchical dependency among medication labels and diversity of difficulty among MR training examples lack sufficient consideration. In this paper, we propose a framework of Curriculum learning Enhanced Hierarchical multi-label classification for MR (CEHMR). Motivated by the category hierarchy of medications which organizes standard medication codes in a hierarchical structure, we utilize it to provide more trustworthy prior knowledge for modeling label dependency. Specifically, we design a hierarchical multi-label classifier with a learnable gate fusion layer, to simultaneously capture the level-independent (local) and level-dependent (global) hierarchical information in the medication hierarchy. In addition, to overcome the diversity of training example difficulties, and progressively achieve a smoother training process, we introduce a bootstrap-based curriculum learning strategy. Hence, the example difficulty can be measured based on the predictive performance of the MR model, and then all training examples would be retrained from easy to hard under the guidance of a predefined training scheduler. Experiments on the real-world medical MIMIC-III database demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-theart performance compared with seven representative baselines, and extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component of CEHMR.

AB This paper presents the Transplantation, Adaptation and Creation (TAC) framework, a method for assessing the localization of different elements of an AI system. This framework is applied in the public health context, notably to different types of models that were used during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework aims to guide AI for public health developers and public health officials in conceptualizing model localization. The paper provides guidance justifying the importance of model localization, within a broader context of policy models, geopolitics and decolonization. It also suggests procedures for moving between the different elements in the framework, for example going from transplantation to adapation, and from adaptation to creation. This paper is submitted as part of a special research topic entitled: A digitally-enabled, science-based global pandemic preparedness and response scheme: how ready are we for the next pandemic?

DT Article
ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In this paper, a discretization-free approach based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN) is proposed for solving the forward and inverse problems governed by the nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) systems. By embedding physical information described by the CDR system in the feedforward neural networks, PINN is trained to approximate the solution of the system without the need of labeled data. The good performance of PINN in solving the forward problem of the nonlinear CDR systems is verified by studying the problems of gas-solid adsorption and autocatalytic reacting flow. For CDR systems with different Peclet number, PINN can largely eliminate the numerical diffusion and unphysical oscillations in traditional numerical methods caused by high Peclet number. Meanwhile, the PINN framework is implemented to solve the inverse problem of nonlinear CDR systems and the results show that the unknown parameters can be effectively recognized even with high noisy data. It is concluded that the established PINN algorithm has good accuracy, convergence, and robustness for both the forward and inverse problems of CDR systems.

AB This article describes a novel sufficient condition concerning approximations with reservoir computing (RC). Recently, RC using a physical system as the reservoir has attracted attention. Because many physical systems are modeled as state-space systems, it is necessary to guarantee the approximations given by reservoirs represented as nonlinear state-space systems. There are two problems with existing approaches: a reservoir must have a property called fading memory and must be represented as a set of maps between input and output signals on the bi-infinite-time (BIT) interval. These two conditions are too strict for reservoirs represented as nonlinear state-space systems as they require the reservoir to have a unique equilibrium state for the zero input. This article proposes an approach that employs operators from right-infinite-time (RIT) inputs to RIT outputs. Furthermore, we develop a novel extension of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem to handle discontinuous functions. To apply the extended theorem, we define functionals corresponding to operators and introduce a metric on the domain of the functionals. The resulting sufficient condition does not require the reservoir to have fading memory or continuity with respect to inputs and time. Therefore, our result guarantees the approximations with very common reservoirs and provides a rationale for physical RC. We present an example of a physical reservoir without fading memory. With the example reservoir, the RC model successfully approximates NARMA10, a benchmark task for time series predictions.

The analysis focuses on the model's consistency in variable selection, prediction accuracy, stability, and efficiency. This study employs a novel approach to assess the consistency of variable selection across models. Specifically, the angle between the actual coefficient vector & beta; and the estimated coefficient vector & beta;<SIC> is computed to determine the degree of consistency. Additionally, the boxplot tool of statistical analysis is utilized to visually represent the distribution of model prediction accuracy data and variable selection consistency. The comparative stability of each model is assessed based on the frequency of outliers. This study conducts comparative experiments of numerical simulation to evaluate a proposed model evaluation method against commonly used analysis methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method, highlighting its ability to conveniently analyze the stability and efficiency of each fitting model.

AB A knowledge graph is convenient for storing knowledge in artificial intelligence applications. On the other hand, it has some shortcomings that need to be improved. These shortcomings can be summarised as the inability to automatically update all the knowledge affecting a piece of knowledge when it changes, ambiguity, inability to sort the knowledge, inability to keep some knowledge immutable, and inability to make a quick comparison between knowledge. In our work, reliability, consistency, immutability, and context mechanisms are integrated into the knowledge graph to solve these deficiencies and improve the knowledge graph's performance. Hash technology is used in the design of these mechanisms. In addition, the mechanisms we have developed are kept separate from the knowledge graph to ensure that the functionality of the knowledge graph is not impaired. The mechanisms we developed within the scope of the study were tested by comparing them with the traditional knowledge graph. It was shown graphically and with t-test methods that our proposed structures have higher performance in terms of update and comparison. It is expected that the mechanisms we have developed will contribute to improving the performance of artificial intelligence software using knowledge graphs.

Our objective was to answer the following research question: how and to what extent does the AI/ML/robot literature we covered include well-being in relation to disabled people? We found 2071 academic abstracts covering AI/ML and well-being, and 1055 covering robotics and well-being. Within these abstracts, only 39 covered AI/ML and 48 robotics and well-being in relation to disabled people. The tone of the coverage was techno-positive and techno-optimistic arguing that AI/ML/robotics could improve the well-being of disabled people in general or improve well-being by helping disabled people overcome their 'disability' or make tasks easier. No negative effects that AI/ML/robotics could have or has had on the well-being of disabled people were mentioned. Disabled people were portrayed only within patient, client, or user roles but not in their roles as stakeholders in the governance of AI/ML/robotics discussions. This biased and limited coverage of the impact of AI/ML/robotics on the well-being of disabled people disempowers disabled people.

   randomized neural network; self-distillation
AB Knowledge distillation (KD) is a conventional method in the field of deep learning that enables the transfer of dark knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, consequently improving the performance of the student model. In randomized neural networks, due to the simple topology of network architecture and the insignificant relationship between model performance and model size, KD is not able to improve model performance. In this work, we propose a self-distillation pipeline for randomized neural networks: the predictions of the network itself are regarded as the additional target, which are mixed with the weighted original target as a distillation target containing dark knowledge to supervise the training of the model. All the predictions during multi-generation self-distillation process can be integrated by a multi-teacher method. By induction, we have additionally arrived at the methods for infinite self-distillation (ISD) of randomized neural networks. We then provide relevant theoretical analysis about the self-distillation method for randomized neural networks. Furthermore, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications on several benchmark datasets.

AB Information in sign language (SL) is transmitted in large part by the movement, positioning, and shape of the hands as well as body language and facial emotions. Systems that recognize sign language can help with the problem that sign language is not widely used despite the large number of individuals who need to use it, and they can give hearing-impaired and deaf people a more practical way of life, employment, and education. Despite the fact that facial features are treated to be fundamental for humans to comprehend sign language, few earlier research work have inspected their cognitive importance for automatic SL recognition systems. To address this problem, this paper comes up with a novel manual and non-manual gesture recognition framework (MNM-VGG16) for the deaf and mute people. The framework employs a convolutional neural network, renowned as VGG-16 net, for implementing a trained model on an amply used video dataset by employing a component that learns the Multimodal Spatial Representation (MSR) of various modalities. The Multimodal Temporal Representation (MTR) component shapes temporal corrections from independent and dependent pathways to analyze the cooperation of different modalities. A cooperative optimization scheme, summarized by the employment of multi-scale perception component, is applied to make the finest of various modalities sources for sign language recognition. To validate the efficiency of MNM-VGG16, we carried out experiments on three large-scale sign language benchmarks: CSL Split II, SIGNUM, and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014. Experimental results prove that the suggested framework reaches new state-of-the-art achievement on all three benchmarks, and this attainment is noted by the reduction of the word error rate (WER) on test set by 14.2%, 13.7%, and 11.2%, respectively. In this paper, we offer the MNM-VGG16 hybrid method, which recognizes SL words by combining manual and non-manual features. This method demonstrates the significance of jointly modeling various body parts for SL recognition.

LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Index Terms-Deep neural networks (DNNs); generalization; information
   theory; learning theory
AB Deep learning has transformed computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. However, two critical questions remain obscure: 1) why do deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize better than shallow networks and 2) does it always hold that a deeper network leads to better performance? In this article, we first show that the expected generalization error of neural networks (NNs) can be upper bounded by the mutual information between the learned features in the last hidden layer and the parameters of the output layer. This bound further implies that as the number of layers increases in the network, the expected generalization error will decrease under mild conditions. Layers with strict information loss, such as the convolutional or pooling layers, reduce the generalization error for the whole network; this answers the first question. However, algorithms with zero expected generalization error do not imply a small test error. This is because the expected training error is large when the information for fitting the data is lost as the number of layers increases. This suggests that the claim "the deeper the better" is conditioned on a small training error. Finally, we show that deep learning satisfies a weak notion of stability and provides some generalization error bounds for noisy stochastic gradient decent (SGD) and binary classification in DNNs.

AB Popularity bias, as a long-standing problem in recommender systems (RSs), has been fully considered and explored for offline recommendation systems in most existing relevant researches, but very few studies have paid attention to eliminate such bias in online interactive recommendation scenarios. Bias amplification will become increasingly serious over time due to the existence of feedback loop between the user and the interactive system. However, existing methods have only investigated the causal relations among different factors statically without considering temporal dependencies inherent in the online interactive recommendation system, making them difficult to be adapted to online settings. To address these problems, we propose a novel counterfactual interactive policy learning (CIPL) method to eliminate popularity bias for online recommendation. It first scrutinizes the causal relations in the interactive recommender models and formulates a novel temporal causal graph (TCG) to guide the training and counterfactual inference of the causal interactive recommendation system. Concretely, TCG is used to estimate the causal relations of item popularity on prediction score when the user interacts with the system at each time during model training. Besides, it is also used to remove the negative effect of popularity bias in the test stage. To train the causal interactive recommendation system, we formulated our CIPL by the actor-critic framework with an online interactive environment simulator. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve the new state-of-the-art performance.

AB Pre-trained language models are now ubiquitous in natural language processing, being successfully applied for many different tasks and in several real-world applications. However, even though there is a wealth of high-quality written materials on surgery, and the scientific community has shown a growing interest in the application of natural language processing techniques in surgery, a pre-trained language model specific to the surgical domain is still missing. The creation and public release of such a model would serve numerous useful clinical applications. For example, it could enhance existing surgical knowledge bases employed for task automation, or assist medical students in summarizing complex surgical descriptions. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce SurgicBERTa, a pre-trained language model specific for the English surgical language, i.e., the language used in the surgical domain. SurgicBERTa has been obtained from RoBERTa through continued pre-training with the Masked language modeling objective on 300 k sentences taken from English surgical books and papers, for a total of 7 million words. By publicly releasing SurgicBERTa, we make available a resource built from the content collected in many high-quality surgical books, online textual resources, and academic papers. We performed several assessments in order to evaluate SurgicBERTa, comparing it with the general domain RoBERTa. First, we intrinsically assessed the model in terms of perplexity, accuracy, and evaluation loss resulting from the continual training according to the masked language modeling task. Then, we extrinsically evaluated SurgicBERTa on several downstream tasks, namely (i) procedural sentence detection, (ii) procedural knowledge extraction, (iii) ontological information discovery, and (iv) surgical terminology acquisition. Finally, we conducted some qualitative analysis on SurgicBERTa, showing that it contains a lot of surgical knowledge that could be useful to enrich existing state-of-the-art surgical knowledge bases or to extract surgical knowledge. All the assessments show that SurgicBERTa better deals with surgical language than a general-purpose pre-trained language model such as RoBERTa, and therefore can be effectively exploited in many computer-assisted applications in the surgical domain.

DE Hate speech; Tweet text classification; User information and behavior
AB Social media provide users with a powerful platform to share their ideas. Using one's right to expression to incite hate toward a particular group of people is inappropriate. However, hate speech is pervasive in our society. Spreading hate through online social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok, and Instagram is commonplace in today's milieu. One such case is the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, which engendered anti-Asian hate. In the current literature, there is limited study on using user features in conjunction with textual features to detect hate speech. In this paper, we propose to combine tweet textual features with a variety of user features to improve the state-of-the-art hate speech detection techniques. The user feature we propose consists of demographic, behavioral-based, network-based, emotions, personality, readability, and writing style. To test our approach, we used four different English datasets gathered from Twitter and available in the public domain. Our results show that combining tweet textual features with the proposed user features improves hate speech detection up to +0.32 in F1 score and beats previously proposed approaches that use a limited number of user features. The analysis of the most important features confirms that hateful tweets or their authors express more negative emotions and use more swear words.

AB Morphological hierarchies constitute a rich and powerful family of graph-based structures that can be used for image modeling, processing and analysis. In this article, we focus on an important subfamily of morphological hierarchies, namely the trees that model partial partitions of the image support. This subfamily includes in particular the component-tree and the tree of shapes. In this context, we provide some new graph-based structures (one directed acyclic graph and three trees): the graph of valued shapes, the tree of valued shapes, the complete tree of shapes and the topological tree of shapes. These new objects create a continuum between the two notions of component-tree and tree of shapes. In particular, they allow to establish that these two trees (together with a third notion of adjacency tree generally considered in topological image analysis) can be defined and handled in a unified framework. In addition, this framework enables to enrich the component-tree with additional information, leading on the one hand to a topological description of grey-level images that relies on the same paradigm as persistent homology, and on the other hand to the proposal of a topological version of tree of shapes. This article provides a theoretical analysis of these new morphological hierarchies and their links with the usual ones. It also proposes an algorithmic description of two ways of building these new morphological hierarchies, and a discussion on the links that exist between these morphological hierarchies and certain topological invariants and descriptors.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB On the verge of superpixel methods exploiting saliency information, the Superpixels through Iterative CLEarcutting (SICLE) framework has reported fast and accurate superpixel delineation. It is composed of three steps: (i) seed oversampling; (ii) superpixel generation; and (iii) seed removal. It starts from (i) and applies several iterations of (ii) and (iii) until reaching the desired superpixel quantity. In this work, we improve SICLE such that it can now generate compact superpixels with accurate delineation. We exploit differential computation and propose several novel functions for steps (ii) and (iii) for proper saliency incorporation, compact superpixel generation, and improvement in speed and delineation. Results show that, with our proposals, SICLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in delineation and speed whenever saliency is absent with on-par compacity. When an accurate saliency map is provided, its performance improves significantly and requires only two iterations for segmentation.

AB It is crucial to accurately detect dead embryos when developing vaccines. Detection of photoplethysmography signals can help determine hatching egg activity via convolutional neural networks, which is considered the most reliable and promising method in the industry. The existing detection methods face some challenges because the convolution operations have difficulty capturing global representations from PPG signals. In this study, we propose a composite network structure, termed MifaNet, to take advantage of self-attention mechanisms for enhanced convolution operations. MifaNet captures long-distance feature dependencies and local feature details through independent branches. A feature fusion module is used to fuse concurrent features and output the detection results. Extensive experiments were conducted on our dataset, and the results confirm that MifaNet outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Short-term electricity load forecasting plays a crucial role in modern container terminal. In this work, we design a short-term forecasting approach aimed at port load under the framework of patch learning. Firstly, singular spectrum analysis is applied to obtain denoised and noise features, respectively; then, a patch learning model based on the long short-term memory network is employed to address such a time-series forecasting problem. LSTM network and BiLSTM are considered as the global models to process denoised and noisy data, respectively, and convolutional neural network is selected as the patch model. Furthermore, an endpoint detection strategy is designed for adaptively identifying the positions of patches. The performance of the proposed model is tested and verified on a real Chinese container terminal load dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, compared with state-of-the-art load forecasting models, has the greatest performance with respect to seven evaluation criteria.

DE Whale optimization algorithm; Circle and tent maps; Constrained
   optimization problems; Convergence factor
AB One of the most competitive nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms is the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). This algorithm is proven awesome in solving complex and constrained multi-objective problems. It is also popularly used as a feature selection algorithm while solving non-deterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard) problems. Many enhancements have been introduced in the literature for the WOA resulting in better optimization algorithms. Differently from these research efforts, this paper presents a novel version of the WOA called ANWOA. ANWOA considers producing two types of discrete chaotic maps that have suitable period states, and the highest sensitivity to initial conditions, randomness, and stability which in turn leads to optimal initial population selection and thus global optimality. The presented ANWOA uses two nonlinear parameters instead of the two linear ones which permeate both the exploration and exploitation phases of WOA, leading to accelerated convergence, better accuracy, and influential improvement in the spiral updating position. Additionally, a dynamic inertia weight coefficient is utilized to attain a suitable balance between the exploration and exploitation phases meanwhile improving the convergence speed. Furthermore, ANWOA uses circle map values that influence each random factor in the WOA and consequently ensuring not trapped in local optima with a promoted global optimum search. The empirical analysis is conducted in thirty-three benchmark functions, and the results show that the introduced novel algorithm is the most competitive one.

DE Melody extraction; Main melody; MIDI; Multiple melodies

AB As an essential part of music, main melody is the cornerstone of music information retrieval. In the MIR's sub-field of main melody extraction, the mainstream methods assume that the main melody is unique. However, the assumption cannot be established, especially for music with multiple main melodies such as symphony or music with many harmonies. Hence, the conventional methods ignore some main melodies in the music. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning-based Multiple Main Melodies Generator (Multi-MMLG) framework that can automatically predict potential main melodies from a MIDI file. This framework consists of two stages: (1) main melody classification using a proposed MIDIXLNet model and (2) conditional prediction using a modified MuseBERT model. Experiment results suggest that the proposed MIDIXLNet model increases the accuracy of main melody classification from 89.62 to 97.37%. In addition, this model requires fewer parameters (71.8 million) than the previous state-of-art approaches. We also conduct ablation experiments on the Multi-MMLG framework. In the best-case scenario, predicting meaningful multiple main melodies for the music are achieved.

AB Activation functions are crucial parts of artificial neural networks. From the first perceptron created artificially up to today, many functions are proposed. Some of them are currently in common use, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) and other ReLU variants. In this article we propose a novel activation function, called ExtendeD Exponential Linear Unit (DELU). After its introduction and presenting its basic properties, by making various simulations with different datasets and architectures, we show that it may perform better than other activation functions in certain cases. While also inheriting most of the good properties of ReLU and ELU, DELU offers an increase of success in comparison with them by slowing the alignment of neurons in early stages of training process. In experiments, DELU performed better than other activation functions in general, for Fashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks with different sized Residual Neural Networks (ResNet). Specifically, DELU managed to reduce the error rate by sufficiently high confidence levels in CIFAR datasets in comparison with ReLU and ELU networks. In addition, DELU is compared in an image segmentation example as well. Also, compatibility of DELU is tested with different initializations, and statistical methods are employed to verify these success rates by using Z-score analysis, which may be considered as a different view of success assessment in neural networks.

AB Recently, the discipline of Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) has attracted attention to exploiting Electroencephalograph (EEG) mental activities such as Motor Imagery (MI). Neurons in the human brain are activated during these MI tasks and generate an electrical potential of small magnitude reached to the scalp as a signal. Classification of MI data is a primary problem in BCI systems. Classification accuracy of these biomedical signals emerges as a significant task in the scientific community. This work proposes two main ideas: a new preprocessing technique based on four EEG frequency bands and a new stacking method for three deep-learning architectures used to decode three classes of MI signals. The preprocessing stage was introduced using Fast Fourier Transform to perform frequency analysis and data aggregation functions to enhance the data view. Performance was evaluated using well-defined metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score for multiple batch sizes, optimizers, and epochs. Experimental results were evaluated using a publicly available dataset (BCI Competition IV dataset 2a) and local data collected from four subjects using the EMOTIV EPOC headset. The highest f1-scores achieved with the R-CNN model were 94% and 84% using the aforementioned datasets. Our proposed models also outperform many related models studied in the literature.

We give the concepts of soft maximum, soft minimum, soft maximal, soft minimal, soft infimum and soft supremum in any s-poset. Then, the concept of soft order preserving mapping is defined and given some basic results. Moreover, it has been shown that the topology derived from a soft partial order relation is a soft topology which will substitute as a soft version of Alexandroff topology in classical theory. With all that, we obtained the category SPOSET of s-posets, and constructed a functor which is called ostracizer functor between the categories SPOSET and POSET.

AB The fast advancement of science and technology has transformed product designing by allowing designers to produce high-quality goods that fulfill the needs of customers and industries. With its realistic visual effects and immersive experience, virtual reality (VR) offers a new method of product designing by replacing expensive and inflexible physical prototypes. This research paper discusses an evaluation system for virtual product designing using VR-assisted approach to overcome these issues. The proposed approach aims to offer a quick and low-cost method for reviewing and analyzing product ideas. It uses a product display system for professionals to evaluate the designs and allows the experts to assess the product programs using evaluation indexes. The analysis procedure is based on evaluations of user experiences, which are divided into three categories: behavior layer experience, sensor layer experience, and reflection layer experience. The evaluation index structure is built using a hierarchical inference approach. The experimental findings performed in the study demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and system over existing algorithms and systems. The proposed algorithm regularly obtains higher prediction values by demonstrating improved predictive accuracy for athletic performance. Furthermore, the proposed system has increased variety, significant variances, and statistical significance when evaluating product design, resulting in higher customer satisfaction. These findings illustrate potential of the suggested approach to improve product design and overall consumer pleasure by providing significant insights for the engineering and industrial sectors.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed not only in businesses, entertainment, and academia but also in sports training to raise the level of competition among athletes. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are the brains of modern AI, and this paper examines their application in sports training's load prediction with the hope of improving athletic performance, creating scientifically efficient training programs, and increasing the accuracy of training load forecasts. First, a sports training analysis system based on Browser Server (B/S) is constructed, and the overall structure, specific function modules, and database of the system are designed and introduced. Then, the artificial fish swarm algorithm (AFSA)-based prediction and modeling approach of sports training's load is applied. To put it more specifically, we obtained a comprehensive index of joint acceleration in sports training by using data acquisition devices such as sensors. The independent variable in the load prediction is defined by the computational results, which are combined with other relevant features to obtain the load characteristics of sports training. The initial weights and thresholds of the ANN are optimized with the help of AFSA. To produce the final prediction result, the optimized ANN and extracted load characteristics are coupled with the prediction equation. The prediction model is applied to the sports training analysis system for realizing the application of training load prediction. Experiments show that the methods proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy and efficiency of sports training and load prediction, improve the effect of athletes' training, and thus enhances the level of sports competitiveness.

AB In order to solve the problems of insufficient optimization accuracy, slow convergence speed and easy to fall into local optimum in the whale optimization algorithm, this paper proposes a whale optimization algorithm with improved neighborhood search strategy. First, the algorithm generates a more evenly distributed and higher-quality initial population through an initialization strategy based on the opposite-based learning of pinhole imaging to expand the early search space of the algorithm. Secondly, it adopts improved neighborhood search strategy based on similarity and uses Mahalanobis distance and the law of universal gravitation to calculate and rank the similarity of solutions. At the same time, the algorithm counts the times of convergence oscillation. According to the algorithm iteration process, it selects the corresponding similarity ranking solution as the object to update the position and performs the second position update for the solution with most times of oscillation, so as to implement the space exploration of the target population to speed up the convergence of the algorithm and enhance the ability to jump out of the local optimum. Finally, an adaptive step size adjustment strategy is introduced, and the population convergence is adjusted using adaptive step size parameters according to the algorithm optimization process to improve the algorithm's global search performance and avoid premature convergence of the algorithm. The improved algorithm proposed in this paper is analyzed and compared with the sine-cosine optimization algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm and three improved whale algorithms on a set of 20 test functions in low-dimensional and high-dimensional, respectively, and perform ANOVA and T-test on the simulation results. The results show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper effectively improves the convergence accuracy and convergence speed. In addition, the improved optimization algorithm proposed in this paper is applied to the engineering optimization design. The solutions show that the improved algorithm can obtain the optimal value with higher accuracy and more stability than other algorithms, and can effectively solve the engineering design problem.

AB Classification of medical data is largely dependent on the effective identification of key features of the data that can be used to aid in the diagnosis of related diseases. This goal can be achieved through feature selection methods that endeavor to get rid of redundant and irrelevant features to ameliorate classification accuracy. This is the aim of this work where a new meta-heuristic, referred to as snake optimizer, was adopted for the purpose of boosting the performance of existing feature selection methods. This optimizer may smoothly fall into local optimal solutions, which may present weak search performance and slow convergence speeds in handling feature selection problems. On this basis, this paper presents three improved adaptive versions of this optimizer, each of which has increased search performance over the basic optimizer. This optimizer was improved using three mathematical models named exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped, to create three methods, referred to as exponential, power, and delayed S-shaped snake optimizers, respectively. These proposed versions were also matured to have more balance between exploration and exploitation aspects. Then, binary variants of these optimizers were evolved to solve feature selection problems using the k-nearest neighbor classifier. To verify the efficacy of these binary optimizers, 24 datasets were used, and then compared with other feature selection optimizers. The experimental results obviously manifested the efficiency of the proposed optimizers in realizing the optimal feature set by achieving utmost accuracy and minimal number of features in the majority of the studied datasets. The proposed binary power snake optimizer outperformed all other competitors in 13, 10, 8, 8, and 12 datasets in respect of classification accuracy, number of chosen attributes, specificity, sensitivity, and fitness scores, respectively. Out of the 24 datasets taken into consideration, the results on 12, 6, and 8 datasets, respectively, showed that this proposed optimizer presented performance scores of more than 90% in respect of sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity metrics.

AB Climate change is the greatest threat to humanity, with harmful broad-spectrum impacts to human health and the natural environment. One of the main causes of this change is the greenhouse effect caused by greenhouse gases (GHG). To limit the impact of GHG to the environment, it is necessary to control emissions from human-produced sources. To date, 192 out of 197 parties at the Paris Agreement have approved ratification to reduce GHG in their countries. However, to properly control the emissions of GHG, accurate and precise forecasts of emissions are necessary. A wide variety of statistical models, computational intelligence and experience curves have been applied in an attempt to provide both accurate and precise forecasts. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed that combines a fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA), a probabilistic neural network (PNN), and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), where the first two models seek to exceed both the limitations of the ARIMA models (linear behavior and great need for data) and FARIMA (wide forecast ranges) alone. The ANFIS model is applied to the results of the first two to improve the overall accuracy of the models. We apply the proposed model in the context of eight Latin American countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru and Uruguay). The results show improvement with MAE, RMSE and RMSRE reduced by more than 90% against comparison models. Additionally, when using performance indices such as the Willmott index of agreement, values close to 1 are obtained. It is concluded that the proposed hybrid model reduces the forecast interval width and increases the accuracy of the forecast by applying ANFIS, overcoming the results of FARIMA and PNN alone which delivered precise but not accurate results. Finally, emissions are forecast for 2025 and 2050 in the aforementioned countries, observing that GHG emissions increase in the region without adhering to the Paris Agreement commitments, which indicates the importance of these countries taking measures in order to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In simple assembly line balancing problems, it is assumed that the resources required to perform the tasks are available at the relevant station for task assignment. However, each task may need different resource types depending on the difficulty, complexity and technical requirements of the tasks in real life. For this reason, tasks and resources belonging to these tasks must be assigned to the relevant station while balancing the line. In this study, the resource-constrained U-shaped assembly line balancing problem (U-GRCALBP) is discussed. According to the literature research, there is no study dealing with U-GRCALBP. Two different constraint programming (CP) models that define the resource constraints as "and/or" constraint types with concurrent resource types have been developed. In these models, the sum of resource usage costs and station opening cost minimization is aimed. The models are explained with an illustrative example and the efficiency of the models is tested by deriving new resource constraints on five different data set each taking into account four different cycle times and the number of two and four resource types. The number of stations obtained, the total number of resources used, total station opening and resource usage costs, and CPU time are used as performance criteria The results are compared with the traditional U-type assembly line balancing problem results. The proposed CP models give superior performance on all data sets, especially in terms of total cost. The numerical results show that both CP models are effective in solving the problem. Furthermore, some managerial implications are presented to be useful for professionals, organizations, and society.

AB The approximate degree reduction of ball NURBS curves is a knotty technique in geometric modeling. As is known to all, the degree reduction of ball NURBS ones is mathematically an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently by swarm intelligence algorithm. In this paper, an improved artificial rabbits optimization (ARO) is used to accomplish the optimal multi-degree reduction of the ball curves. Firstly, by incorporating mutation strategy, adaptive group strategy and Elite-feedback strategy to the ARO, the improved ARO named IARO is developed to increase the population diversity and enhance its capability of jumping out of the local minima. Secondly, the superiority of IARO is comprehensively verified by comparing with the original ARO and numerous celebrated and newly developed algorithms on the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC, for short) 2017 benchmark functions. Meanwhile, the statistical testing of IARO has been conducted to validate its significance. Finally, by minimizing the distance between the original curve and the approximate curve, the optimization models of multi-degree reduction for ball NURBS curves are established. The IARO is utilized to solve the optimization models, and the optimal approximate ball NURBS curves are obtained. Some representative numerical examples illustrate the ability of the proposed IARO in effectively solving the multi-degree reduction problem of ball NURBS curves in terms of precision, robustness, and convergence characteristics.

AB This research paper presents an innovative approach by hybridizing the Whale Optimization Algorithm-WOA and the Simulated Annealing-SA, named as h-WOA-SA algorithm. The preeminence of the projected hybridized algorithm is evaluated over the basic form, modified form and some popular algorithms in respect of computation time and eminence in the tuning of fitness function by considering various standard test functions. Further, the hybrid algorithm is utilized for the scaling of interval type-2 fuzzy fractional order PID-IT2F-FO-PID controller engaged in load frequency control-LFC of hybrid power system-HPS. It presents a strategy to manage the critical challenges encountered due to the penetration of solar & wind power for their operational dynamics. The sturdiness of the hybrid technique based controller is examined in the HPS. The unrivalled superiority of the proposed approach has been validated by contrasting some recent research outcomes and with a real-time validation which justifies the effectiveness in improved performance as compared to the traditional approaches.

AB The electric power system must supply energy with quality, security, and reliability. However, the system can operate close to its critical limits due to environmental or economic reasons. Under these circumstances, voltage instability problems, which have been the cause of several significant blackouts worldwide in the last two decades, are prone to happen due to increasing power demand. For this reason, guaranteeing an acceptable voltage security margin is crucial for a safe and reliable power system operation. Over the years, many studies have been made to identify and control voltage instability problems, where voltage stability margin is a parameter used to identify these problems, calculated through continuation power flow. Besides that, to prevent or correct these problems, preventive or corrective controls may be used, such as capacitor switching, for example. Within this context, this paper proposes a method capable of defining a list of capacitor sets that mitigate the criticality of a set of contingencies and maximize the voltage stability margin of the power system under analysis as its main contribution. A continuation power flow embedded in a binary differential evolution algorithm calculates the voltage stability margin. This margin is optimized by selecting capacitor banks to be switched on/off after the contingency. The output of the method can be presented in a suitable format to the system operator, enabling fast choices of corrective control actions after detecting a contingency in real-time operation.

AB Energy-awareness in the industrial sectors has become a global consensus in recent decades. Green scheduling is acknowledged as an effective weapon to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sectors. Therefore, this paper is devoted to the green scheduling of flexible manufacturing cells (FMC) with auto-guided vehicle transportation, where conflict-free routing of the vehicles is considered. To deal with this problem, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to achieve the minimization of the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption in an FMC. The studied problem is an extension of flexible job shop problem which is NP-hard. Thus, an improved bi-objective salp swarm algorithm based on decomposition (IMOSSA/D) is proposed and applied to the problem. The approach is based on the decomposition of the bi-objective problem. Salp swarm intelligence along with three stochastic-distribution-based operators are incorporated into the approach, to enhance and balance its exploring and exploiting ability. Computational experiments are performed to compare the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art algorithms. This study allows the decision makers to better trade-off between energy savings and production efficiency in flexible manufacturing cellular environment.

AB This article addresses distributed robust learning-based control for consensus formation tracking of multiple underwater vessels, in which the system parameters of the marine vessels are assumed to be entirely unknown and subject to the modeling mismatch, oceanic disturbances, and noises. Toward this end, graph theory is used to allow us to synthesize the distributed controller with a stability guarantee. Due to the fact that the parameter uncertainties only arise in the vessels' dynamic model, the backstepping control technique is then employed. Subsequently, to overcome the difficulties in handling time-varying and unknown systems, an online learning procedure is developed in the proposed distributed formation control protocol. Moreover, modeling errors, environmental disturbances, and measurement noises are considered and tackled by introducing a neurodynamics model in the controller design to obtain a robust solution. Then, the stability analysis of the overall closed-loop system under the proposed scheme is provided to ensure the robust adaptive performance at the theoretical level. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are conducted to further verify the efficacy of the presented distributed control protocol.

AB Humans show a remarkable ability in solving the cocktail party problem. Decoding auditory attention from the brain signals is a major step toward the development of bionic ears emulating human capabilities. Electroencephalography (EEG)-based auditory attention detection (AAD) has attracted considerable interest recently. Despite much progress, the performance of traditional AAD decoders remains to be improved, especially in low-latency settings. State-of-the-art AAD decoders based on deep neural networks generally lack the intrinsic temporal coding ability in biological networks. In this study, we first propose a bio-inspired spiking attentional neural network, denoted as BSAnet, for decoding auditory attention. BSAnet is capable of exploiting the temporal dynamics of EEG signals using biologically plausible neurons and an attentional mechanism. Experiments on two publicly available datasets confirm the superior performance of BSAnet over other state-of-the-art systems across various evaluation conditions. Moreover, BSAnet imitates realistic brain-like information processing, through which we show the advantage of brain-inspired computational models.

ID GAUSSIAN PROCESS
AB Multiview learning has made significant progress in recent years. However, an implicit assumption is that multiview data are complete, which is often contrary to practical applications. Due to human or data acquisition equipment errors, what we actually get is partial multiview data, which existing multiview algorithms are limited to processing. Modeling complex dependencies between views in terms of consistency and complementarity remains challenging, especially in partial multiview data scenarios. To address the above issues, this article proposes a deep Gaussian cross-view generation model (named PMvCG), which aims to model views according to the principles of consistency and complementarity and eventually learn the comprehensive representation of partial multiview data. PMvCG can discover cross-view associations by learning view-sharing and view-specific features of different views in the representation space. The missing views can be reconstructed and are applied in turn to further optimize the model. The estimated uncertainty in the model is also considered and integrated into the representation to improve the performance. We design a variational inference and iterative optimization algorithm to solve PMvCG effectively. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets to validate the performance of PMvCG. We compare the PMvCG with various methods by applying the learned representation to clustering and classification. We also provide more insightful analysis to explore the PMvCG, such as convergence analysis, parameter sensitivity analysis, and the effect of uncertainty in the representation. The experimental results indicate that PMvCG obtains promising results and surpasses other comparative methods under different experimental settings.

AB The goal of feature matching is to establish accurate correspondences between feature points in different images depicting the same scene. To address the polymorphism of local structures, the authors propose a mismatch removal method using bilateral local-global structural consistency. This method incorporates the problem of mismatch removal into the framework of graph matching, constructs a global affinity matrix using local structural similarity and global affine transformation consistency, and optimizes it using a constrained integer quadratic programming method. To comprehensively describe the local structure, the signature quadratic form distance (SQFD) is used to measure the consistency of the neighbourhood structure. Specifically, the weights of edges are constructed based on the SQFD of the local structure, while the matching correctness of nodes and edges between the two graphs is described using local vector similarity. Furthermore, the consistency of the global affine transformation is evaluated by assessing the consistency of the local neighbourhood affine transformation between different corresponding point pairs. In estimating the local affine transformation, a bilateral correction is performed using a total least-squares (TLS) algorithm to measure the similarity of nodes between the two different graphs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and effectiveness.

AB More and more organisations are trying to install tool health analytics dashboards for CNC machines to avoid unexpected failures, maintain machining accuracy, and optimise tool change. This paper aims at developing a cyber physical production system framework for a smart tool health management system to prescribe the optimum cutting parameters to managers/operators for optimising the remaining useful life and/or material removal rate at a predefined surface finish (individually or simultaneously). This is achieved by developing (i) a machine learning algorithm to predict the remaining useful life of a cutting tool, (ii) regression models to prescribe optimum cutting parameters (iii) a machine learning algorithm for anomaly detection, and (iv) a knowledge-based system for chip conditions and tool life curves. Experiments are designed and conducted based on Taguchi L-27 orthogonal array with varying combinations of cutting parameters during the milling of a difficult to machine material (AISI H13 tool steel). The effect of cutting parameters is analysed statistically; using analysis of variance (ANOVA), response tables, and main effect plots; to prescribe optimum cutting parameters based on managerial requirements. A novel knowledge-based system is also presented that updates knowledge and information about the chip colour at different health conditions of a tool. The present work will be a significant step towards improving productivity, product quality, and reducing maintenance costs by providing practitioners with an active decision support tool that will assist them to confidently adopt optimum management and control strategies within an Industry 4.0 environment.

AB Broadband mid-infrared spectroscopy not only offers supreme sensitivity for the massively parallel detection of trace gases but also presents many challenges. Herein, a new platform combining the advantages of a mid-infrared dual-comb spectrometer based on two difference-frequency generation combs pumped by femtosecond Er-doped fiber comb oscillators and an unsupervised deep learning neural network consisting of information extraction and information mapping blocks is presented. The scarce data problem, the uncertainties of apparatus, and manual operations intrinsic to multicomponent gas mixture analysis are overcome by coupling an unsupervised leaning approach with a model-agnostic, physics-informed data augmentation strategy using simulated data from spectral databases. The system provides reliable simultaneous identification of gas species, concentration retrieval, as well as ambient pressure prediction and eliminates the negative impacts on the measurement, such as model error, baseline fluctuation, and unknown absorbers. Parallel optical detection of 31 different mixtures of 5 gas species over a 2900-3100 cm(-1) spectral range with a sub part-per-billion sensitivity is demonstrated showing the potential in various applications such as atmospheric monitoring, diagnostics with breath biomarkers, and capturing rapid chemical reaction kinetics.

AB Chest X-ray (CXR) images are widely accepted for the diagnosis of lung diseases. The X-ray machinery is widely available but the number of radiologists who interpret these images is very limited. Therefore, the development of an automated disease classification system is a need for the healthcare industry. The existing testing methods take hours to days to generate the testing result and have low detection accuracy and high false detection rate. Furthermore, the testing kits are costly, and availability is limited. Therefore, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based framework is proposed to address these limitations. Four pre-trained frameworks, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, and Xception are used to generate highly dense features, refine the features using the attention module, and then fused these features to classify the diseases using CXR images. In addition, extensive experiments were carried out on the activation functions (Relu, Leaky Relu, and Tanh), which help to improve the results. Evaluation is done on the three enriched CXR datasets DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3 to examine the performance of the proposed framework in terms of binary classification and multi-class classification. The proposed model achieved a class-5 accuracy of 92.89% on dataset DS-3 and the class-3 classification accuracy of 95.22%, 92.25% on dataset DS-1 and DS-2, respectively. The class-2 classification accuracy on dataset DS-1 and DS-2 is 99.23% and 98.85%, respectively.

AB Linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (Lq-ROFS) is extension of linguistic intuitionistic fuzzy set (LIFS) and linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy set (LPFS) which can depict broader range of evaluation information by the parameter q taking different values. The generalized Shapley bi-direction Choquet integral (GSBDCI) can globally capture the interrelationship between input arguments sets and define the weight of input arguments. So, the aggregation operators (AOs) are proposed based on GSBDCI for Lq-ROFS and used in multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) method. Firstly, the extended Archimedean copulas (EACs) and extended Archimedean co-copulas (EACCs) for linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (Lq-ROFNs) and new operational rules of Lq-ROFNs are introduced. Then the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy generalized Shapley bi-direction Choquet-copula average (Lq-ROFGSBCCA) and linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy generalized Shapley bi-direction Choquet-copula geometric (Lq-ROFGSBCCG) AOs are built to aggregate the evaluation information and can capture the importance of interactive input arguments, and specifical types of the purposed AOs based on different EACs and EACCs are introduced. Finally, a MAGDM method is established which can deal with the decision-making problems (DMPs) with the fuzzy measure (FM) of attributes partly known based on gray relational analysis (GRA) method, the FM information can be obtained from a linear model. And the built MAGDM method is used in practical DMP to illustrate the strengths of the introduced MAGDM approach.

AB The task of remote sensing image object detection in low latency scenes is of great research significance. To address the problem that the current high-precision object detection algorithm based on a feature pyramid network is slow due to a large number of parameters and complicated computation, a fast remote sensing image object detection method based on a Single-scale Feature Transformation Network (SFTN) is proposed. Firstly, based on the single-scale remote sensing image features, the new channel features are quickly generated by a linear transformation of the original features and convolution kernel clustering optimization using cosine similarity; secondly, in order to obtain multi-scale receptive fields, a parallel residual hole convolution module is designed to cover multi-category remote sensing object scales on the feature map; finally, angle variables are introduced and optimized using angle similarity to effectively improve the object orientation accuracy. The experimental results on different datasets show that the method in this paper improves the detection speed rapidly while ensuring the accuracy of remote sensing image object detection, which is better than many remote sensing image object detection methods. The results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of the method.

AB Monitoring beehive health is a major area of interest within the field of honeybee economy. Ensuring beehives are free of problems such as Varroa destructors and hive beetles, ant problems, and missing queen represents an important challenge in the honeybee industry. Therefore, it is mandatory to have untraditional ways to diagnose these types of honeybee attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI), computer vision, and the Internet of Things (IoT) can be integrated to develop smart systems for developing warning, prediction, and recognition systems to analyze beehives' health impacts, and conditions as well as monitor bees' behaviors and the environmental conditions inside/outside beehives. In this paper, a deep learning methodology is proposed to recognize the beehives' health abnormalities, Varroa destructors, hive beetles, ant problems, and missing queens. A novel version of the MobileNet model is developed by modifying the front layers of the mobile net model for performing the features selection phase. Three optimization algorithms are utilized and tested on a benchmark dataset of beehives, Adam optimizer, Nesterov-accelerated Adam (Nadam) optimizer, and Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for selecting the most important features to recognize the three beehive health abnormalities. The implementation and validation results proved the efficiency of the Mobile Net using Adam optimizer in classifying beehives according to the three beehive health abnormalities (Varroa destructor and hive beetles, ant problems, and missing queen) where the model achieved testing accuracy of 95% and testing loss of 35%. In addition, the validation and comparison results confirmed the superiority of Mobile Net using ADAM optimizer in recognizing beehive health abnormalities compared to four deep learning models, Shuffle Net, Resent 50, VGG-19, and Google Net.

AB DeepFake may have a crucial impact on people's lives and reduce the trust in digital media, so DeepFake detection methods have developed rapidly. Most existing detection methods rely on single-space features (mostly RGB features), and there is still relatively little research on multi-space feature fusion. At the same time, a lot of existing methods used a single receptive field, which leads to models that cannot extract information of different scales. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a two-stream Xception network structure (Tception) that fused RGB spatial feature and noise-space feature. This network structure consists of two main parts. The first part is a feature fusion module, which can adaptively fuse RGB feature and noise-space feature generated by RGB images through SRM filters. The second part is the two-stream network structure, which utilizes a parallel structure of convolutional kernels of different sizes allowing the network to learn features of different scales. The experiments show that the proposed method improves performance compared to the Xception network. Compared to SSTNet, the detection accuracy of the Neural Textures is improved by nearly 8%.

AB Safe and human-like trajectory planning is crucial for self-driving cars. While model-based planning has demonstrated reliability, it is beneficial to incorporate human demonstrations and align the results with human behaviors. This work aims at bridging the gap between model-based planning and driver imitation by proposing a constraint imitative trajectory planning method (CITP). CITP integrates artificial potential field and dynamic movement primitives, which have achieved both the ability to imitate human demonstrations as well as ensure safety constraints. During the planning process, CITP first encodes human demonstrations, local driving target, and traffic obstacles as attractive or repulsive effects, and then the trajectory planning problem is solved through model predictive optimization. To address the dynamics of traffic scenarios, a hierarchical planning strategy is proposed based on the division of planning process. CITP is designed with five modules, including LSTM-based target generation, encoding attractive and repulsive effects with target, demonstrations and obstacles, and trajectory planning with model predictive optimization. Data collection and experiments are carried out based on CARLA driving simulator, and the effectiveness in terms of both safety and consistency with human behavior are reported.

AB Reconstructing the trajectory from the static image of handwritten ink traces is useful in many practical applications envisaging handwriting analysis and recognition from offline data, as it allows the use of methods, algorithms, and tools that deal with online data, achieving better results than those achieved on offline data. In this work, the trajectory recovery is addressed by combining a general graph traversal algorithm with knowledge about the processes involved in human learning of motor skills to perform voluntary and complex movements. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been quantitatively and extensively evaluated on large and publicly available datasets, containing English and French multi-stroke words and isolated characters. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing ones in terms of Root Mean Square Error and Dynamic Time Warping distance between the recovered trajectories and the actual ones. Furthermore, an "off-the-shelf" online recognition system provided with the trajectory recovered from offline samples showed an overall reduction of 6.8% with respect to the recognition rate achieved by the system when provided with online data; the reduction, however, drops to 2.4% once preprocessing errors are not taken into account.

AB In view of the soaring demand of highly scalable and energy-efficient neuron devices for future neuromorphic computing, this work demonstrates a novel double-gate ferroelectric junctionless field effect transistor (DG-FE-JLFET) neuron in 20 nm technology node. The proposed device has a homogenously doped structure with GaAs as channel material and HfZrO2 as gate oxide. Using the calibrated simulations in Atlas TCAD, it is confirmed that the proposed neuron accurately mimics the spiking behavior of the biological neuron with an energy consumption of 24 aJ/spike, which is similar to 10(5) folds lesser than the previously proposed single transistor neurons. The proposed design does not need additional circuitry to operate. This greatly simplifies design complexity and can also achieve higher neuron density which is important for designing large scale integration neuromorphic chips. In contrast to the previously reported JLFET neurons that work on impact ionization phenomenon, DG-FE-JLFET works on tunnelling mechanism that eradicates the need to create virtual potential well to accommodate charge carriers in the body. Finally, to validate the practical applicability, the proposed neuron has been explored for image classification with an accuracy of 93.28%.

AB In order to classify linearly non-separable data, neurons are typically organized into multi-layer neural networks that are equipped with at least one hidden layer. Inspired by some recent discoveries in neuroscience, we propose a new model of artificial neuron along with a novel activation function enabling the learning of nonlinear decision boundaries using a single neuron. We show that a standard neuron followed by our novel apical dendrite activation (ADA) can learn the XOR logical function with 100% accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on six benchmark data sets from computer vision, signal processing and natural language processing, i.e. MOROCO, UTKFace, CREMA-D, Fashion-MNIST, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, showing that the ADA and the leaky ADA functions provide superior results to Rectified Linear Units (ReLU), leaky ReLU, RBF and Swish, for various neural network architectures, e.g. one-hidden-layer or two-hidden-layer multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as LeNet, VGG, ResNet and Character-level CNN. We obtain further performance improvements when we change the standard model of the neuron with our pyramidal neuron with apical dendrite activations (PyNADA).

AB Machine learning algorithms often require large training sets to perform well, but labeling such large amounts of data is not always feasible, as in many applications, substantial human effort and material cost is needed. Finding effective ways to reduce the size of training sets while maintaining the same performance is then crucial: one wants to choose the best sample of fixed size to be labeled among a given population, aiming at an accurate prediction of the response. This challenge has been studied in detail in classification, but not deeply enough in regression, which is known to be a more difficult task for active learning despite its need in practice. Few model-free active learning methods have been proposed that detect the new samples to be labeled using unlabeled data, but they lack the information of the conditional distribution between the response and the features. In this paper, we propose a standard regression tree-based active learning method for regression that improves significantly upon existing active learning approaches. It provides impressive results for small and large training sets and an appreciably low variance within several runs. We also exploit model-free approaches, and adapt them to our algorithm to utilize maximum information. Through experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our framework improves existing methods and is effective in learning a regression model from a very limited labeled dataset, reducing the sample size for a fixed level of performance, even with many features.

AB In this paper, we are committed to establishing a unified and end-to-end multi-modal network via exploring language-guided visual recognition. To approach this target, we first propose a novel multi-modal convolution module called Language-guided Dynamic Convolution (LaConv). Its convolution kernels are dynamically generated based on natural language information, which can help extract differentiated visual features for different multi-modal examples. Based on the LaConv module, we further build a fully language-driven convolution network, termed as LaConvNet, which can unify the visual recognition and multi-modal reasoning in one forward structure. To validate LaConv and LaConvNet, we conduct extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets of three vision-and-language tasks, i.e., visual question answering, referring expression comprehension and segmentation. The experimental results not only show the competitive or better performance of LaConvNet against existing multi-modal networks, but also witness the merits of LaConvNet as an unified structure, including compact network, low computational cost and high generalization ability.

AB Networked auxiliary information (e.g., user social network, item transition network, etc.) plays a significant role to alleviate the sparse behavioral information (e.g., click, purchase, rating, etc.) in recent recommender systems, which promotes auxiliary information-enhanced recommendation (AIER) to be flourishing. However, existing studies on AIER-treated auxiliary information and behavioral information independently and ignored complex relationships between two types of information, which leads to suboptimal recommendation performance. Toward to this end, we propose hierarchical interactive graph neural networks, short for Hi-GNN, for AIER. Specifically, we firstly learn the behavioral information and the auxiliary information from user and item sides by recursively performing graph neural networks. And then, we design the hierarchical interaction layer to model the relative importance and the mutual association between the behavioral information and the auxiliary information, which furthermore improves performance of AIER by more rationally integrating networked auxiliary information. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that Hi-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on recommendation performance and has better resistance to sparse data.

AB In high-resolution remote sensing images, the problems of large scale variation, large intra-class variance of background, small variability and irregularity of arrangement between different targets always exist in remote sensing images, making the modeling between targets and background more difficult and the target detection task more difficult. However, general target detection methods mainly use convolutional layers of different scales to enhance the target's perceptual domain and fuse different scale features to solve the scale variation problem, without considering the other two problems prevalent in remote sensing scenes of earth observation. In order to solve the above two problems, this paper proposes a semantic correction and focusing network (SCFNet) from the perspective of modeling the relationship between background and target and target to target. The network consists of two core modules the Local Correction Module (LCM) calculates the similarity of local features through the global features of the image to correct the local features and exclude the non-relevant The Non-local Focus Module (NLFM) enhances the recognition of target features by obtaining the non-local dependencies and the corrected local features from the LCM. To demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on two publicly popular large remote sensing multi-target detection datasets, namely DIOR and DOTA. the experimental results show that our SCFNet achieves best-inclass performance and significant accuracy improvement on the datasets.

SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

DT Article
ID ALGORITHM
AB Many NLP algorithms have been described in terms of deduction systems. Unweighted deduction allows a generic forward-chaining execution strategy. For weighted deduction, however, efficient execution should propagate the weight of each item only after it has converged. This means visiting the items in topologically sorted order (as in dynamic programming). Toposorting is fast on a materialized graph; unfortunately, materializing the graph would take extra space. Is there a generic weighted deduction strategy which, for every acyclic deduction system and every input, uses only a constant factor more time and space than generic unweighted deduction? After reviewing past strategies, we answer this question in the affirmative by combining ideas of Goodman (1999) and Kahn (1962). We also give an extension to cyclic deduction systems, based on Tarjan (1972).

TI Conditional Generation with a Question-Answering Blueprint
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

DT Article
ID DISCOURSE; COHERENCE
AB The ability to convey relevant and faithful information is critical for many tasks in conditional generation and yet remains elusive for neural seq-to-seq models whose outputs often reveal hallucinations and fail to correctly cover important details. In this work, we advocate planning as a useful intermediate representation for rendering conditional generation less opaque and more grounded. We propose a new conceptualization of text plans as a sequence of question-answer (QA) pairs and enhance existing datasets (e.g., for summarization) with a QA blueprint operating as a proxy for content selection (i.e., what to say) and planning (i.e., in what order). We obtain blueprints automatically by exploiting state-of-the-art question generation technology and convert input-output pairs into input-blueprint-output tuples. We develop Transformer-based models, each varying in how they incorporate the blueprint in the generated output (e.g., as a global plan or iteratively). Evaluation across metrics and datasets demonstrates that blueprint models are more factual than alternatives which do not resort to planning and allow tighter control of the generation output.

TI Collective Human Opinions in Semantic Textual Similarity
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the subjective nature of semantic textual similarity (STS) and pervasive disagreements in STS annotation, existing benchmarks have used averaged human ratings as gold standard. Averaging masks the true distribution of human opinions on examples of low agreement, and prevents models from capturing the semantic vagueness that the individual ratings represent. In this work, we introduce USTS, the first Uncertainty-aware STS dataset with & SIM;15,000 Chinese sentence pairs and 150,000 labels, to study collective human opinions in STS. Analysis reveals that neither a scalar nor a single Gaussian fits a set of observed judgments adequately. We further show that current STS models cannot capture the variance caused by human disagreement on individual instances, but rather reflect the predictive confidence over the aggregate dataset.

TI Design Choices for Crowdsourcing Implicit Discourse Relations: Revealing
   the Biases Introduced by Task Design
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID AGREEMENT; TAXONOMY
AB Disagreement in natural language annotation has mostly been studied from a perspective of biases introduced by the annotators and the annotation frameworks. Here, we propose to analyze another source of bias-task design bias, which has a particularly strong impact on crowdsourced linguistic annotations where natural language is used to elicit the interpretation of lay annotators. For this purpose we look at implicit discourse relation annotation, a task that has repeatedly been shown to be difficult due to the relations' ambiguity. We compare the annotations of 1,200 discourse relations obtained using two distinct annotation tasks and quantify the biases of both methods across four different domains. Both methods are natural language annotation tasks designed for crowdsourcing. We show that the task design can push annotators towards certain relations and that some discourse relation senses can be better elicited with one or the other annotation approach. We also conclude that this type of bias should be taken into account when training and testing models.

TI Communication Drives the Emergence of Language Universals in Neural
   Agents: Evidence from the Word-order/Case-marking Trade-off
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION; LEARNERS
AB Artificial learners often behave differently from human learners in the context of neural agent-based simulations of language emergence and change. A common explanation is the lack of appropriate cognitive biases in these learners. However, it has also been proposed that more naturalistic settings of language learning and use could lead to more human-like results. We investigate this latter account, focusing on the word-order/case-marking trade-off, a widely attested language universal that has proven particularly hard to simulate. We propose a new Neural-agent Language Learning and Communication framework (NeLLCom) where pairs of speaking and listening agents first learn a miniature language via supervised learning, and then optimize it for communication via reinforcement learning. Following closely the setup of earlier human experiments, we succeed in replicating the trade-off with the new framework without hard-coding specific biases in the agents. We see this as an essential step towards the investigation of language universals with neural learners.

ID DEPENDENCY LENGTH; SPEAKERS; UNIVERSALS; REDUNDANCY; GRAMMARS; LOCALITY
AB While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and word order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic statistical patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort to identify these pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual word orders. Yet one functional pressure has been overlooked in such investigations: The uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which holds that information should be spread evenly throughout an utterance. Here, we ask whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order patterns cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test whether real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders. In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i) among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual orders consistently exceed the uniformity of real orders. These findings are compatible with a pressure for information uniformity in the development and usage of natural languages.(1)

TI Cross-functional Analysis of Generalization in Behavioral Learning
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB In behavioral testing, system functionalities underrepresented in the standard evaluation setting (with a held-out test set) are validated through controlled input-output pairs. Optimizing performance on the behavioral tests during training (behavioral learning) would improve coverage of phenomena not sufficiently represented in the i.i.d. data and could lead to seemingly more robust models. However, there is the risk that the model narrowly captures spurious correlations from the behavioral test suite, leading to overestimation and misrepresentation of model performance-one of the original pitfalls of traditional evaluation.In this work, we introduce BeLUGA, an analysis method for evaluating behavioral learning considering generalization across dimensions of different granularity levels. We optimize behavior-specific loss functions and evaluate models on several partitions of the behavioral test suite controlled to leave out specific phenomena. An aggregate score measures generalization to unseen functionalities (or overfitting). We use BeLUGA to examine three representative NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, paraphrase identification, and reading comprehension) and compare the impact of a diverse set of regularization and domain generalization methods on generalization performance.(1)

TI Exploring Contrast Consistency of Open-Domain Question Answering Systems
   on Minimally Edited Questions
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Contrast consistency, the ability of a model to make consistently correct predictions in the presence of perturbations, is an essential aspect in NLP. While studied in tasks such as sentiment analysis and reading comprehension, it remains unexplored in open-domain question answering (OpenQA) due to the difficulty of collecting perturbed questions that satisfy factuality requirements. In this work, we collect minimally edited questions as challenging contrast sets to evaluate OpenQA models. Our collection approach combines both human annotation and large language model generation. We find that the widely used dense passage retriever (DPR) performs poorly on our contrast sets, despite fitting the training set well and performing competitively on standard test sets. To address this issue, we introduce a simple and effective query-side contrastive loss with the aid of data augmentation to improve DPR training. Our experiments on the contrast sets demonstrate that DPR's contrast consistency is improved without sacrificing its accuracy on the standard test sets.(1)

DE Index Terms-Camouflaged object detection; large scale-variation;
   interactive learning
AB Camouflaged object detection (COD), with the task of separating the camouflaged object from its color/texture similar background, has been widely used in the fields of medical diagnosis and military reconnaissance. However, the COD task is still a challenging problem due to two main difficulties: large scale-variation for different camouflaged objects, and extreme similarity between the camouflaged object and its background. To address these problems, a cross-level interaction network based on scale-aware augmentation (CINet) for the COD task is proposed. Specifically, a scale-aware augmentation module (SAM) is firstly designed to perceive the scales information of the camouflaged object by calculating an optimal receptive field. Furthermore, a cross-level interaction module (CLIM) is proposed to facilitate the interaction of scale information at all levels, and the context of the feature maps is enriched accordingly. Finally, with the purpose of fully utilizing these features, we design a dual-branch feature decoder (DFD) to strengthen the connection between the predictions at each level. Extensive experiments performed on four CODdatasets, e.g., CHAMELEON, CAMO, COD10K, and NC4K, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CINet compared with 21 existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Action recognition from temporal multivariate sequences of features, such as identifying human actions, is typically approached by supervised training as it requires many ground truth annotations to reach high recognition accuracy. Unsupervised methods for the organization of sequences into clusters have been introduced, however, such methods continue to require annotations to associate clusters with actions. The challenges in annotation necessitate an effective classification methodology that minimizes the required number of labels. Active learning (AL) approaches have been proposed to address these challenges and were able to establish robust results on image classification. Such approaches are not directly applicable to sequences, since for sequences, the variations are in both spatial and temporal domains. In this brief, we introduce a novel method for AL for sequences, called "AL-SAR," which combines unsupervised training with sparsely supervised annotation. In particular, AL-SAR employs a multi-head mechanism for robust uncertainty evaluation of the latent space learned by an encoder-decoder framework. It aims to iteratively select a sparse set of samples, which annotation contributes the most to the disentanglement of the latent space. We evaluate our system on common benchmark datasets with multiple sequences and actions, such as NW-UCLA, NTU RGB+D 60, and UWA3D. Our results indicate that AL-SAR coupled with encoder-decoder network outperforms other AL methods coupled with the same network structure.

AB Data redundancy is frequently encountered in biologically data. Locality preserving projection (LPP) is a dimensionality reduction approach to mitigate the data redundancy while preserving the substantial geometry inspired by biological processes. Its application can contribute promisingly to the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. However, the existing locality preserving based FCM clustering methods that combine LPP with FCM focus only on the local information, probably resulting in somewhat conservatism. A novel FCM clustering method, namely, projected fuzzy double c-means clustering using sparse self-representation (PFD SSR), is developed in this paper. The main idea of PFD SSR is three-fold: (1) Inspired by biological processes, a so-called sparse self-representation (SSR) method is employed. Hence, the global data distribution is investigated so as to enhance the clustering performance; (2) LPP is utilized to handle both the raw data and the dictionary matrix obtained by SSR, which greatly reduces the feature dimensions and solidly preserves the intrinsic data distribution. In addition, the regularization terms of these two achievements under projection are introduced to the FCM's objective function, which helps reduce the risk of being trapped into local optima during the model training; and (3) the alternative direction technique is applied to learn the model. The experimental results on 11 datasets including 6 biologically data sets demonstrated the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art clustering methods. The proposed subspace clustering method has a good ability of handling the high-dimensional data, especially biological data.

AB Neural architecture search (NAS) has been demonstrated to be promising in deep learning for text classification. Most existing NAS algorithms, however, are proposed for single-language text classification. They may become ineffective when extended to multilingual text classification because the differences in the syntactic structure and contextual semantics of different languages increase the computational complexity of NAS search. To address the above issue, this article proposes a differential neural architecture search approach using multi-hashing embedding for multilingual text representation. A multi-hashing network capable of processing heterogeneous graph information is constructed so that cross-language syntactic and contextual semantic information can be effectively represented. In addition, a neural tensor network with multi-hashing embedding is adopted as a continuous encoder to estimate the probability for each candidate operation in the search space, and reparameterization-based gradient search is employed to efficiently search for network architectures for multilingual text representation. Our experimental results on two multilingual text classification datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art NAS methods for text classification in terms of both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB The inherent ambiguity in ground-truth annotations of 3D bounding boxes, caused by occlusions, signal missing, or manual annotation errors, can confuse deep 3D object detectors during training, thus deteriorating detection accuracy. However, existing methods overlook such issues to some extent and treat the labels ass deterministic. In this paper, we formulate the label uncertainty problem as the diversity of potentially plausible bounding boxes of objects. Then, we propose GLENet, a generative framework adapted from conditional variational autoencoders, to model the one-to-many relationship between a typical 3D object and its potential ground-truth bounding boxes with latent variables. The label uncertainty generated by GLENet is a plug-and-play module and can be conveniently integrated into existing deep 3D detectors to build probabilistic detectors and supervise the learning of the localization uncertainty. Besides, we propose an uncertainty-aware quality estimator architecture in probabilistic detectors to guide the training of the IoU-branch with predicted localization uncertainty. We incorporate the proposed methods into various popular base 3D detectors and demonstrate significant and consistent performance gains on both KITTI and Waymo benchmark datasets. Especially, the proposed GLENet-VR outperforms all published LiDAR-based approaches by a large margin and achieves the top rank among single-modal methods on the challenging KITTI test set. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Eaphan/GLENet.

AB The purpose of this research is to explore the acceptance of social robots as companions. Understanding what affects the acceptance of humanoid companions may give society tools that will help people overcome loneliness throughout pandemics, such as COVID-19 and beyond. Based on regulatory focus theory, it is proposed that there is a relationship between goal-directed motivation and acceptance of robots as companions. The theory of regulatory focus posits that goal-directed behavior is regulated by two motivational systems-promotion and prevention. People with a promotion focus are concerned about accomplishments, are sensitive to the presence and absence of positive outcomes (gains/non-gains), and have a strategic preference for eager means of goal-pursuit. People with a prevention focus are concerned about security and safety, are sensitive to the absence and presence of negative outcomes (non-losses/losses), and have a strategic preference for vigilant means. Two studies support the notion of a relationship between acceptance of robots as companions and regulatory focus. In Study 1, chronic promotion focus was associated with acceptance of robots, and this association was mediated by loneliness. The weaker the promotion focus, the stronger was the sense of loneliness, and thus the higher was the acceptance of the robots. In Study 2, a situationally induced regulatory focus moderated the association between acceptance of robots and COVID-19 perceived severity. The higher the perceived severity of the disease, the higher was the willingness to accept the robots, and the effect was stronger for an induced prevention (vs. promotion) focus. Models of acceptance of robots are presented. Implications for well-being are discussed.

AB Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for expensive optimization problems have gained considerable attention in recent years. In many real-world optimization problems, we may face expensive optimization problems with multiple optimal solutions. Locating multiple optima for such expensive problems is qualitatively challenging. This study proposes a surrogate-assisted differential evolution based on region decomposition to seek multiple optima for expensive multimodal optimization problems. In this study, we have designed three major components: 1) the adaptive region decomposition, 2) the multilayer perceptron-based global surrogate, and 3) the self-adaptive gradient descent-based local search. First, the improved adaptive region decomposition detects promising subregions at the beginning phase, and continuously discards inferior subregions successively. Second, the multilayer perceptron-based surrogate and self-adaptive gradient-based mutation work in a collaborative manner on distinct sub-populations to seek multiple optimal solutions. Overall, an attempt has been made to solve expensive multimodal optimization problems. Systematic experiments on 20 test functions show the encouraging and promising performance of our proposed approach.

ID VALIDATION
AB We address the problem of detecting distribution changes in a novel batch-wise and multimodal setup. This setup is characterized by a stationary condition where batches are drawn from potentially different modalities among a set of distributions in Rd represented in the training set. Existing change detection (CD) algorithms assume that there is a unique-possibly multipeaked-distribution characterizing stationary conditions, and in batch-wise multimodal context exhibit either low detection power or poor control of false positives. We present MultiModal QuantTree (MMQT), a novel CD algorithm that uses a single histogram to model the batch-wise multimodal stationary conditions. During testing, MMQT automatically identifies which modality has generated the incoming batch and detects changes by means of a modality-specific statistic. We leverage the theoretical properties of QuantTree to: 1) automatically estimate the number of modalities in a training set and 2) derive a principled calibration procedure that guarantees false-positive control. Our experiments show that MMQT achieves high detection power and accurate control over false positives in synthetic and real-world multimodal CD problems. Moreover, we show the potential of MMQT in Stream Learning applications, where it proves effective at detecting concept drifts and the emergence of novel classes by solely monitoring the input distribution.

DE Causal transformer; feature representation; model-based reinforcement
   learning (MBRL); state abstraction
AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL) typically requires a tremendous number of training samples, which are not practical in many applications. State abstraction and world models are two promising approaches for improving sample efficiency in deep RL. However, both state abstraction and world models may degrade the learning performance. In this article, we propose an abstracted model-based policy learning (AMPL) algorithm, which improves the sample efficiency of deep RL. In AMPL, a novel state abstraction method via multistep bisimulation is first developed to learn task-related latent state spaces. Hence, the original Markov decision processes (MDPs) are compressed into abstracted MDPs. Then, a causal transformer model predictor (CTMP) is designed to approximate the abstracted MDPs and generate long-horizon simulated trajectories with a smaller multistep prediction error. Policies are efficiently learned through these trajectories within the abstracted MDPs via a modified multistep soft actor-critic algorithm with a $\lambda$ -target. Moreover, theoretical analysis shows that the AMPL algorithm can improve sample efficiency during the training process. On Atari games and the DeepMind Control (DMControl) suite, AMPL surpasses current state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency. Furthermore, DMControl tasks with moving noises are conducted, and the results demonstrate that AMPL is robust to task-irrelevant observational distractors and significantly outperforms the existing approaches.

AB This article studies the informative trajectory planning problem of an autonomous vehicle for field exploration. In contrast to existing works concerned with maximizing the amount of information about spatial fields, this work considers efficient exploration of spatiotemporal fields with unknown distributions and seeks minimum-time trajectories of the vehicle while respecting a cumulative information constraint. In this work, upon adopting the observability constant as an information measure for expressing the cumulative information constraint, the existence of a minimum-time trajectory is proven under mild conditions. Given the spatiotemporal nature, the problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), for which a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed to learn a continuous planning policy. To accelerate the policy learning, we design a new reward function by leveraging field approximations, which is demonstrated to yield dense rewards. Simulations show that the learned policy can steer the vehicle to achieve an efficient exploration, and it outperforms the commonly-used coverage planning method in terms of exploration time for sufficient cumulative information.

DE Byzantine attacks; centralized training and decentralized execution
   (CTDE); multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)
AB In this article, we consider centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) with diverse and private reward functions in cooperative multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). The main challenge is that an unknown number of agents, whose identities are also unknown, can deliberately generate malicious messages and transmit them to the central controller. We term these malicious actions as Byzantine attacks. First, without Byzantine attacks, we propose a reward-free deep deterministic policy gradient (RF-DDPG) algorithm, in which gradients of agents' critics rather than rewards are sent to the central controller for preserving privacy. Second, to cope with Byzantine attacks, we develop a robust extension of RF-DDPG termed R2F-DDPG, which replaces the vulnerable average aggregation rule with robust ones. We propose a novel class of RL-specific Byzantine attacks that fail conventional robust aggregation rules, motivating the projection-boosted robust aggregation rules for R2F-DDPG. Numerical experiments show that RF-DDPG successfully trains agents to work cooperatively and that R2F-DDPG demonstrates robustness to Byzantine attacks.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have captivated the attention worldwide owing to their compelling advantages in low power consumption, high biological plausibility, and strong robustness. However, the intrinsic latency associated with SNNs during inference poses a significant challenge, impeding their further development and application. This latency is caused by the need for spiking neurons to collect electrical stimuli and generate spikes only when their membrane potential exceeds a firing threshold. Considering the firing threshold plays a crucial role in SNN performance, this article proposes a self-driven adaptive threshold plasticity (SATP) mechanism, wherein neurons autonomously adjust the firing thresholds based on their individual state information using unsupervised learning rules, of which the adjustment is triggered by their own firing events. SATP is based on the principle of maximizing the information contained in the output spike rate distribution of each neuron. This article derives the mathematical expression of SATP and provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating that SATP effectively reduces SNN inference latency, further reduces the computation density while improving computational accuracy, so that SATP facilitates SNN models to be with low latency, sparse computing, and high accuracy.

ID NETWORK
AB It is attractive to extract plausible 3-D information from a single 2-D image, and self-supervised learning has shown impressive potential in this field. However, when only monocular videos are available as training data, moving objects at similar speeds to the camera can disturb the reprojection process during training. Existing methods filter out some moving pixels by comparing pixelwise photometric error, but the illumination inconsistency between frames leads to incomplete filtering. In addition, existing methods calculate photometric error within local windows, which leads to the fact that even if an anomalous pixel is masked out, it can still implicitly disturb the reprojection process, as long as it is in the local neighborhood of a nonanomalous pixel. Moreover, the ill-posed nature of monocular depth estimation makes the same scene correspond to multiple plausible depth maps, which damages the robustness of the model. In order to alleviate the above problems, we propose: 1) a self-reprojection mask to further filter out moving objects while avoiding illumination inconsistency; 2) a self-statistical mask method to prevent the filtered anomalous pixels from implicitly disturbing the reprojection; and 3) a self-distillation augmentation consistency loss to reduce the impact of ill-posed nature of monocular depth estimation. Our method shows superior performance on the KITTI dataset, especially when evaluating only the depth of potential moving objects.

AB Recent developments in text style transfer have led this field to be more highlighted than ever. There are many challenges associated with transferring the style of input text such as fluency and content preservation that need to be addressed. In this research, we present PGST, a novel Persian text style transfer approach in the gender domain, composed of different constituent elements. Established on the significance of parts of speech tags, our method is the first that successfully transfers the gendered linguistic style of Persian text. We have proceeded with a pre-trained word embedding for token replacement purposes, a character-based token classifier for gender exchange purposes, and a beam search algorithm for extracting the most fluent combination. Since different approaches are introduced in our research, we determine a trade-off value for evaluating different models' success in faking our gender identification model with transferred text. Our research focuses primarily on Persian, but since there is no Persian baseline available, we applied our method to a highly studied gender-tagged English corpus and compared it to state-of-the-art English variants to demonstrate its applicability. Our final approach successfully defeated English and Persian gender identification models by 45.6% and 39.2%, respectively.

AB The fixed-time synchronization (FTS) of complex-valued memristive competitive neural networks (CVMCNNs) with mixed delays is the main topic of this paper. Firstly, two new fixed-time (FT) stability criteria are obtained. In the FT stability criterion, the exponent is usually positive, but the exponent can be less than zero and varies with the error state in this paper. Then, based on two new stability theorems, the FTS of CVMCNNs is studied in the sense of 1-norm and 2-norm, respectively, without dividing the complex-valued state variables into the real part (RP) and the imaginary part (IP). Finally, two numerical simulation examples are given to further demonstrate the validity and superiority of our results.

ID DOMAIN ADAPTATION; POPULATION-DENSITY; SEGMENTATION
AB Estimating the number of buildings in any geographical region is a vital component of urban analysis, disaster management, and public policy decision. Deep learning methods for building localization and counting in satellite imagery, can serve as a viable and cheap alternative. However, these algorithms suffer performance degradation when applied to the regions on which they have not been trained. Current large datasets mostly cover the developed regions and collecting such datasets for every region is a costly, time-consuming, and difficult endeavor. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for counting buildings where we use a labeled source domain (developed regions) and adapt the trained model on an unlabeled target domain (developing regions). We initially align distribution maps across domains by aligning the output space distribution through adversarial loss. We then exploit counting consistency constraints, within image count consistency, and across-image count consistency, to decrease the domain shift. Within-image consistency enforces that the building count in the whole image should be greater than or equal to the count in any of its sub-image. Across-image consistency constraint enforces that if an image contains considerably more buildings than the other image, then their sub-images shall also have the same order. These two constraints encourage the behavior to be consistent across and within the images, regardless of the scale. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we collected and annotated a large-scale dataset consisting of challenging South Asian regions having higher building densities and irregular structures as compared to existing datasets. We perform extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of our approach and report improvements of approximately 7-20% over the competitive baseline methods. The dataset and code are available here: https://github.com/intelligentMachines-ITU/domain-Adaptive-Building-Counting.

This brief investigates the problem of time delay and randomly missing data in Boolean networks (BNs). A Bernoulli random variable is assigned to each node to characterize the probability of data packet dropout. Time delay and missing data are modeled by independent random variables. A novel data-sending rule that incorporates both communication constraints is proposed. An augmented system, comprising current states, delayed information, and successfully transmitted data, is established for theoretical analysis. Using the semitensor product (STP), the necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of delayed BNs with random data dropouts is derived. The convergence rate is also obtained.

AB In manufacturing, causal relations between components have become crucial to automate assembly lines. Identifying these relations permits error tracing and correction in the absence of domain experts, in addition to advancing our knowledge about the operating characteristics of a complex system. This paper is motivated by a case study focusing on deciphering the causal structure of a wafer manufacturing system using data from sensors and abnormality monitors deployed within the assembly line. In response to the distinctive characteristics of the wafer manufacturing data, such as multimodality, high-dimensionality, imbalanced classes, and irregular missing patterns, we propose a hierarchical ensemble approach. This method leverages the temporal and domain constraints inherent in the assembly line and provides a measure of uncertainty in causal discovery. We extensively examine its operating characteristics via simulations and validate its effectiveness through simulation experiments and a practical application involving data obtained from Seagate Technology. Domain engineers have cross-validated the learned structures and corroborated the identified causal relationships.

AB This paper explores how to syntactically parse Ancient Greek texts automatically and maps ways of fruitfully employing the results of such an automated analysis. Special attention is given to documentary papyrus texts, a large diachronic corpus of non-literary Greek, which presents a unique set of challenges to tackle. By making use of the Stanford Graph-Based Neural Dependency Parser, we show that through careful curation of the parsing data and several manipulation strategies, it is possible to achieve an Labeled Attachment Score of about 0.85 for this corpus. We also explain how the data can be converted back to its original (Ancient Greek Dependency Treebanks) format. We describe the results of several tests we have carried out to improve parsing results, with special attention paid to the impact of the annotation format on parser achievements. In addition, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis of the remaining errors, including possible ways to solve them. Moreover, the paper gives an overview of the valorisation possibilities of an automatically annotated corpus of Ancient Greek texts in the fields of linguistics, language education and humanities studies in general. The concluding section critically analyses the remaining difficulties and outlines avenues to further improve the parsing quality and the ensuing practical applications.

AB In the context of large group decision-making (LGDM), the opinions of individuals can influence each other due to their trust relationships. So, trust relationships should be deemed as just as important as evaluation information, and they should be considered jointly throughout the LGDM. This study first transforms the trust relationships between decision-makers into an information type, labeled as compromise information, whose form is the same as the evaluation information. The compromise information is utilized to incorporate trust relationships into various stages of the decision-making process, including clustering, weight determination, consensus reaching, and alternative selection. In the expert clustering and weight determination processes, more criteria and factors are considered by considering the compromise information. In the consensus reaching process, an optimization model is built to adjust the evaluation information of clusters to simultaneously guarantee a substantial increase in the global consensus level and minimize the adjustment cost. The compromise information also serves as a reference to limit the range of the adjusted information. An objective method to determine the consensus threshold is proposed. The proposed method is validated through an application example and comparisons, demonstrating its rationality and effectiveness. Simulation results indicate that the proposed consensus reaching method converges regardless of the number of experts, alternatives, and criteria. The proposed method integrates evaluation information and trust relationships into the LGDM process, thereby improving the rationality and scientificity of the decision results.

AB Brain connectivity measures the relationship between brain regions that occur in response to a task (task-related) or in resting state (intrinsic). Although differences in resting-state connectivity are frequently attributed to task-related brain activity, there is currently no valid criterion for directly evaluating task-related connectivity from signal data. This study aims to establish a fuzzy index based on fuzzy Subsethood (FSH) measure for estimating task-related connectivity. First, two sets of simulated time series with linear and nonlinear interactions were used to evaluate the proposed approach. The results of FSH method on simulated data indicate that the fuzzy Subsethood criterion could identify and estimate task-related connectivity. Afterward, an EEG dataset with an SSVEP task in a mobile BCI system was used to test the approach using real-world data. To address the volume conduction effect and the problem of fake connectivity, the signals were first mapped into the domain of independent components using the Fourier-ICA algorithm, and brain connectivity among brain sources was investigated. The FSH approach was then used to estimate task-related connectivity, and a pattern recognition algorithm was used to determine stimulus frequency. The results demonstrated that the FSH approach is robust when modifying the user's speed. Furthermore, at a speed of 2 m/s, the FSH approach significantly outperformed the standard CCA method (79.48% vs. 55%, respectively; p value = 0.0075). Based on the findings, it is possible to conclude that the FSH index is a suitable measure for estimating task-related connectivity.

AB This study addresses the issues of the limited or unavailable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image matching labels, differences in imagery between UAV and ground cameras, and the limited UAV airborne computer memory in UAV visual navigation. To tackle these challenges, a novel unsupervised UAV image matching network called USuperGlue is developed, which leverages local self-attention. The aim is to enhance the precision and recall of the matching process. To achieve this, a local self-attention module is designed to specialize each feature point at the end of the encoding, thereby further improving the matching precision. Subsequently, the encoded features are decoded to extract scores, keypoints, and feature descriptors. During the feature matching stage, an unsupervised matching network is constructed using SuperGlue, a graph neural network that incorporates multi-head attention, to match the feature descriptors of image pairs. The experiment conducted training of the unsupervised network using the Drone dataset and COCO dataset. The simulation results demonstrate that the trained USuperGlue model achieves superior precision and recall, making it a highly effective solution for UAV image matching.

AB The teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is one of the most noted meta-heuristic algorithms known for its simplicity, fast convergence, and accuracy. Several TLBO variants have been suggested to improve the exploitation capability and speed up the exploration process. However, they still suffer from slow conver-gence and local optimum stagnation when solving sophisticated time-cost-environmental impact trade-off (TCET) problems. To tackle this, the study proposes a new brand of TLBO named "golden ratio oppositional TLBO" (GROTLBO), which leverages a novel golden ratio-based opposition learning (GROL) strategy to eliminate premature convergence. The proposed model, instead of employing opposite numbers, employs golden ratio -based opposite numbers for opposition-based population initialization and generation jumping to enrich the diversity and local optimal avoidance. The asymmetric and iteratively changing search space remarkably en-hances the probability of the population achieving the optimal solution, improving the overall exploitation and exploration abilities of GROTLBO. To evaluate its performance, three benchmark problems consisting of 11, 25, and 69-activity projects are examined. The computational experiment results compared with the competitive algorithms show that GROTLBO has a 5% improvement in accuracy. Additionally, GROTLBO was able to considerably reduce the number of scheduling calculations required. These findings suggest that GROTLBO is a promising optimization algorithm that provides robust and high-quality Pareto-optimal solutions in the objective space of the hyper-volume indicator.

AB Low-dose cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is reconstructed from hundreds of 2D X-ray projections of low intensity to reduce ionizing radiation to patients, but its imaging quality suffers from noise degradation. A mainstream solution is the supervised dual-processing method to successively improve the quality of projections and reconstructed CT images based on large amounts of paired normal-dose and low-dose projections, which are often unavailable in clinical practice. Therefore, we present a Pseudo-Supervised Dual-Processing (PSDP) strategy which includes an unpaired-learning Degrading Projection Network (DeProjNet) and a dual-processing network. Specifically, our DeProjNet is implemented with a generative model, and it builds the projection pairs by degrading the normal-dose projections into their pseudo low-dose counterparts. In particular, we develop a two-path adversarial learning into DeProjNet to effectively learn the noise distributions from the real unpaired low-dose projections. To overcome the common challenge of the undesired content deformation while using a generative model, we develop a physics-based content-fidelity loss to constrain the image content of the generated pseudo low-dose projections. A well-performed dual-processing network is integrated with our DeProjNet to accurately reconstruct low-dose CT images. Experimental results demonstrate that our PSDP ob-tains the similar root mean square error (RMSE) as the existing paired-learning method, and remarkably de-creases RMSE by approximately 16% compared to the existing unpaired-learning method. In conclusion, our PSDP is a promising method and may have wide applications for reconstruction of low-dose CBCT.

Recently, a considerable amount of research leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn compact node embeddings, which are then used as input of the traditional clustering methods to get better clustering results. While in most of these methods the node representation learning and the clustering are performed separately, a few works have further coupled them in a self-supervised learning manner. The coupling, however, should be carefully designed to avoid potential noises in the pseudo labels generated automatically during the training process.To address the above problems, in this article, we propose Multi-level Label Graph Adaptive Learning (MLGAL), a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for the node clustering problem. We first design a graph filter to smooth the node features. Then, we iteratively choose the similar and the dissimilar node pairs to perform the adaptive learning with the multi-level label, i.e., the node-level label and the cluster-level label generated automatically by our model. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of our model. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on four benchmark datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques have been widely applied in depression research and treatment. Nevertheless, no specific predictor model for depression has been developed yet in Chile using specific Chilean characteristics (variables). The present study used data from 11525 participants of the National Health Survey (NHS) to create a model to predict risk of depression (PDRM). This model was contrasted with data from 280 outpatients diagnosed with depression. To develop the PDRM we employed classification algorithms models and fusion of data about depression from two waves of the NHS (2009-2010 and 2016-17). Validation of the model of 19 variables (questions) was done applying machine learning algorithms. Based on 2009-10 data, Recall for Naive Bayes (NB) yielded 0.92, LOGIT was 0.86 and SVM=0.84. After setting up the PDRM this predictor was contrasted with the data from patients (P) diagnosed Bipolar Disorder (140 P); Major Depressive Disorder (MDD, 140 P); and Adjustment Disorder (80 P, control). Fusion of patient's data from anamnesis and consultations was used to determine the presence or absence of each 16 variables per patient. Prediction of depression using the PDRM model detected 122 cases of depression out of the total 140 depressive cases, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8 and a recall 0.74 (with NB). This predictive model may contribute to decision-making processes in a fast, simple and economical way.

AB Since most metaheuristic algorithms for continuous search space have been developed, a number of transfer functions have been proposed including S-shaped, V-shaped, linear, U-shaped, and X-shaped to convert the continuous solution to the binary one. However, most existing transfer functions do not provide exploration and exploitation required to solve complex discrete problems. Thus, in this study, an improved binary GWO named extremum-based GWO (BE-GWO) algorithm is introduced. The proposed algorithm proposes a new cosine transfer function (CTF) to convert the continuous GWO to the binary form and then introduces an extremum (Ex) search strategy to improve the efficiency of converted binary solutions. The performance of the BE-GWO was evaluated through solving two binary optimization problems, the feature selection and the 0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). The results of feature selection problems were compared with several well-known binary metaheuristic algorithms such as BPSO, BGSA, BitABC, bALO, bGWO, BDA, BSSA, and BinABC. Moreover, the results were compared with four versions of the binary GWO, the binary PSO, and the binary ABC. In addition, the BE-GWO algorithm was evaluated to solve the 0-1 MKP with difficult and very difficult benchmark instances and the results were compared with several binary GWO variants. The results of two binary problems were statistically analyzed by the Friedman test. The experimental results showed that the proposed BE-GWO algorithm enhances the performance of binary GWO in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, exploration, and balancing between exploration and exploitation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE; DEVELOPER RECOMMENDATION; ATTACKS
AB As the complexity of cyberattacks continues to increase, multistage combination attacks have become the primary method of attack. Attackers plan and organize a series of attack steps, using various attack tools to achieve specific goals. Extracting knowledge about these tools is of great significance for both defense and tracing of attacks. We have noticed that there is a wealth of security tool-related knowledge within the open-source community, but research in this area is limited. It is challenging to achieve large-scale automated security tool information extraction. To address this, we propose automated knowledge graph construction architecture, named SecTKG, for open-source security tools. Our approach involves designing a security tool ontology model to describe tools, users, and relationships, which guides the extraction of security tool knowledge. In addition, we develop advanced entity recognition and classification methods, ensuring efficient and accurate knowledge extraction. As far as we know, this work is the first to construct the large-scale security tool knowledge graph, containing 4 million entities and 10 million relationships. Furthermore, we investigate the tendencies and particularities of security tools based on the SecTKG and developed a security tool influence-measuring application. The research fills a gap in the field of automated security tools' knowledge extraction and provides a foundation for future research and practical applications.

AB Hierarchical fuzzy systems have been an increasingly prevalent research topic, however, most of them are with fixed structures. This could reduce the flexibility of the method in applications and make it difficult to build an elastic multilayer structure for different input information. Hesitant fuzzy set (HFS) consists of rich and flexible hesitant fuzzy elements, which have been widely developed and applied in recent years, and related basic concepts and theories have been constantly developed and improved. By using the flexible expressing capabilities of HFS, we constructively construct a new serial-based hierarchical fuzzy system with flexible and adaptive rules in each layer, named after hesitant hierarchical T-S fuzzy system (HHFS). In the general HHFS, lengths of HFS elements play an important role generating constructions of each layer and consequent parameters of rules are adjusted by fuzzily weighted recursive least square method. It is the first time to build a multilayer fuzzy system using HFS. To adapt HHFS into the application of maneuvering target tracking, another newly adapted one, time-sequential hesitant fuzzy set (TSHFS) is utilized. The function of the conventional HFS is still generating structures of subsystems, and the TSHFS is utilized to optimize parameters of consequent parts with the new proposed approach for fluctuated hesitant information under TSHFS environment. In HHFS, the rules of subsystems are adaptively changeable according to different inputs, namely subsystems of each layer are with variant structures. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the effectiveness and advantage of HHFS are exhibited in various experiments.

AB Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP) that aims to extract triplets from comments. Each triplet comprises an aspect term, an opinion term, and the sentiment polarity of the aspect term. The neural network model developed for this task can enable robots to effectively identify and extract the most meaningful and relevant information from comment sentences, ultimately leading to better products and services for consumers. Most existing end-to-end models focus solely on learning the interactions between the three elements in a triplet and contextual words, ignoring the rich affective knowledge information contained in each word and paying insufficient attention to the relationships between multiple triplets in the same sentence. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel end-to-end model called the Dual Graph Convolutional Networks Integrating Affective Knowledge and Position Information (DGCNAP). This model jointly considers both the contextual features and the affective knowledge information by introducing the affective knowledge from SenticNet into the dependency graph construction of two parallel channels. In addition, a novel multi-target position-aware function is added to the graph convolutional network (GCN) to reduce the impact of noise information and capture the relationships between potential triplets in the same sentence by assigning greater positional weights to words that are in proximity to aspect or opinion terms. The experiment results on the ASTE-Data-V2 datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models significantly, where the F1 scores on 14res, 14lap, 15res, and 16res are 70.72, 57.57, 61.19, and 69.58.

DE Cross-modality person ReID; Two-stream network; Parameter sharing;
   Modality difference
AB Visible-infrared person re-identification aims to match pedestrian images between visible and infrared modalities, and its two main challenges are intra-modality differences and cross-modality differences between visible and infrared images. To address these issues, many advanced methods attempt to design new network structures to extract modality-sharing features, mitigate modality differences, or learn part-level features to overcome background interference. However, they ignore the parameter sharing of the convolutional layers to obtain more modality-sharing features. At the same time, only using part level features lack discriminative pedestrian representations such as body structure and contours. To handle these problems, a parameter sharing and feature learning network is proposed in this paper to mitigate modality differences and further enhance feature discrimination. Firstly, a new two-stream parameter sharing network is proposed, by sharing the convolutional layers parameters to obtain more modality-sharing features. Secondly, a multi-granularity feature learning module is designed to reduce modality differences at both coarse and fine-grained levels while further enhancing feature discriminability. In addition, a center alignment loss is proposed to learn relationships between identities and to reduce modality differences by clustering features into their centers. For the part-level feature learning, the hetero-center triplet loss is adopted to alleviate the strict constraints of triplet loss. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. In the SYSU-MM01 dataset, the Rank-1 and mAP reach 74.0% and 70.51% in the all-search mode, which is an increase of 3.4% and 3.61% to baseline, respectively.

AB Although the short-text retrieval model by BERT achieves significant performance improvement, research on the efficiency and performance of long-text retrieval still faces challenges. Therefore, this study proposes an efficient long-text retrieval model based on BERT (called LTR-BERT). This model achieves speed improvement while retaining most of the long-text retrieval performance. In particular, The LTR-BERT model is trained by using the relevance between short texts. Then, the long text is segmented and stored off-line. In the retrieval stage, only the coding of the query and the matching scores are calculated, which speeds up the retrieval. Moreover, a query expansion strategy is designed to enhance the representation of the original query and reserve the encoding region for the query. It is beneficial for learning missing information in the representation stage. The interaction mechanism without training parameters takes into account the local semantic details and the whole relevance to ensure the accuracy of retrieval and further shorten the response time. Experiments are carried out on MS MARCO Document Ranking dataset, which is specially designed for long-text retrieval. Compared with the interaction-focused semantic matching method by BERT-CLS, the MRR@10 values of the proposed LTR-BERT method are increased by 2.74%. Moreover, the number of documents processed per millisecond increased by 333 times.

AB With the continuous progress of contemporary science and technology and the increasing requirements for marine vehicles in various fields, the intelligence and automation of ships have become a general trend. The autonomous control of surface Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) generally covers the USV path planning, path tracking control, and autonomous collision avoidance control. But in the whole navigation process of USV, autonomous berthing is also a crucial part. And the research on the algorithm of the automatic berthing process of the USV is less. Mature USV autonomous berthing technology can effectively reduce the cost of human and material resources and financial resources while reducing the accident rate reasonably and safely. Therefore, it is of great importance to comprehensively promote the development of USV autonomous berthing technology.

AB Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019, people counting in confined spaces has become essential for controlling the flow of people and reducing viral spread. Many people-counting systems use a fisheye lens to achieve a wide viewing range. However, the images captured with a fisheye lens can have different sizes and deformations due to different camera heights, which consequently affects the accuracy of people counting. In this study, a Raspberry Pi 4 development board attached to a fisheye lens was used to construct an edge computing platform for people counting by using artificial intelligence. A modified You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, which has three output layers and a spatial pyramid pooling module, is proposed to recognize people in images captured at various heights. For efficiently running this deep learning model on the proposed edge computing platform, a TensorFlow Lite framework was used to reduce the model size. The final experimental results indicated that the mean average error and mean squared error of the modified tiny version of the YOLO v4 model were 0.249 and 0.292, respectively, and the detection speed of the platform was 2 frames per second. The results indicate that the proposed edge computing platform can efficiently and accurately count the number of people. Because the proposed system uses edge computing, it can effectively solve personal privacy and transmission bandwidth problems.

TI PSAQ-ViT V2: Toward Accurate and General Data-Free Quantization for

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Data-free quantization; model compression; patch similarity; quantized
   vision transformers (ViTs)
AB Data-free quantization can potentially address data privacy and security concerns in model compression and thus has been widely investigated. Recently, patch similarity aware data-free quantization for vision transformers (PSAQ-ViT) designs a relative value metric, patch similarity, to generate data from pretrained vision transformers (ViTs), achieving the first attempt at data-free quantization for ViTs. In this article, we propose PSAQ-ViT V2, a more accurate and general data-free quantization framework for ViTs, built on top of PSAQ-ViT. More specifically, following the patch similarity metric in PSAQ-ViT, we introduce an adaptive teacher-student strategy, which facilitates the constant cyclic evolution of the generated samples and the quantized model in a competitive and interactive fashion under the supervision of the full-precision (FP) model (teacher), thus significantly improving the accuracy of the quantized model. Moreover, without the auxiliary category guidance, we employ the task-and model-independent prior information, making the general-purpose scheme compatible with a broad range of vision tasks and models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various models on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, and PSAQ-ViT V2, with the naive quantization strategy and without access to real-world data, consistently achieves competitive results, showing potential as a powerful baseline on data-free quantization for ViTs. For instance, with Swin-S as the (backbone) model, 8-bit quantization reaches 82.13 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 50.9 box AP and 44.1 mask AP on COCO, and 47.2 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on ADE20K. We hope that accurate and general PSAQ-ViT V2 can serve as a potential and practice solution in real-world applications involving sensitive data.

AB In this article, an adaptive fixed-time tracking control scheme is investigated for stochastic nonlinear systems with asymmetric time-varying state constraints based on the dynamic event-triggered control (DETC) mechanism. First, a unified barrier function is employed to constrain the states into asymmetric time-varying functions directly. Then, through fuzzy logic systems (FLS) and DETC strategy, the issues of unknown nonlinear functions and computation burden are solved. Meanwhile, with the aid of backstepping technology and Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all state variables are successfully within the asymmetric time-varying functions and all signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded in a fixed time. In the final, two simulation experiments illustrate the feasibility and suitability of the controller.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Unsupervised person re-identification; Multi-branch transformer; Hybrid
   contrastive learning; Outlier re-assignment
AB Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of generating pseudo-labels by measuring feature similarity in unsupervised person re-identification (ReID). However, most of these methods ignore the distribution discrepancy among cameras, which leads to degraded accuracy in generated pseudo-labels. Besides, limited by the small receptive field and downsampling operations, the convolution-based schemes cannot effectively capture fine-grained information and global dependencies. In this paper, we propose multiformer-based hybrid learning with outlier re-assignment (MHOR) for unsupervised person ReID. Firstly, to mitigate the distribution discrepancy among cameras, we design a multi-branch transformer (Multiformer) network, including inter-camera transformer (Interformer) and intra-camera transformer (Intraformer). The Multiformer network allows the computation of feature similarity to be performed separately for inter-camera and intra-camera scenarios. Secondly, to further enhance the fine-grained information and global dependencies feature representation in the context of Multiformer, a dynamic outlier re-assignment (DORA) strategy is proposed to reassign pseudo-labels by computing the affinity matrix of outlier samples with cluster centers. Thirdly, to improve the quality of pseudo-labels, we propose hybrid contrastive learning (HCL), which uses instance-level contrastive learning to distinguish different pedestrian features and introduces cluster-level contrastive learning to alleviate the unreliability problem caused by noisy labels. Finally, extensive experiments show that MHOR can significantly surpass the performance of previous works on unsupervised tasks for person ReID.

AB Background. Handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) is a difficult prob-lem in character recognition. Chinese characters are diverse and many of them are very similar. The HCCR model consumes a large number of computational resources during runtime, making it difficult to deploy to resource-limited development platforms.Methods. In order to reduce the computational consumption and improve the operational efficiency of such models, an improved lightweight HCCR model is proposed in this article. We reconstructed the basic modules of the SqueezeNext network so that the model would be compatible with the introduced attention module and model compression techniques. The proposed Cross-stage Convolutional Block Attention Module (C-CBAM) redeploys the Spatial Attention Module (SAM) and the Channel Attention Module (CAM) according to the feature map characteristics of the deep and shallow layers of the model, targeting enhanced information interaction between the deep and shallow layers. The reformulated intra-stage convolutional kernel importance assessment criterion integrates the normalization nature of the weights and allows for structured pruning in equal proportions for each stage of the model. The quantization aware training is able to map the 32-bit floating-point weights in the pruned model to 8-bit fixed-point weights with minor loss.Results. Pruning with the new convolutional kernel importance evaluation criterion proposed in this article can achieve a pruning rate of 50.79% with little impact on the accuracy rate. The various optimization methods can compress the model to 1.06 MB and achieve an accuracy of 97.36% on the CASIA-HWDB dataset. Compared with the initial model, the volume is reduced by 87.15%, and the accuracy is improved by 1.71%. The model proposed in this article greatly reduces the running time and storage requirements of the model while maintaining accuracy.

AB Modern cutting-edge technologies have changed the appearance of the world and are presently working diligently to turn this partially automated world into a fully autonomous one. The primary players in this quest are the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and artificial intelligence. These technologies are game changers in almost all walks of life, including business, entertainment, healthcare, agriculture, education, etc. In the education sector, these technologies play their role to some extent, but there is still some room that needs to be filled in order to utilize the full potential of these technologies. For instance, there is very limited work in the literature that utilizes these technologies for developing college students' innovative and entrepreneurial skills. Thus, the main goal of this research is to investigate how big data analysis and IoT might be used by the professional associations of college students to encourage their growth of innovative and entrepreneurial skills. In this study, we tackled this issue in two ways: first, we thoroughly examined how IoT can help college students' professional associations for developing their innovative and entrepreneurial skills. More specifically, we used IoT to collect data on innovative and entrepreneurial skills from associations of college students. Secondly, we used a big data analytic algorithm, i.e., C4.5 decision tree, to calculate the knowledge acquisition rate for the professional associations of students' training in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation. The results are carefully evaluated, and a thorough comparison is made with relevant work from the literature. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method has a high degree of data classification accuracy and a high data throughput capacity as compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed IoT and big data-enabled approach can significantly enhance college students' professional practice and employment capabilities.

AB With the advent of science and technology, sports activities have advanced at an unprecedented scale in recent years. The rising complexity of advanced technologies has substantial ramifications for the sports industry. Therefore, table tennis coaches can gain useful training and strategic insights by studying technical and tactical data. Thus, the major goal of this research work is to explore the autonomous use of data mining techniques in the evaluation of table tennis strategies and tactics. The primary goal of this study is to undertake in-depth research on a data-mining-based table tennis technical and tactical analysis system. The objective is to give coaches with exact insights into technical and tactical data related to table tennis by enabling them to make informed decisions and provide efficient background information. This paper first designs the overall architecture of the technical and tactical analysis system for table tennis by providing a thorough overview of its functional structure. This functional structure consists of three modules: data acquisition, statistical analysis, and technical and tactical information management. The database of the system is then explained, with a focus on the technical and action table types. Third, this study builds the suggested table tennis system utilizing MySQL database to mark each game in accordance with indications for technical and tactical analysis. The constructed system stores each point's information and template information according to each game's information. To enhance the security of data storage, the constructed system improves the efficiency of the overall data collection and query system by realizing targeted query and statistical data according to different technical and tactical indicators. In addition, this paper uses multicondition screening and multi-condition sorting to process the technical and tactical information. Finally, this paper analyzes the table tennis approaches and tactics using a data mining technique. This is accomplished by combining sequential and inverse correlation analysis modes to produce an analysis system for table tennis tactics. The experimental findings show that the system performs commendably overall, with excellent data mining accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency of the suggested system is verified by the fact that it successfully improves training levels and competitive quality of athletes in table tennis.

AB Acceptance sampling plans (ASPs) are conducted by inspecting a small set of items instead of all outputs. Although traditional ASPs use certain plan parameters, it is clear that quality characteristics or definitions may not be certain in some real case applications because of uncertainties. The fuzzy set theory (FST) is a popular technique to model uncertainty in the engineering problems. It is known that ASPs have been successfully formulated based on FST in the literature. However, the uncertainty is generally more complex in cases including human evaluations. Neutrosophic sets (NSs) that is one of the fuzzy set extensions bring some advantages to manage more complicated uncertainties in quality problems especially uncertainty based on human's hesitancy. Since the NSs include three terms as truthiness (t), indeterminacy (i), and falsity (f), they can successfully model the human thinking and inspectors' evaluations under uncertainty. In this paper, traditional attribute ASPs have been extended based on interval NSs to combine the computational and interpretational advantages of the interval statistics with the advantages of NSs. Additionally, two well-known distributions for ASPs called Binomial and Poisson distributions are redesigned by using NSs. For this aim, NSs are converted to interval NSs by using a-cut technique and some characteristic functions of ASPs such as acceptance probability (P-a), average sample number (ASN), and average total inspection (ATI) have been designed for single and double ASPs based on interval NSs. The proposed ASPs based on NSs have been tested on some numerical applications from a manufacturing process, and results obtained based on real cases have been compared.

AB Maintenance strategy selection is an important step in maintenance management, which is the basis for implementing maintenance optimization and formulating specific maintenance schemes. This paper takes the meta-action unit (MU) as the research object, considers the randomness and fuzziness of expert evaluation and the interaction between evaluation criteria in the selection process of maintenance strategy, and proposes a maintenance strategy selection method based on cloud DEMATEL-ANP. Firstly, DEMATEL based on cloud model is used to establish the interaction model between the main criteria, determine the weighted cloud weight of the super matrix and the inner dependencies of the sub-criteria under the same main criteria. Then, the cloud-ANP model is used to determine the outer dependencies relationship and construct the cloud super matrix, so as to obtain the cloud weight of each evaluation criteria in maintenance strategy selection. By using the subjective and objective weighting method, the evaluation of different experts on different maintenance strategy criteria is integrated, and the priority of alternative maintenance strategies of MU is obtained. Finally, different methods are used to sort and compare the alternative maintenance strategies of the rotating body rotation MU of the CNC turntable, which verifies the scientificity and effectiveness of the maintenance strategy selection method based on cloud DEMATEL-ANP are verified.

AB This paper considers the problem of how to construct the optimal multi-period portfolio for investors with loss aversion in fuzzy environment. Firstly, we regard the return rates of the risky assets as fuzzy numbers and use the value function in prospect theory to transform the return rate of a portfolio into perceived value, which can reflect investors' loss aversion. Moreover, due to the fact that investors' perception level toward risk may vary with the loss aversion degree, we propose a new risk measure based on the perceived value. Then, we formulate the objectives of maximizing the cumulative expected perceived value and minimizing the cumulative perceived risk and propose a multi-period portfolio selection model with diversification constraint. Furthermore, to solve the proposed model, we design a multiple particle swarm optimization algorithm with respect to its specific situation. Finally, using the data from real financial market, we construct a real case to illustrate the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The results show that loss aversion has an important effect on investors' investment decisions, and the proposed model could provide more reasonable strategies for investors with different loss aversion degrees.

AB With the continuous progress of computer and network technology, teaching methods and educational models are also constantly evolving and improving. The development of facial recognition technology has brought new opportunities and challenges to the development of educational theory and systems. This article establishes a remote music teaching system based on facial recognition and deep learning technology. The system adopts the Java EE framework structure and deep learning technology. By conducting deep learning and training on a large amount of facial data, we can identify students' facial expressions and emotional states, thereby better understanding their learning status and needs. At the same time, the system also supports multiple teaching modes and interactive methods, providing teachers and students with a more convenient and efficient teaching management and learning experience. Subsequently, this article evaluated and explored the effectiveness of the remote music teaching system through a questionnaire survey. The results show that most students believe that the system can help them better master basic music knowledge and professional skills, improve learning effectiveness and achieve learning goals. The use of the system can also stimulate students' interest in music learning, providing new ways and means for teaching.

AB Vehicle routing (VRP) and traveling salesman problems (TSP) are classical and interesting NP-hard routing combinatorial optimization (CO) with practical significance. While moving forward with artificial intelligence, researchers are paying more and more attention to applying machine learning to classical CO problems. However, traditional reinforcement learning faces challenges like reward sparsity and unstable training, so it is necessary to assist agents in finding high-quality routings in the initial model training stage to obtain more positive feedback. This paper proposes a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based two-stage multi-agent reinforcement learning training pipeline (MCRL) in which we also design a multifunctional reward function, improving efficiency, accuracy, and diversity to guide agents to learn the routings over graphs better. Besides, previous approaches are frequently too sluggish in runtime to be useful in contexts with sparsely connected networks and uncertain traffic. As an alternative, we design a model based on graph neural networks that can execute multi-agent routing in a sparsely connected graph with constantly changing traffic circumstances. Also, the agents are better equipped to collaborate online and adjust to changes thanks to our learned communication module.

AB Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography or OCTA represents one of the main means of diagnosis of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. This eye disease is characterized by Macular Neovascularization (MNV), the formation of vessels that tear through the retinal tissues. Four types of MNV can be distinguished, each representing different levels of severity. Both the aggressiveness of the treatment and the recovery of the patient rely on an early detection and correct diagnosis of the stage of the disease. In this work, we propose the first fully-automatic grading methodology that considers all the four clinical types of MNV at the three most relevant OCTA scanning depths for the diagnosis of AMD. We perform both a comprehensive ablation study on the contribution of said depths and an analysis of the attention maps of the network in collaboration with experts of the domain. Our proposal aims to ease the diagnosis burden and decrease the influence of subjectivity on it, offering a explainable grading through the visualization of the attention of the expert models. Our grading proposal achieved satisfactory results with an AUC of 0.9224 & PLUSMN; 0.0381. Additionally, the qualitative analysis performed in collaboration with experts revealed the relevance of the avascular plexus in the grading of all three types of MNV (despite not being directly involved in some of them). Thus, our proposal is not only able to robustly detect MNV in complex scenarios, but also aided to discover previously unconsidered relationships between plexuses.

DE Multi-task optimization; Non-revisiting scheme; CUDA platform
AB Multi-task optimization is an emerging research topic in evolutionary computation, which aims to solve multiple optimization tasks simultaneously through knowledge transfer. However, existing multi-task evolutionary algorithms suffer from the re-evaluation problem, leading to unnecessary consumption of computing resources. To address this issue, a non-revisiting framework is proposed, which allows the non-revisiting scheme to be aided by historical information during the evolutionary search process. Moreover, an individual updating strategy is designed to improve the search efficiency of the algorithm and enhance the ability to escape local optima. Furthermore, a parallel scheme of the proposed framework is developedNational Frontiers Science Center for Industrial Intelligence and Systems Optimizationcomputation time on the CUDA architecture. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, it is integrated with success-history based adaptive differential evolution. A comparative study of the proposed algorithm with eight state-of-the-art multi-task evolutionary algorithms is performed on nine benchmark problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms, highlighting its potential for solving multi-task optimization problems.

AB In actual decision-making problems, it is very difficult to appropriately depict the cognitive information of the relevant experts because cognition is usually diverse and contains uncertainties and fuzziness. The recently introduced linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (Lq-ROFS), which determines the linguistic preferred degree and linguistic nonpreferred degree within a wider space, has been shown to be effective in representing cognitive information. However, the corresponding preference relation has yet to be studied. Pairwise comparison is an effective way for decision-makers to express their preferences, especially when cognition is complex and indeterminate. Therefore, this paper employs linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy preference relations (Lq-ROFPRs) to express the cognitive information of experts. The additive consistency of Lq-ROFPR is introduced to rank the objects, and a consistency-based model is built to obtain the normalized linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy priority weight vector (Lq-ROFPWV). Then, several models are constructed to estimate missing values and improve the additive consistency level. For the group decision-making (GDM) problem, a model is first built with which to gain the weights of decision-makers. When group consensus is not achieved, a consensus-reaching model is designed as a means of increasing the consensus level. This study designs a decision support model to address GDM problem with incomplete Lq-ROFPRs and presents a step-by-step algorithm. The proposed method is utilized to assess four Chinese shopping platforms, and the comprehensive ranking result is reasonable and reliable. This is the first time to investigate GDM with Lq-ROFPRs based on consistency and consensus analysis, the newly studied Lq-ROFPRs not only extend the applications for linguistic preference relations but also endow experts with more flexibility in denoting their cognitive preferences. Compared to the latest published work in this domain, the novel approach conducts a reasonable decision-making process and has some advantages.

AB The aim of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is to utilize knowledge from a source domain to enhance the performance of a given target domain. Due to the lack of accessibility to the target domain's labels, UDA's efficacy is highly reliant on the source domain's quality. However, it is often impractical and expensive to obtain an appropriate transferable source domain. To address this issue, we propose a novel UDA setting, source domain reconstruction (SDR), which seeks to construct a new transferable source domain utilizing labeled source samples and unlabeled target samples. SDR has a significant advantage over the conventional method as it is much less expensive to construct a suitable pseudo-source domain rather than collecting an actual transferable source domain in real-world scenarios. To test the practice of SDR, we investigate SDR theoretically. We propose an easily implementable algorithm, the domain MixUp (DMU), which is motivated by the MixUp strategy, to solve the SDR problem. The algorithm can be used to design a UDA framework to significantly enhance the performance of several existing UDA algorithms. Results from extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmarks $(66$ UDA tasks) indicate that the reconstructed source domain has stronger transferability than the original source domain.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) has seen several breakthroughs in some perfect- and imperfect-information games, such as Go, Texas Hold'em, and StarCraft II. However, the Chinese poker game, DouDiZhu presents new challenges for AI systems to overcome, including infering imperfect information, training with sparse rewards, and handling a large state-action space. This article describes our proposed DouDiZhu AI system, RARSMSDou, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms that combines Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Relative Advantage Reward Shaping with Minimum Splits (RARSMS), and Deep Monte-Carlo (DMC) into a self-play framework. In RARSMSDou, we propose RARSMS as a novel intrinsic reward to guide the training for PPO in a sparse reward environment. We treat the imperfect information as observable information and feed it into the critic-network of PPO, and we propose abstract actions to simplify the large-action space (27,472 actions) to a low-dimensional action space (309 actions contain 189 specific actions and 120 abstract actions) which is output by the policy network of PPO. When the policy is an abstract action, DMC (DouZeroX) maps this abstract action to its specific action as a policy for training or execution. We compare the performance of RARSMSDou with its four variants (PPO, PPO+RARSMS, PPO+DMC, DMC (DouZeroX)) and five state-of-the-art DouDiZhu AI programs. The experiment results show that after 30 days of self-play and training, RARSMSDou outperforms its variants and DouZero (with a WP of 0.582 and an ADP of 0.414), which is the best DouDiZhu baseline.

TI Adversarial Coreset Selection for Efficient Robust Training

DT Article
DE Adversarial training; Coreset selection; Efficient training; Robust deep
   learning; Image classification
AB It has been shown that neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding well-crafted, imperceptible perturbations to their input can modify their output. Adversarial training is one of the most effective approaches to training robust models against such attacks. Unfortunately, this method is much slower than vanilla training of neural networks since it needs to construct adversarial examples for the entire training data at every iteration. By leveraging the theory of coreset selection, we show how selecting a small subset of training data provides a principled approach to reducing the time complexity of robust training. To this end, we first provide convergence guarantees for adversarial coreset selection. In particular, we show that the convergence bound is directly related to how well our coresets can approximate the gradient computed over the entire training data. Motivated by our theoretical analysis, we propose using this gradient approximation error as our adversarial coreset selection objective to reduce the training set size effectively. Once built, we run adversarial training over this subset of the training data. Unlike existing methods, our approach can be adapted to a wide variety of training objectives, including TRADES, l(p )PGD, and Perceptual Adversarial Training. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach speeds up adversarial training by 2-3 times while experiencing a slight degradation in the clean and robust accuracy.

AB Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an effortless task for humans, and such non-verbal communication is intricately related to how we relate to others beyond the explicit content of our speech. Facial expressions can convey how we are feeling, as well as our intentions, and are thus a key point in multimodal social interactions. Recent computational advances, such as promising results from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have drawn increasing attention to the potential of FER to enhance human-agent interaction (HAI) and human-robot interaction (HRI), but questions remain as to how "transferrable" the learned knowledge is from one task environment to another. In this paper, we explore how FER can be deployed in HAI cooperative game paradigms, where a human subject interacts with a virtual avatar in a goal-oriented environment where they must cooperate to survive. The primary question was whether transfer learning (TL) would offer an advantage for FER over pre-trained models based on similar (but the not exact same) task environment. The final results showed that TL was able to achieve significantly improved results (94.3% accuracy), without the need for an extensive task-specific corpus. We discuss how such approaches could be used to flexibly create more life-like robots and avatars, capable of fluid social interactions within cooperative multimodal environments.

SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSCAPE
AB A challenging problem in deep learning consists in developing theoretical frameworks suitable to study generalization. Feng and colleagues uncover a duality relation between neuron activities and weights in deep learning neural networks, and use it to show that sharpness of the loss landscape and norm of the solution act together in determining its generalization performance.
   Generalization is a fundamental problem in machine learning. For overparameterized deep neural network models, there are many solutions that can fit the training data equally well. The key question is which solution has a better generalization performance measured by test loss (error). Here we report the discovery of exact duality relations between changes in activities and changes in weights in any fully connected layer in feed-forward neural networks. By using the activity-weight duality relation, we decompose the generalization loss into contributions from different directions in weight space. Our analysis reveals that two key factors, sharpness of the loss landscape and size of the solution, act together to determine generalization. In general, flatter and smaller solutions have better generalization. By using the generalization loss decomposition, we show how existing learning algorithms and regularization schemes affect generalization by controlling one or both factors. Furthermore, by applying our analysis framework to evaluate different algorithms for realistic large neural network models in the multi-learner setting, we find that the decentralized algorithms have better generalization performance as they introduce additional landscape-dependent noise that leads to flatter solutions without changing their sizes.

AB The environments in living cells are highly heterogeneous and compartmentalized, posing a grand challenge for the deployment of theranostic agents with spatiotemporal precision. Despite rapid advancements in creating nanodevices responsive to various cues in cellular environments, it remains difficult to control their operations based on the temporal sequence of these cues. Here, inspired by the temporally resolved process of viral invasion in nature, we design a DNA framework state machine (DFSM) that can target specific chromatin loci in living cells in a temporally controllable manner. The DFSM is composed of a six-helix DNA framework with multiple locks that can be opened via DNA strand displacement. The opening of locks at different locations results in distinct structural configurations of the DFSM. We show that the DFSM can switch among up to six structural states with reversibility, in response to the temporally ordered molecular inputs, including DNA keys, adenosine triphosphate or nucleolin. By implementing state switching of the DFSM in living cells, we demonstrate temporally controlled CRISPR-Cas9 targeting towards specific chromatin loci, which sheds light on biocomputing and smart theranostics in complex biological environments.
   The heterogeneous and compartmentalized environments within living cells make it difficult to deploy theranostic agents with precise spatiotemporal accuracy. Zhao et al. demonstrate a DNA framework state machine that can switch among multiple structural states according to the temporal sequence of molecular cues, enabling temporally controlled CRISPR-Cas9 targeting in living mammalian cells.

TI GrapHiSM: a graph-based hierarchical semantics-driven model for aerial
   scene classification under scarcity of labelled samples

DE Scene classification; Graph representation learning; Spatial semantics;
   Aerial image; Labelled sample scarcity
AB Aerial scene classification can be treated as the problem of acquiring high-level semantic interpretations of the earth-surface images, remotely captured from the space or from the aerial vehicles. Although the topic is already extensively explored thus far, due to the high complexities and diversities in geometrical and spatial texture of aerial scenes, there still remain several open challenges. This paper primarily focuses on a comparatively new challenge of aerial scene classification under labelled sample scarcity, which restricts the promising deep network models, such as convolutional neural networks, to attain the desired accuracy. Even the graph convolutional networks, which have added strength of capturing spatial relationships, fail to perform well when trained with limited training samples. We address this issue by generating hierarchical semantics-driven multiple graph representations for each image, and subsequently, employing graph representation learning over these multitude of graphs which act as augmented training samples. Our graph-based hierarchical semantics-driven model (GrapHiSM) is evaluated using benchmark UC-Merced and AID datasets. Experimental results exhibit efficacy of GrapHiSM, in handling labelled sample scarcity at the time of aerial scene classification.

AB Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are efficient computational intelligence (CI) techniques for solving complex optimization problems in different areas. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has recently emerged as a popular research topic as people are increasingly attempting to know the manner in which AI algorithms attain results. In this context, understanding and analyzing the optimization processes of EAs to effectively enhance their performance are crucial and challenging tasks. Most traditional visualization methods focus on dimensionality reduction, visualization of the fitness landscape and the optimization process for a particular algorithm. This study represents the first attempt at establishing a comprehensive dynamic visualization tool, Evo-Panel, that can directly and flexibly illustrate the detailed procedures of different optimization algorithms in solving numerical benchmark functions. The objective is to help users identify the influence of the design formulas, operations, and parameters on the capabilities and performances of the algorithms. Using Evo-Panel, users can trace each movement, observe the process in an intuitive manner, and interpret the processes related to EAs, which are important to XAI. Moreover, Evo-Panel can be used to perform a comparative analysis to illustrate the differences between algorithms. Results of case studies demonstrate that the use of Evo-Panel can allow professors to explain optimization algorithms in a visually interesting manner and facilitate the students' understanding of EAs. The tool can promote CI-related education from teaching and learning perspectives. Furthermore, researchers can use it to obtain information for analysis, facilitate debugging, verify design ideas, gain insights into the process, and enhance the design of EAs.

ID BRAIN; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS
AB Motor imagery Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been widely used in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) due to their advantage of non-invasiveness and easy acquisition. However, due to distortions in the temporal and local information of the EEG signal and inter-subject variability, it is very time-consuming to perform a calibration procedure designed in a subject-specific manner, which requires a large number of labeled samples. To this end, we construct EEG brain graph based on EEG electrode distribution and propose a new subdomain adversarial network for learning domain-invariant features to achieve cross-domain classification of motor imagery EEG signals. Specifically, the proposed method constructs a brain graph based on the spatial distribution of electrodes and their functional connections, and builds EEG graph data. The subdomain adversarial network aligns data distributions under the same class domain and improves the classification performance of the target domain using source domain labeled samples. We have conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we have done ablation study and visualization analysis to explain the contribution of each component to cross-domain classification.

AB The fundus image is often used in clinical diagnosis due to ease and safety of acquisition, but the quality may be affected by environment and onsite operations. As low-quality medical images may lead to misinterpretation in diagnosis and analysis, it is important to improve quality of the improperly acquired fundus images. Unfortunately, the existing fundus image enhancement methods require task-specific prior knowledge or suffer from insufficient generalization ability. To cope with this issue, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based model is proposed, namely the semi-supervised GAN with anatomical structure preservation (SSGAN-ASP). Specifically, an anatomical structure extraction component is employed in the generator to guide the enhancement process by preserving both retinal and lesion structures, while color information in the fundus image is also preserved. The SSGAN-ASP model is evaluated and compared with the state-of-the-art methods for medical image enhancement on three popular datasets. In addition, it is applied in the pre-processing of retinal vessel segmentation and diabetic retinopathy grading tasks to show efficacy in computer-aided diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that visual quality of the enhanced image can be improved while better performance in clinical diagnosis is achieved with our proposed model by adopting the anatomical structure extraction component and preserving color information as well.

DE Information symmetry; interaction modeling; news recommendation
ID USER
AB Accurate matching between user and candidate news plays a fundamental role in news recommendation. Most existing studies capture fine-grained user interests through effective user modeling. Nevertheless, user interest representations are often extracted from multiple history news items, while candidate news representations are learned from specific news items. The asymmetry of information density causes invalid matching of user interests and candidate news, which severely affects the click-through rate prediction for specific candidate news. To resolve the problems mentioned above, we propose a symmetrical information interaction modeling for news recommendation (SIIR) in this article. We first design a light interactive attention network for user (LIAU) modeling to extract user interests related to the candidate news and reduce interference of noise effectively. LIAU overcomes the shortcomings of complex structure and high training costs of conventional interaction-based models and makes full use of domain-specific interest tendencies of users. We then propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) to enhance candidate news representation through the potential relations among news. HGNN builds a candidate news enhancement scheme without user interaction to further facilitate accurate matching with user interests, which mitigates the cold-start problem effectively. Experiments on two realistic news datasets, i.e., MIND and Adressa, demonstrate that SIIR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-model methods by a large margin.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Data augmentation; hyperspectral image (HSI) classification; multimodal
   remote sensing; multistage information complementary fusion
AB Mixup-based data augmentation has been proven to be beneficial to the regularization of models during training, especially in the remote-sensing field where the training data is scarce. However, in the process of data augmentation, the Mixup-based methods ignore the target proportion in different inputs and keep the linear insertion ratio consistent, which leads to the response of label space even if no effective objects are introduced in the mixed image due to the randomness of the augmentation process. Moreover, although some previous works have attempted to utilize different multimodal interaction strategies, they could not be well extended to various remote-sensing data combinations. To this end, a multistage information complementary fusion network based on flexible-mixup (Flex-MCFNet) is proposed for hyperspectral-X image classification. First, to bridge the gap between the mixed image and the label, a flexible-mixup (FlexMix) data augmentation strategy is designed, where the weight of the label increases with the ratio of the input image to prevent the negative impact on the label space because of the introduction of invalid information. More importantly, to summarize diverse remote-sensing data inputs including various modal supplements and uncertainties, a multistage information complementary fusion network (MCFNet) is developed. After extracting the features of hyperspectral and complementary modalities X-modal, including multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) separately, the information between complementary modalities is fully interacted and enhanced through multiple stages of information complement and fusion, which is used for the final image classification. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that Flex-MCFNet can not only effectively expand the training data, but also adequately regularize different data combinations to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

AB Comments are summary descriptions of code snippets. When analyzing and maintaining programs, developers tend to read tidy comments rather than lengthy code. To prevent developers from misunderstanding the program or leading to potential bugs, ensuring the consistency and co-evolution of comments and the corresponding code is an integral development activity in practice. Nevertheless, when modifying code, developers sometimes neglect to update the relevant comments, resulting in inconsistency. Such comments may pose threats to the comprehension and maintenance of the software. In our study, we propose an overall approach named Context and Refactor based Comment Updater (CRCU). CRCU is a Just-In-Time (JIT) comment updater for specific commits. It takes a commit-id as input and updates all the method comments in this commit according to the code change. CRCU could be viewed as an optimization and augmentation of existing comment updaters, especially those that rely only on neural networks. Compared to the existing comment updaters, CRCU fully leverages the programming context and refactoring types of the modified methods to improve its performance. In addition, several customized enhancements in data pre-processing are introduced in CRCU to handle and filter out low-quality commits. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of CRCU. The evaluation results show that CRCU combined with the state-of-the-art approaches could improve the average Accuracy by 6.87% and reduce the developers' edits by 0.298 on average.

AB In this paper, we develop two SVM-based classifiers named stable nested one-class support vector machines (SN-1SVMs) and decoupled margin-moment based SVMs (DMMB-SVMs), to predict the specific type of pancreatic carcinoma using quantitative histopathological sig -natures of images. For each patient, the diagnosis can produce hundreds of images, which can be used to classify the pancreatic tissues into three classes: chronic pancreatitis, intraduc-tal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and pancreatic carcinoma. The proposed two approaches tackle the classification problems from two different perspectives: the SN-1SVM treats each image as a classification point in a nested fashion to predict malignancy of the tissues, while the DMMB-SVM treats each patient as a classification point by assembling information across images. One attractive feature of the DMMB-SVM is that, in addition to utilizing the mean information, it also takes into account the covariance of features extracted from images for each patient. We conduct numerical experiments to evaluate and compare performance of the two methods. It is observed that the SN-1SVM can take advantage of the data struc-ture more effectively, while the DMMB-SVM demonstrates better computational efficiency and classification accuracy. To further improve interpretability of the final classifier, we also consider the l(1)-norm in the DMMB-SVM to handle feature selection.

AB The n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy set theory has appeared as a fresh mathematical tool for dealing with uncertainty in several fields of the real world. The n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy sets were introduced to make uncertain data from broadly applicable real-world decision-making scenarios tractable analytically. In this regard, n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy sets outperform intuitionistic, Pythagorean, Fermatean, and q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets in terms of flexibility and dependability. Bipolar fuzzy sets are useful tools for handling fuzziness and bipolarity. The bipolar n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy set (Bn,m-ROFS) model is presented in this study as a generic extension of two powerful existing models, namely the bipolar intuitionistic fuzzy set and the bipolar Pythagorean fuzzy set models. This suggested set completely reflects both quantitative and qualitative evaluations and fully exploits the n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy set. Moreover, subset, equal, complement, intersection, and union are some key characteristics of the proposed Bn,m-ROFS model that are examined along with numerical examples. Additionally, certain fundamental operations are established here, including the bipolar n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted average operator and the bipolar n,m-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric operator. Furthermore, a Bn,m-ROFS application is investigated to handle various multiattribute decision-making situations, such as the choice of the best manager. The suggested methodology is backed up by an algorithm. Finally, the comparison of the indicated hybrid model with a known model, such as the bipolar Pythagorean fuzzy set, is offered.

AB Face image manipulation detection (FIMD) is a research area of great interest, widely applicable in fields requiring data security and authentication. Existing FIMD schemes aim to identify manipulations in digital face images, but they possess individual strengths and limitations. Most schemes can only detect specific manipulations under certain conditions, leading to variable success rates across different images. The literature lacks emphasis on detecting manipulations involving multiple faces. This paper introduces a novel blind tamper detection and localization scheme specifically designed for multiple faces in digital images. The proposed multiple faces manipulation detection (MFMD) scheme consists of two stages: face detection and selection, and image watermarking. Through extensive experiments, the MFMD scheme's performance has been evaluated on various multiple-face images, considering embedding capacity, payload, watermarked image quality, time complexity, and manipulation detection ability. The results demonstrate the MFMD scheme's efficacy in detecting different types of manipulations for multiple faces in images. Furthermore, the watermarked images exhibit high visual quality, even when multiple faces are present. The scheme's efficiency recommends it for practical applications, especially in sharing personal images over unsecured networks. This research advances FIMD techniques by addressing the neglected area of multiple-face manipulation detection. With improved accuracy, faster processing times, and resilience against various manipulations, the MFMD scheme offers valuable capabilities for enhancing data security and authentication in real-world scenarios.

   Self-attention; Triplet loss; Occluded person re-identification
AB Occluded person re-identification (Re-ID) task has been a long-standing challenge since occlusions inevitably lead to the deficiency of pedestrian information. Most existing methods tackle the challenge by employing auxiliary models, including pose estimation or graph matching models, to learn multi-scale or part-level features. However, the methods heavily rely on the external cues, the performance degrades when the target pedestrian is occluded severely or occluded by another pedestrian. This paper develops a novel Re-ID model single-scale robust feature representation (SRFR) to learn discriminative single-scale features without external cues. Specifically, a light-weight spatial memory module is investigated which takes the advantages of key-value memory network to store occlusion features and utilizes self-attention architecture to get fine-grained features. Furthermore, a camera-constrained triplet loss (CTL) function is exploited to mitigate the negative effects of different pedestrian samples under the same camera on the basis of the triplet loss. Experimental results show the SRFR achieves superior performance on both occluded and holistic datasets, which prove that single-scale features can also work well on mining discriminative features.

DT Article
DE Reinforcement learning; Actor-critic; GMM; Exploration
AB While reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have generated impressive strategies for a wide range of tasks, the performance improvements in continuous-domain, real-world problems do not follow the same trend. Poor exploration and quick convergence to locally optimal solutions play a dominant role. Advanced RL algorithms attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing exploration signals during the training procedure. This successful integration has paved the way to introduce signals from the intrinsic exploration branch. ACRE algorithm is a framework that concretely describes the conditions for such an integration, avoiding transforming the Markov decision process into time varying, and as a result, making the whole optimization scheme brittle and susceptible to instability. The key distinction of ACRE lies in the way of handling and storing both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards. ACRE is an off-policy, actor-critic style RL algorithm that separately approximates the forward novelty return. ACRE is shipped with a Gaussian mixture model to calculate the instantaneous novelty; however, different options could also be integrated. Using such an effective early exploration, ACRE results in substantial improvements over alternative RL methods, in a range of continuous control RL environments, such as learning from policy-misleading reward signals. Open-source implementation is available here: .

AB Solving matrix equation with noise interference is a challenging problem in mathematical and engineering applications. Unlike the traditional recurrent neural network, a novel varying-parameter periodic rhythm neural network (VP-PRNN) is proposed and used to solve the time-varying matrix equation in finite energy noise environment online. Particularly, VP-PRNN can enable the state solution to converge to the theoretical solution rapidly and robustly, which is also proved by theoretical analysis. Four kinds of noise are used to test the system, which proves the effectiveness of VP-PRNN. Compared with the zeroing neural network and circadian rhythms learning network with fixed parameters, VP-PRNN with variable parameters shows superior convergence performance in the disturbance of finite energy noise.

AB The photoelectric factor (PEF) is an important well-logging tool to distinguish between different types of reservoir rocks because PEF measurement is sensitive to elements with high atomic numbers. Furthermore, the ratio of rock minerals could be determined by combining PEF log with other well logs. However, PEF logs could be missing in some cases such as in old well logs and wells drilled with barite-based mud. Therefore, developing models for estimating missing PEF logs is essential in those circumstances. In this work, we developed various machine learning models to predict PEF values using the following well logs as inputs: bulk density (RHOB), neutron porosity (NPHI), gamma ray (GR), compressional and shear velocity. The predictions of PEF values using adaptive-network-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN) models have errors of about 16% and 14% average absolute percentage error (AAPE) in the testing dataset, respectively. Thus, a different approach was proposed that is based on the concept of automated machine learning. It works by automatically searching for the optimal model type and optimizes its hyperparameters for the dataset under investigation. This approach selected a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model for the accurate estimation of PEF values. The developed GPR model decreases the AAPE of the predicted PEF values in the testing dataset to about 10% AAPE. This error could be further decreased to about 2% by modeling the potential noise in the measurements using the GPR model.

AB The metaverse network economy is built on the blockchain protocol network and occurs in the metaverse virtual space by the virtual digital avatar. This is a series of economic activities that produce, exchange, distribute and consume digital products, and interact, integrate and promote with the real economy in real space. The network economic system of the metaverse is gradually formed in the process of adapting to the development of digital economy. While these products and services bring convenience, they are accompanied by more complex and diverse economic risks. Based on transformer serialization analysis, this paper proposes an analytical method of economic risk mechanism of metacosmic network to complete the evaluation of economic risk. First, this work proposes an improved transformer (ITransformer). The probabilistic sparse self-attention (PSSA) and self-attention distillation (SAD) are proposed to improve the performance. This can mine more discriminative temporal features. Secondly, this work designed a dual-stream ITransformer (DSIT) to evaluate the economic risks of the metaverse network via ITransformer. This can process the global and local features in the metaverse economic data with high performance. Finally, this work has performed massive experiments on dual-stream ITransformer pipeline. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of DSIT.

TI PL-Net: towards deep learning-based localization for underwater terrain
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Underwater localization; Terrain matching; 3D point cloud; Deep learning
AB Underwater terrain matching localization is a method for achieving precise localization by using the features of submarine topography to perform relevant matching operations. Existing underwater terrain matching algorithms suffer from issues such as limited application range, poor real-time performance, and low localization accuracy because of the variable carrier motion state, insignificant undulatory features of underwater terrain, and low underwater terrain data measurement stability. To solve the above problems, we present PL-Net, a novel learning-based underwater terrain matching localization method. First, we extract the terrain's keypoints to avoid the complexity of large-scale computation and improve the algorithm's real-time performance. Then, the pretrained deep neural network automatically extracts the high-level terrain features, avoiding the manual setting of feature extraction patterns, reducing the probability of localization failure caused by environmental and equipment factors, and improving the algorithm's robustness. Finally, we improve the localization accuracy by adding a self-attention mechanism that enables the network to adjust the weights of each component and pay more attention to the regions with significant features. We conducted a series of tests to validate the proposed method. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms other methods, indicating that our method can achieve accurate and real-time localization in a wide range of underwater environments.

AB In this paper, we present a new feature selection algorithm for supervised problems. We build our algorithm upon recently proposed infinite feature selection (Inf-FS) method where features are ranked based on path integrals and the centrality concept on a feature adjacency graph. The proposed algorithm firstly clusters the feature space into a predefined number of subspaces. Then ranks the features in each subspace using Inf-FS method. Finally merges the resultant subranks using a combined measure of information theory and clusters size. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on six benchmark datasets, and show that our method outperforms Inf-FS in terms of the accuracy, running time, and memory consumption. The codes are available at https://github.com/Sadegh28/CInf-FS.

AB Current supportive bio-inspired design methods focus on handcrafting the inspiration engineers use to speed up bio-inspired design. However promising, such methods are not scalable as the time investment is shifted to an up-front investment. Furthermore, most proposed methods require the engineer to adopt a new design process. The current study presents FISh, a scalable search method based on the standard engineering design process. By leveraging machine translation between a representative corpus of biological and engineering texts, the engineer can start the search using engineering terminology, which, behind the scenes, is automatically converted to a biological query. This conversion is done using language models trained on patents and biological publications for the engineering and biology domains. Both models are aligned using the most used English words. The biological query is used to retrieve biological documents that describe the most relevant functionality for the engineering query. The presented method allows searching for bio-inspiration using a free-text query. Furthermore, updating the underlying datasets, models and organism aspects is automated, allowing the system to stay up to date without requiring interactive effort. Finally, the search functionality is validated by comparing the search results for the functionality of existing bio-inspired designs with their inspiring organisms.

AB Utilizing vast annotated datasets for supervised training of deep learning models is an absolute necessity. The focus of this paper is to demonstrate a supervisory training technique using perspective transformation-based data augmentation to train various cutting-edge architectures for the ego-lane detection task. Creating a reliable dataset for training such models has been challenging due to the lack of efficient augmentation methods that can produce new annotated images without missing important features about the lane or the road. Based on extensive experiments for training the three architectures: SegNet, U-Net, and ResUNet++, we show that the perspective transformation data augmentation strategy noticeably improves the performance of the models. The model achieved validation dice of 0.991 when ResUNET++ was trained on data of size equal to 6000 using the PTA method and achieved a dice coefficient of 96.04% when had been tested on the KITTI Lane benchmark, which contains 95 images for different urban scenes, which exceeds the results of the other papers. An ensemble learning approach is also introduced while testing the models to achieve the most robust performance under various challenging conditions.

ID NORMALIZATION
AB In current end-to-end environmental sound classification model, fixed-size filters are difficult to balance the time-frequency resolution while the weight setting of each scale is hard to reflect their importances when using multi-scale filters. Therefore, an end-to-end environmental sound classification method based on multi-scale attention residual network is proposed in this paper, which make full use of attention mechanism, muti-scale fusion and residual network structure. A weighted fusion of features at different scales by attention mechanism is utilized for better feature representation. Meanwhile, the residual structure, instead of the normal one-dimensional convolution layer, is taken into account, which alleviates the problems of gradient explosion and gradient disappearance, and accelerates the model training process. Experiments on the environmental sound datasets ESC-10, ESC-50 and UrbanSound8k show that our MSARN model achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9, 79.4 and 95.4%, respectively, which is better than other mainstream end-to-end methods. Compared with the single scale model, the accuracy is improved from 8.9 to 15.2%.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT; NETWORK
AB To address the issues of incomplete dehazing and low dehazing efficiency in existing dehazing networks, this study introduces a Lightweight Contrast-Regularized Dilated Attention Network (LCDA-Net) for single-image dehazing. Initially, Attention Context Encoding (ACE) is employed to decompose the input image into high-frequency and low-frequency features. For the low-frequency features, which are significantly impacted by haze, a pyramid dehazing module based on large-kernel dilated convolutional attention is devised, facilitating efficient dehazing through complementary semantic information. In contrast, for high-frequency features, a detail enhancement module based on deformable convolution is designed to restore fine texture information. Subsequently, high-frequency and low-frequency features are merged to reconstruct a clear image. Lastly, a loss function is designed by incorporating contrast regularization and edge loss strategies, effectively guiding the network to generate more realistic images. In this network, depthwise separable convolutions replace traditional convolutions, significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining satisfactory dehazing performance. Experimental results on the RESIDE benchmark dataset demonstrate that, compared to other advanced methods, the proposed approach achieves superior dehazing outcomes for both synthetic and real haze images, effectively mitigating artifacts, distortions, and incomplete dehazing. The PSNR on the SOTS indoor and outdoor test sets reaches 31.73 dB and 29.31 dB, respectively, with a network parameter size of merely 2 M. Additionally, the proposed method exhibits the lowest model complexity while achieving optimal performance metrics and the highest FPS, indicating both its superior dehazing performance and low complexity.

AB Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) image segmentation has received more and more attention in recent years. Domain adaptive methods can align the features of data in different domains, so that segmentation models can be migrated to data in other domains without incurring additional labeling costs. The traditional adversarial training uses the global alignment strategy to align the feature space, which may cause some categories to be incorrectly mapped. At the same time, in high-spatial resolution remote sensing images (RSI), the same category from different scenes (such as urban and rural areas) may have completely different distributions, which severely limits the accuracy of UDA. In order to solve these problems, in this paper: (1) a multi-level adversarial network at category-level is proposed, aiming at integrating feature information in different dimensions, studying the joint distribution at category-level, and aligning each category with adaptive adversarial loss in different dimensional spaces. (2) Use covariance regularization to optimize self-training. A method combining self-training with adversarial training is proposed, optimizes the domain adaptation effect, reduces the negative impact of false pseudo-label iteration caused by self-training. We demonstrated the latest performance of semantic segmentation on challenging LoveDA datasets. Experiments on "urban-to-rural" and "rural-to-urban" show that our method has better performance than the most advanced methods.

AB At present, the mainstream mode of machine learning algorithms is the data-driven method, which mainly relies on the self-learning ability of deep neural networks and continuously evolving models in data-driven training. However, the pure data-driven method has some critical problems, such as high data collection cost, poor interpretability and easy to be be disturbed by noise. Although the knowledge-driven method has high stability, it lacks self-learning and evolution ability in the face of comprehensive and complex problems. In recent years, the convergence of data and domain knowledge has combined the advantages of both learning paradigms. One typical way is to embed domain knowledge into the data-driven model to improve the interpretability of the model, and then use the self-learning ability of the data-driven model to explore knowledge, and continuously iterate the domain knowledge to form a closed loop. The data-knowledge dual-driven methods have brought transformative innovations in machine learning. This review first introduced the advantages and necessity of the data-knowledge dual-driven model in the field of artificial intelligence. Then, the applications of the data-knowledge dual-driven model in the smart marine field were introduced. Finally, the challenges and trends of the data-knowledge dual-driven artificial intelligence are anticipated.

AB In this study, we propose a novel encoder-decoder cycle (EDC) framework inspired by the human learning process called the perception-action cycle to tackle challenging problems such as visual question answering (VQA) and visual relationship detection (VRD). EDC considers the understanding of the visual features of an image as perception and the act of answering the question regarding that image as an action. In the perception-action cycle, information is primarily collected from the environment and then passed to sensory structures in the brain to form an understanding of the environment. Acquired knowledge is then passed to motor structures to perform an action on the environment. Next, sensory structures perceive the altered environment and improve their understanding of the surrounding world. This process of understanding the environment, performing an action correspondingly, and then re-evaluating the initial understanding occurs cyclically in human life. EDC initially mimics this mechanism of introspection by comprehending and refining visual features to acquire the proper knowledge for answering the question. Subsequently, it decodes visual and language features into answer features, feeding them back cyclically to the encoder. In the VRD task, EDC decodes visual features to generate predicate features. We evaluate the proposed framework on the TDIUC, VQA 2.0, and VRD datasets, which outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the TDIUC and VRD datasets.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing image registration is the key step of remote sensing image stitching, image fusion and multi-frames image super-resolution. Its speed and accuracy determines the effect of remote sensing image applications, such as object detection, environment monitoring. To meet the speed and accuracy requirements of UAV remote sensing image registration, an improved Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF- Random sample consensus (ORB-RANSAC) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, images to be registered are divided into non-overlapping sub-images, and then a simplified image pyramid is constructed for these subimages to get scale invariance. Secondly, the traditional FAST corner detection algorithm is improved by setting the adaptive corner detection threshold, and more feature points are detected. Meanwhile, the traditional quadtree algorithm is improved to remove redundant feature points and keep the remaining high-quality feature points. Thirdly, feature points coarse matching is done by bidirectional matching combined with cosine similarity method. Finally, the improved RANSAC algorithm is used for feature points fine matching to eliminate mismatches and calculate the transformation matrix. Experiment results show that, comparing with the traditional ORB algorithm, the number of feature points detected is significantly increased and its distribution is more uniform, and the correct matching rate increases by 58.10% in the case of image scale changing. Comparing with the state-of-the-art UAV remote sensing image registration algorithm, the correct matching rate and mutual information of our method are increased by 0.68% and 1.91% respectively, matching time and root mean square error are reduced by 3.89% and 11.2% respectively.

ID PREDICTION
AB In order to guarantee the desired quality of machined products, a reliable surface roughness assessment is essential. Using a surface profile metre with a contact stylus, which can produce accurate measurements of surface profiles, is the most popular technique for determining the surface roughness of machined items. One of the limitations of this technique is the work piece surface degradation brought on by mechanical contact between the stylus and the surface. Hence, in this paper, a roughness assessment technique based on the suggested Taylor-Gorilla troops optimizer-based Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Network (Taylor-GTO based DNFN) is proposed for estimating the surface roughness. Pre-processing, data augmentation, feature extraction, feature fusion, and roughness estimation are the procedures that the suggested technique uses to complete the roughness estimate procedure. Roughness estimation is performed using DNFN that has been trained using Taylor-GTO, which was created by combining the Taylor series with the Gorilla troop's optimizer. The created Taylor-GTO based DNFN model has minimum Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, and RMSE of 0.403, 0.416, and 1.149, respectively.

AB Infrared and visible image fusion aims to highlight the infrared target and preserve valuable texture details as much as possible. However, the infrared target needs to be more apparent in most image fusion methods. A large amount of infrared noise remains in the fusion results, significantly reducing the proportion of valuable texture details in the fusion results. How to highlight the salient of infrared targets, lower noise, and retain more valuable texture details in the fusion results still need to be solved. We propose an adaptive salient region analysis method based on superpixels (SSRA) for infrared and visible fusion to solve this problem. This method uses salient region analysis based on superpixels to highlight the salience region effectively. We design a texture detail fusion method based on brightness analysis of the visible image to suppress noise and keep more meaningful texture detail information. The experimental results show that our proposed method performs better in subjective vision and quantitative evaluation than some advanced methods. In addition, we also demonstrate that SSRA is capable of supporting high-level visual tasks well. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/VCMHE/SSRA.

AB Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are commonly employed to mitigate network security threats in various fields, including federated learning applications within the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, IDSs face challenges owing to the sheer volume of network traffic, high-dimensional datasets and the necessity for real-time detection. Although machine learning integration assists IDSs in overcoming these challenges, modelling difficulties persist due to varied evaluation criteria and levels of conflict and importance. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) solutions have been utilised in IoMT and IDS, yet they fall short in capturing the subjective judgements of experts and rely on normalisation approaches, which can impact results. This study seeks to address these issues through the integration of robust MCDM methodologies, namely fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM). Utilising rough Fermatean fuzzy sets (RFFSs), this integration produces precise solutions with reduced uncertainty. Our methodology involves adopting a decision matrix for IDS classifiers based on integrated evaluation criteria, followed by deriving new formulations and developments for RFFSs-based FDOSM and FWZIC for the modelling and weighting of criteria, respectively. Evaluations using datasets involving 125,973 records and 41 features across 17 evaluation criteria revealed that accuracy-security and training time-performance weights yielded the highest scores, whereas false negative rate-security and CPU time-performance criteria received the lowest weights. The random forest emerged as the optimal IDS classifier. Systematic modelling, sensitivity analysis and comparative studies confirmed the robustness of our results.

DE Dynamic Context Removal; Video Action Anticipation; Early Action
   Recognition; Robustness
AB Predicting future actions is an essential feature of intelligent systems and embodied AI. However, compared to the traditional recognition tasks, the uncertainty of the future and the reasoning ability requirement make prediction tasks very challenging and far beyond solved. In this field, previous methods usually care more about the model architecture design but little attention has been put on how to train models with a proper learning policy. To this end, in this work, we propose a simple but effective training strategy, Dynamic Context Removal (DCR), which dynamically schedules the visibility of context in different training stages. It follows the human-like curriculum learning process, i.e., gradually removing the event context to increase the prediction difficulty till satisfying the final prediction target. Besides, we explore how to train robust models that give consistent predictions at different levels of observable context. Our learning scheme is plug-and-play and easy to integrate widely-used reasoning models including Transformer and LSTM, with advantages in both effectiveness and efficiency. We study two action prediction problems, i.e., Video Action Anticipation and Early Action Recognition. In extensive experiments, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several widely-used benchmarks.

DE Multi-label image recognition; Single-positive label; Contrastive
   learning; Semantic guidance
AB Learning multi-label image recognition with incomplete annotation is gaining popularity due to its superior performance and significant labor savings when compared to training with fully labeled datasets. Existing literature mainly focuses on label completion and co-occurrence learning while facing difficulties with the most common single-positive label manner. To tackle this problem, we present a semantic contrastive bootstrapping (Scob) approach to gradually recover the cross-object relationships by introducing class activation as semantic guidance. With this learning guidance, we then propose a recurrent semantic masked transformer to extract iconic object-level representations and delve into the contrastive learning problems on multi-label classification tasks. We further propose a bootstrapping framework in an Expectation-Maximization fashion that iteratively optimizes the network parameters and refines semantic guidance to alleviate possible disturbance caused by wrong semantic guidance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed joint learning framework surpasses the state-of-the-art models by a large margin on four public multi-label image recognition benchmarks. Codes can be found at https:// github.com/ iCVTEAM/ Scob.

The feature information not only reflects the image information but also covers the feature extraction ability of the teacher network. However, the existing feature distillation methods lack theoretical guidance for feature map evaluation and suffer from the mismatch of sizes between high-dimensional feature maps and low-dimensional feature maps, and poor information utilization. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Feature Map Pruning Method (AFMPM) for feature distillation, which transforms the problem of feature map pruning into the problem of optimization so that the valid information of the feature map is retained to the maximum extent. AFMPM has achieved significant improvements in feature distillation, and the advanced and generalized nature of the method has been verified by conducting experiments on the teacher-student distillation framework and the self-distillation framework.

AB In the domain of streaming recommender systems, conventional methods for addressing new user IDs or item IDs typically involve assigning initial ID embeddings randomly. However, this practice results in two practical challenges: (i) Items or users with limited interactive data may yield suboptimal prediction performance. (ii) Embedding new IDs or low-frequency IDs necessitates consistently expanding the embedding table, leading to unnecessary memory consumption. In light of these concerns, we introduce a reinforcement learning-driven framework, namely AutoAssign+, that facilitates Automatic Shared Embedding Assignment Plus. To be specific, AutoAssign+ utilizes an Identity Agent as an actor network, which plays a dual role: (i) representing low-frequency IDs field-wise with a small set of shared embeddings to enhance the embedding initialization and (ii) dynamically determining which ID features should be retained or eliminated in the embedding table. The policy of the agent is optimized with the guidance of a critic network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform extensive experiments on three commonly used benchmark datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that AutoAssign+ is capable of significantly enhancing recommendation performance by mitigating the cold-start problem. Furthermore, our framework yields a reduction in memory usage of approximately 20-30%, verifying its practical effectiveness and efficiency for streaming recommender systems.

AB Next activity prediction of business processes (BPs) provides valid execution information of ongoing (i.e., unfinished) process instances, which enables process executors to rationally allocate resources and detect process deviations in advance. Current researches on next activity prediction, however, concentrate mostly on model construction without in-depth analysis of historical event logs. In this article, we are dedicated to proposing an approach to forecast the next activity effectively in BPs. After in-depth analysis of historical event logs, three types of candidate activity attributes are defined and calculated as additional input for the prediction based on three essential elements, that is, frequent activity patterns, trace similarity and position information. Furthermore, we construct an effective hybrid prediction model combining the popular convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) with self-attention mechanism. Specifically, CNN is used to extract the temporal features before importing into Bi-LSTM for accurate prediction, and self-attention mechanism is applied to strengthen features that have decisive effects on the prediction results. Comparison experiments on four real-life datasets demonstrate that our hybrid model with selected attributes achieves better performance on next activity prediction than single models, and improves the prediction accuracy by 2.98%, 6.05%, 2.70% and 5.26% on Helpdesk, Sepsis, BPIC2013 Incidents and BPIC2012O datasets than the state-of-the-art methods, respectively.

AB The automotive parts industry cluster is a complex operating system, and it is no longer possible to use a simple theory to make a scientific and reasonable explanation for the parts industry cluster. In view of this, the study takes the automotive parts industry cluster as the research object, innovatively invokes the theory of organizational ecology and constructs a competitiveness analysis mechanism based on population co-evolution. The study conducts performance analysis and simulation tests on the constructed model, integrating the CS-AHP evaluation method to evaluate the competitiveness of the parts industry cluster. The performance comparison results show that the research method has a minimum training error of 0.0108, when the number of iterations of the system is 69th. This method has a stable loss function value at the fifth iteration, which is a stable convergence state earlier than the GA algorithm, differential evolution and distribution estimation algorithm. The A-level index score of the off-line platform auto parts industry cluster is 0.5174, which is significantly greater than 0.5. The competitive cooperation effect, technological innovation effect and cluster culture scores of the e-commerce platform are 0.5885, 0.6899 and 0.5329, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the off-line. The above results show that the accuracy of the research algorithm is higher than that of the off-line industry. The above results show that the accuracy of the research algorithm is better, which can make a reasonable scientific basis for the auto parts industry and carry out competitiveness evaluation. To a certain extent, it can provide technical reference for the future development of the auto field industry.

AB In recent years, precise medical image segmentation methods based on the encoder-decoder structure have attracted much attention, but there are still some limitations. They mainly manifest in two aspects: one is that the network structure becomes increasingly complex in pursuit of segmentation ac-curacy, and the other is the insufficient multiscale information fusion ability between the encoder and decoder. To address these issues, we designed a novel lightweight precise medical image segmentation network called UcUNet, which has not only a very large receptive field and multiscale information fusion ability but also a low parameter count. Specifically, we first designed an efficient U-shaped convolution module that can increase the network depth with fewer parameters and effectively filter out invalid features while fusing shallow and deep features. Furthermore, we ingeniously introduced large-kernel convolution into this module, which significantly improved the network's receptive field with very few parameters, providing new ideas for the use of large-kernel convolution in lightweight models. In addition, we designed a self-adjusting multiscale feature fusion module based on large-kernel convolution to replace the original simple skip connections, effectively enhancing the network's multiscale information extraction and fusion ability. Finally, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets, and the results showed that our method can achieve precise medical image segmentation with a low parameter count.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Pansharpening strives to improve the spatial resolution of multi-spectral images while maintaining spectral fidelity. However, existing methods usually cannot guarantee a balance between spatial and spectral quality, and degrade when handling the desirable scale of full resolution. To address these challenges, this prospective study proposes a scale-transfer learning framework via estimating spectral observation model. Specifically, we design a cross-spectral transfer network to learn an expected spectral observation model by the cycle adversarial between spectral degradation and interpolation, which describes the accurate nonlinear mapping process from multi-spectral to panchromatic images. Having the favorable spectral observation model established, a scale-transfer pansharpening paradigm with co-learning of full and reduced resolutions can be constructed. First, we develop a spectral observation model-based spatial fidelity term at the reduced-resolution scale, which can alleviate the imbalance problem of spectral and spatial information widespread in current supervised paradigms. Second, we explore the reprojection regularization from full to reduced resolution based on the spectral observation model, which facilitates the ability of the pansharpening model to be extended to the scale of full resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantage of our method over the current state-of-the-arts in terms of information balance and scale transformation. We further apply our method to produce the high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index and achieve vegetation enhancement with competitive performance. Moreover, our method is lightweight and faster than other comparative methods.

AB To reduce the computational complexity of training a deep neural network architecture using large data sets of 3D scenes, a competitive learning scheme was devised. The proposed algorithm pits a neural network learning algorithm, in this case the standard Adam optimiser, against an evolutionary algorithm that is used to select the most difficult training examples. The overall scheme is similar to a predator-prey system, where the predator (the neural network) strives to optimise its ability to capture (identify) the prey (the training patterns), and the evolutionary procedure selects the prey that so far evaded capture. As a consequence of the evolutionary process, the neural network is presented only a fraction of the training examples, and the computational complexity of the learning procedure is reduced. Experimental evidence showed that the proposed scheme allows reducing the deep neural network training time on different model sets, sometimes significantly, without affecting the recognition accuracy. The proposed predator-prey scheme is fairly independent of the ANN type and training algorithm employed, and has the potential to be beneficial to a wide range of deep learning applications, where practical implementations are often hindered by the time complexity of the training process.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Our method combines neurodynamic optimization and deep neural networks. First, we model the stochastic two-player zero-sum game as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system using neurodynamic optimization. Second, we develop a neural network to approximate the solution to the ODE system, which includes the saddle point prediction for the game problem. Third, we introduce a specialized algorithm for training the neural network to enhance the accuracy of the saddle point prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing approaches, yielding faster convergence and more accurate saddle point predictions.

AB Gas composition and light mode of industrial greenhouses are some of the most determining factors in the process of growing vegetable crops in greenhouse conditions. The intelligentisation of information technologies for monitoring and control based on artificial intelligence methods can increase the efficiency of agrotechnical procedures for greenhouse cultivation. One of the efficient approaches in today's world practice is the development and implementation of trustworthy hybrid decision-support systems based on the techniques of Fuzzy logic and Human-in-the-Loop. The research object is non-stationary processes of complex intelligent transformation of measurement data on the concentration of carbon dioxide and effective energy illumination in the growing zone of industrial greenhouses. The scientific novelty and practical value of the obtained research results consist in creating a computer model for aggregation and intelligent processing of agricultural monitoring data for greenhouses. The developed computer model is fully transformed into peripheral-level software of Internet of Things systems for agricultural purposes. This makes it possible to implement the for-computing architecture of monitoring systems in greenhouses. The obtained research results make it possible to optimise the resources used in growing crops in greenhouse conditions through the implementation of hardware and software intelligent monitoring tools that are adaptive to the types and periods of crop vegetation. The scientific and applied effect of the research is creating the novel approach of development and practical use of intelligent technologies for agrotechnical monitoring by substantiating the methodological provisions for synthesis of structural and algorithmic organisation of the corresponding software and hardware solutions.

ID QUALITY EVALUATION; SYSTEM
AB In recent years, there has been a notable upswing in the realm of innovation and entrepreneurship education for Chinese students, leading to remarkable advancements. However, students' initiatives in this field fall short of the desired standards. The current evaluation index system is insufficient for meeting the developmental needs of colleges and universities. Therefore, exploring innovative approaches and implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework become crucial. This research analyzes the limitations of the current evaluation system, which focuses on curriculum, teaching materials, management, research output, student employment, entrepreneurship awareness, and participation. Unfortunately, this narrow approach has a significant impact on the quality of education in this field. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel evaluation system for assessing students' innovation and entrepreneurship education by utilizing the capabilities of backpropagation (BP) neural network. We researched the conceptual framework, components, and learning process of BP neural network. Additionally, we provide a thorough description of the calculation process and structure of the BP neural network algorithm by facilitating stakeholders' understanding. Our study aims to strengthen the landscape of education by developing a culture of excellence. We developed a robust evaluation system with well-defined indexes calibrated to capture the essence of this education. Through precise training and analysis, we achieved remarkable results, with a maximum difference of 1.6% between the anticipated and actual output. This highlights the accuracy of our model in assessing teaching quality. We also thoroughly compared several kinds of assessment methods for the growth of students' entrepreneurial and innovative skills that have been presented in the literature. Based on the simulation results, we discovered that our model performs better as compared to the existing model. Based on the evidence, innovation and entrepreneurship education in Chinese institutions can be characterized as moderate. This finding lays the foundation for further advancements, fostering a future where educational excellence and entrepreneurial spirit thrive.

AB Traffic signs are the globally essential map features for the era of autonomous driving and smart cities. Traffic sign recognition is a difficult task due to their multiple shapes, sizes, color, occlusions and complicated driving scenes. For automatic traffic signs and classification, a robust and efficient system is needed with a highly accurate prediction rate. Therefore, a novel goat-based convolutional neural-Kalman framework (GbCN-KF) is proposed to detect the traffic signs for smart cities. Primarily, the input traffic sign images are noise-filtered by the Kalman function and the relative features for the recognition process were extracted. Further, traffic signs are recognized by matching the features with the trained set and classified using the goat fitness function. The system is tested with the BTSC and GTSRB database. The performance score was evaluated for the datasets and compared with the prevailing recognition models. The model recorded a high accuracy percentage of 99.89% and 99.94% for the tested BTSC and GTSRB datasets.

AB In recent years, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem and its variants have attracted wide attention from the perspective of theory and practice. In many projects, the amounts of the work content for the activities are specified, while the activities are executed in different modes of discrete duration and resource consumption per time. This paper focuses on this specific generalization of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem, known as the discrete time/resource trade-off problem (DTRTP). An efficient mathematical model for the DTRTP with renewable resource types is presented. Since this problem is NP-hard, a hybrid heuristic/meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the deterministic model in large sizes. Then, a critical chain project management approach is employed to handle the uncertainty of activities' work contents. Finally, several numerical examples based on the previous studies and generated examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed procedure. The proposed hybrid algorithm for deterministic cases is statistically compared with an existing exact optimization tool. The simulation-based statistical analyses showed that the proposed hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm could find global optimums for small-sized cases in shorter run times. While the exact solver cannot solve medium- and large-sized problems, the proposed nested algorithm reaches high-quality local solutions in suitable run times. Also, the simulations indicated that the proposed project scheduling can face uncertainty, at least in 77% of the cases.

AB Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) is one of the effective ways to solve the problem of intelligent connected vehicle perception, and the core is to fuse the information sensed by vehicle sensors with that sensed by infrastructure sensors. However, accurately matching the objects detected by the vehicle with multiple objects detected by the infrastructure remains a challenge. This paper presents an object association matching method to fuse the object information from vehicle sensors and roadside sensors, enabling the matching and fusion of multiple target information. The proposed object association matching algorithm consists of three steps. First, the deployment method for vehicle sensors and roadside sensors is designed. Then, the laser point cloud data from the roadside sensors are processed using the DBSCAN algorithm to extract the object information on the road. Finally, an improved single-pass algorithm for object association matching is proposed to achieve the matched target by setting a change threshold for selection. To validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, real-vehicle experiments are conducted. Furthermore, the improved single-pass algorithm is compared with the classical Hungarian algorithm, Kuhn-Munkres (KM) algorithm, and nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the improved single-pass algorithm achieves a target trajectory matching accuracy of 0.937, which is 6.60%, 1.85%, and 2.07% higher than the above-mentioned algorithms, respectively. In addition, this paper investigates the curvature of the target vehicle trajectory data after fusing vehicle sensing information and roadside sensing information. The curvature mean, curvature variance, and curvature standard deviation are analyzed. The experimental results illustrate that the fused target information is more accurate and effective. The method proposed in this study contributes to the advancement of the theoretical system of V2I cooperative perception and provides theoretical support for the development of intelligent connected vehicles.

AB Link prediction aims to predict missing links or eliminate spurious links by employing known complex network information. As an unsupervised linear feature representation method, matrix factorization (MF)-based autoencoder (AE) can project the high-dimensional data matrix into the low-dimensional latent space. However, most of the traditional link prediction methods based on MF or AE adopt shallow models and single adjacency matrices, which cannot adequately learn and represent network features and are susceptible to noise. In addition, because some methods require the input of symmetric data matrix, they can only be used in undirected networks. Therefore, we propose a deep manifold matrix factorization autoencoder model using global connectivity matrix, called DM-MFAE-G. The model utilizes PageRank algorithm to get the global connectivity matrix between nodes for the complex network. DM-MFAE-G performs deep matrix factorization on the local adjacency matrix and global connectivity matrix, respectively, to obtain global and local multi-layer feature representations, which contains the rich structural information. In this paper, the model is solved by alternating iterative optimization method, and the convergence of the algorithm is proved. Comprehensive experiments on different real networks demonstrate that the global connectivity matrix and manifold constraints introduced by DM-MFAE-G significantly improve the link prediction performance on directed and undirected networks.

   Collaborative filtering
AB Recently, graph neural networks have demonstrated superior performance in the field of collaborative filtering (CF). The graph collaborative filtering (GCF) method learns the interactions between users and items, whose performance is susceptible to sparse data. Self-supervised contrastive learning, which provides additional pseudo-labels besides the interaction data, has been widely adopted by existing GCF methods to solve the data sparsity problem. Despite their success, most existing methods destroy the semantics and ignore the community structure of the graph, thus failing to exploit the full potential of contrastive learning. In this work, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning paradigm called Community-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning (CA-GCL), which explicitly incorporates the community structure into contrastive learning to gain recommendations. Specifically, instead of random graph augmentation, we perform graph partitioning on the user-item bipartite graph in the pre-processing stage and construct the contrastive pairs based on the partitioning results, which in turn facilitates the representation learning of the model to gain downstream recommendation tasks. In addition, we add virtual nodes to the original graph based on the communities to accelerate the convergence of the model. Compared with the existing work, CA-GCL directly learns through the community structure of the graph, which ensures the high efficiency of the model while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark datasets, and the results show that CA-GCL significantly outperforms other graph collaborative filtering methods, demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of CA-GCL.

AB Subspace clustering is very significant and widely used in computer vision and pattern recognition. Traditional self-expressive subspace clustering methods usually separate similarity measurement and data clustering into two steps, so they fail to fully consider the interdependence between them. Moreover, since some graph parameters need to be defined in advance, it is difficult to select the optimal graph parameters, which leads to the loss of local smoothness. Furthermore, classic methods are optimal for independent and identically distributed gaussian noise but sensitive to outliers. To solve the above problems effectively, one-step subspace clustering based on adaptive graph regularization and correntropy induced metric (OSCA) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, OSCA applies subspace structured norm to measure the uncertainty of two steps of similarity measurement and data clustering, integrating these two independent steps into a unified framework. Meanwhile, according to the local connectivity of data, an adaptive optimal neighborhood is assigned to each data point to learn the coefficient matrix, so that the global structure and local structure of data can be considered. In addition, the correntropy, which is insensitive to outliers, is cleverly exploited to calculate the reconstruction error to handle complex noise better. Finally, the HQ-ADMM algorithm (an efficient interactive algorithm) is proposed to optimize the model. Experimental results on ten datasets of four types show that the proposed method can significantly improve the clustering performance.

AB Structure-constrained molecular optimisation aims to improve the target pharmacological properties of input molecules through small perturbations of the molecular structures. Previous studies have exploited various optimisation techniques to satisfy the requirements of structure-constrained molecular optimisation tasks. However, several studies have encountered difficulties in producing property-improved and synthetically feasible molecules. To achieve both property improvement and synthetic feasibility of molecules, we proposed a molecular structure editing model called SELF-EdiT that uses self-referencing embedded strings (SELFIES) and Levenshtein transformer models. The SELF-EdiT generates new molecules that resemble the seed molecule by iteratively applying fragment-based deletion-and-insertion operations to SELFIES. The SELF-EdiT exploits a grammar-based SELFIES tokenization method and the Levenshtein transformer model to efficiently learn deletion-and-insertion operations for editing SELFIES. Our results demonstrated that SELF-EdiT outperformed existing structure-constrained molecular optimisation models by a considerable margin of success and total scores on the two benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we confirmed that the proposed model could improve the pharmacological properties without large perturbations of the molecular structures through edit-path analysis. Moreover, our fragment-based approach significantly relieved the SELFIES collapse problem compared to the existing SELFIES-based model. SELF-EdiT is the first attempt to apply editing operations to the SELFIES to design an effective editing-based optimisation, which can be helpful for fellow researchers planning to utilise the SELFIES.

AB The coronavirus outbreak is a recent pandemic that destroyed most of the lives, economy, and livelihoods. The detection of COVID-19 is the main aim to detect and provide better treatment for patients to mitigate its impact. In addition, it is necessary to diagnose the disease swiftly with upgraded technologies. This can be achieved by CT image scanning. This provides the fastest detection of the disease. Moreover, it can also be used to diagnose the percentage of the affected lung areas. To perform this fastly, we propose a novel approach known as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Improved Grey Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm. The proposed CNN utilizes a SegNet-based approach which can be used to detect the affected area in the lungs by using the encoder and decoder steps. The encoder in this approach uses three types of CNN architecture. First, the decoder is used to reconstruct the images. The overfitting issues during the iterations and complexities are reduced by adopting the IGWO approach. The experimental analysis depicts that the proposed approach effectively segments the CT images and promptly diagnoses the affected lung area.

AB The flexibility, adaptability, and resilience of even simple brains are unmatched by any current technology. Recent unexpected difficulties in realising truly autonomous vehicles, making reliable medical diagnoses, detecting offensive online content and even just recognising faces, show that brains remain significantly functionally more capable than we can currently emulate. Fittingly, in recent years we have made significant progress identifying computational principles that underlie neural function. We are beginning to dispense with the overly simplistic stimulus-driven encode/transmit/decode doctrine. Instead we must embrace the brain's inherent dynamic complexity and emergent properties and explain how plasticity moulds the dynamics to capture useful couplings across brain regions and between the brain, the body, and the world. While certainly not complete, we have sufficient evidence that a synthesis of these ideas could result in a deeper understanding of neural computation and which could potentially be used to construct new AI technologies with unique capabilities. I discuss the relevant neuroscientific principles, the advantages they have for computation, and how they can benefit AI. Limitations of current AI are now generally recognised. I postulate that we understand enough about the brain to immediately offer novel AI formulations.

ID CONCEPT DRIFT; ALGORITHM; SELECTION
AB In a streaming environment, the characteristics and labels of instances may change over time, forming concept drifts. Previous studies on data stream learning generally assume that the true label of each instance is available or easily obtained, which is impractical in many real-world applications due to expensive time and labor costs for labeling. To address the issue, an active broad learning based on multi-objective evolutionary optimization is presented to classify non-stationary data stream. The instance newly arrived at each time step is stored to a chunk in turn. Once the chunk is full, its data distribution is compared with previous ones by fast local drift detection to seek potential concept drift. Taking diversity of instances and their relevance to new concept into account, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced to find the most valuable candidate instances. Among them, representative ones are randomly selected to query their ground-truth labels, and then update broad learning model for drift adaption. More especially, the number of representative is determined by the stability of adjacent historical chunks. Experimental results for 7 synthetic and 5 real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms five state-of-the-art ones on classification accuracy and labeling cost due to drift regions accurately identified and the labeling budget adaptively adjusted.

AB Promoting cooperation in the network has always been a focus of evolutionary game dynamics research. In this paper, a three-strategy local decision model is designed to promote cooperative behavior between agents. The hide right is introduced to accurately describe the agents which tend to choose conservative strategy to achieve stable payoffs. Agents only consider their own and non-defective neighbors' payoffs information to make their decisions for next move. According to the adaptive dynamics, the equilibrium states under different conditions have been studied. It is found that the introduction of hide strategy helps to reduce the occurrence of defection. The conclusion of this paper will provide a reference for the cooperation promotion mechanism of selfish agents that are closer to the actual situation.

ID SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION
AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) aims to reduce the cost of collecting dense pixel-level annotations for segmentation models by adopting weak labels to train. Although WSSS methods have achieved great success, recent approaches mainly concern the image-level label-based WSSS, which is limited to object-centric datasets instead of more challenging practical datasets that contain many co-occurrent classes. In comparison, point-level labels could provide some spatial information to address the class co-occurrent confusion problem. Meanwhile, it only requires an additional click when recognizing the targets, which is of negligible annotation overhead. Thus, we choose to study utilizing point labels for the general-purpose WSSS. The main difficulty of utilizing point-level labels is bridging the gap between the sparse point-level labels and the dense pixel-level predictions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a superpixel augmented pseudo-mask generation strategy and a class-aware contrastive learning approach, which manages to recover reliable dense constraints and apply them both to the segmentation models' final prediction and the intermediate features. Diagnostic experiments on the challenging Pascal VOC, Cityscapes, and the ADE20k datasets demonstrate that our approach can efficiently and effectively compensate for the sparse point-level labels and achieve cutting-edge performance on the point-based segmentation problems.

AB Many ordinary approaches in optimization are mathematical-based. Due to the limitations of such methods, optimal problems have been commonly defined in single-objective and quadratic forms, leading to non-optimal solutions based on the main design requirements. In order to address these issues, this paper presents a new type of genetic programming (GP) called "multi-objective archived-based genetic programming (MAGP)". The absolute forms of cost functions, which are unsolvable using the conventional methods, could be assessed herein through the suggested algorithm. It is shown that in addition to the possibility of obtaining optimal single-objective solutions, It is shown that in addition to the possibility of obtaining optimal single-objective solutions, some very fruitful non-dominant solutions on the Pareto fronts would be acquired, providing the designer with a set of optimal analytical solutions which could be selected depending on the design requirements. For example, in the case studies examined in this paper, around 30,000 and 14,000 non-dominant solutions were obtained for linear and nonlinear problems, respectively, indicating the high performance of the novel proposed MAGP algorithm in acquiring non-dominant solutions in optimization problems. Generally, it is observed that obtaining and comparing optimal solutions in the quadratic form are basically unreliable and as a consequence, an optimal control problem must be analyzed in its absolute form of indices.

ID PERSONAL DATA MARKETS; CHALLENGES
AB This paper considers what liberal philosopher Michael Sandel coins the 'moral limits of markets' in relation to the idea of paying people for data about their biometrics and emotions. With Sandel arguing that certain aspects of human life (such as our bodies and body parts) should be beyond monetisation and exchange, others argue that emerging technologies such as Personal Information Management Systems can enable a fairer, paid, data exchange between the individual and the organisation, even regarding highly personal data about our bodies and emotions. With the field of data ethics rarely addressing questions of payment, this paper explores normative questions about data dividends. It does so by conducting a UK-wide, demographically representative online survey to quantitatively assess adults' views on being paid for personal data about their biometrics and emotions via a Personal Information Management System, producing a data dividend, a premise which sees personal data through the prism of markets and property. The paper finds diverse attitudes based on socio-demographic characteristics, the type of personal data sold, and the type of organisation sold to. It argues that (a) Sandel's argument regarding the moral limits of markets has value in protecting fundamental freedoms of those in society who are arguably least able to (such as the poor); but (b) that contexts of use, in particular, blur moral limits regarding fundamental freedoms and markets.

AB The growing use of automated decision-making (ADM) systems in the public sector and the need to control these has raised many legal questions in academic research and in policymaking. One of the timely means of legal control is accountability, which traditionally includes the ability to impose sanctions on the violator as one dimension. Even though many risks regarding the use of ADM have been noted and there is a common will to promote the safety of these systems, the relevance of the safety research has been discussed little in this context. In this article, I evaluate regulating accountability over the use of ADM in the public sector in relation to the findings of safety research. I conducted the study by focusing on ongoing regulatory projects regarding ADM, the Finnish ADM legislation draft and the EU proposal for the AI Act. The critical question raised in the article is what the role of sanctions is. I ask if official accountability could mean more of an opportunity to learn from mistakes, share knowledge and compensate for harm instead of control via sanctions.

AB The stochastic disturbances are common in real world and usually cause significant influence to engineering system. In this work, the stochastic disturbance is introduced into the quaternion-valued memristive neural networks (QVMNNs). The exponential input-to-state stabilization (EITSS) problem of stochastic QVMNNs is investigated. In order to be more effective and less costly in real applications, an event-triggered control strategy is adopted. The original QVMNNs are separated into four equivalent real-valued NNs by using Hamilton rule. Then, by using the Lyapunov functional approach and stochastic analysis technique, novel sufficient conditions for mean square EITSS of stochastic QVMNNs are derived. Moreover, it is proved that Zeno behavior will not take place in our event-triggered control method. Thus, the mean square EITSS problem of stochastic QVMNNs is solved in this work with less control cost. Lastly, simulation is performed to manifest the correctness of the theorem.

AB Petroleum is the main power of automobiles, yet the environmental pollution it brings has caused globally. The promotion of new energy vehicles (NEVs) is effective. Even though the governments have introduced various supports for the popularization of NEVs, many enterprises and individuals continue to drive gas vehicles as they are poorly informed about them and cannot choose the right products. This paper proposes a categorization and ranking model of NEVs over three-way decisions (TWD) to tackle the problem. Picture fuzzy sets serve as a valid tool to describe uncertainty and fuzziness information. At first, the attribute weights are ascertained with the indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis (ITARA) method improved by the picture fuzzy distance. Then, the public weight picture fuzzy data envelopment analysis (DEA) which is enhanced by the picture fuzzy aggregation operator is employed for the conditional probability of decision units. Third, updated picture fuzzy TWD is utilized for the categorization and ranking. Fourth, the enterprise NEVs selection case is tested for the model. Later, comparative analysis with the classical methods illustrates that the proposed method yields accurate and reliable decisions. Finally, the robustness of the model is demonstrated by sensitivity analysis.

AB In the era of Internet access, software is easily available on digital distribution platforms such as app stores. The distribution of software on these platforms makes user feedback more accessible and can be used from requirements engineering to software maintenance context. However, such user reviews might contain technical information about the app that can be valuable for developers and software companies. Due to pervasive use of mobile apps, a large amount of data is created by users on daily basis. Manual identification and classification of such reviews are time-consuming and laborious tasks. Hence, automating this process is essential for assisting developers in managing these reviews efficiently. Prior studies have focused on classification of these reviews into bug reports, user experience, and feature requests. Nevertheless to date, a very few research papers have extracted Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) present in these reviews. NFRs are considered as the set of quality attributes such as reliability, performance, security and usability of the software. Previous studies have utilized machine learning techniques to classify these reviews into their respective classes. However, it was observed that existing studies treat review classification problems as single-label classification problem, and also underestimate the contextual relationship between the words of review statements. To alleviate this limitation, the proposed research work used a transfer learning model to classify multi-label app reviews into four NFRs: Dependability, Performance, Supportability, and Usability. The proposed approach evaluates the performance of the pre-trained language model for multi-label review classification. In this paper, a set of experiments are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed model against the baseline machine learning with binary relevance and keyword based approach. We evaluated our approach over a dataset of 6000 user reviews of 24 iOS apps. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline techniques with respect to precision, recall, and F1-measure.

AB This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed control method based on state observer and multi-kernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) for direct current microgrid, which can suppress the false data injection attacks (FDIA) in system. Firstly, considering the problem that most of the methods have poor suppression capability for discrete attacks in sensor signals, an MKELM-based suppression method for sensor attack is proposed. MKELM is used to model the microgrid system, the output current estimated by MKELM is employed in the controller instead of the current value measured by sensors, thus avoiding the FDIA present in sensors. Secondly, an event-triggered state observer-based distributed secondary control method with H-& INFIN; consensus performance is designed for suppressing the FDIA in communication link. In the controller, a state variable is constructed by deriving the microgrid system expression as a first-order multi-agent system, and then a state observer is designed to observe the transmitted information for isolating and suppressing the attack signals. And it is proved theoretically that the proposed event-triggered controller can achieve H-& INFIN; consensus convergence. Finally, simulation analyses verify the effectiveness of the method for suppressing FDIA in DC microgrid system.

AB To improve the accuracy of human activity recognition (HAR) based on body area network (BAN), a novel spatio-temporal network combining multi-channel convolutional neural network (CNN) with graph convolutional neural network (GCN) is proposed in this paper. Based on BAN including multi-sensors, our model takes advantage of graph topological structure to represent human activity pattern. The multi-channel CNN is firstly constructed to greatly enhance learning ability to capture local representative feature. This benefits to exploit the most representative temporal activity features from time-series sensor data, overcoming the limitation of a single CNN with poor learning ability. And then the GCN with excellect extraction ability to local spatial feature is employed to discover the most representative spatial activity feature associated with the extracted temporal activity features in non-Euclidean space. This could gather the most valuable spatio-temporal dynamic activity feature hidden in human activity for HAR with high-generalization. The open wearable action recognition database dataset including all 13 actiivty patterns is used to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model. The experimental results showed that, with the limited sample data, our model can achieve the best generalization (96.01% accuracy, 95.39% precision, and 96.51% recall) to accurately detect all 13 activity patterns when compared with the recent relevant models. This suggested that our technique could gain surperior spatio-temporal activity representation learning capability in Euclidean and non-Euclidean space based on the limited sample data than the compared models. Our study may provide an effective technical solution for HAR wuth high quality.

AB Identification of rockmass class before construction is crucial to the safe and high-efficiency building of underground tunnels and has been a challenge for long water diversion tunnels. This paper is devoted to developing the LightGBM-based strategy for on-site rockmass class prediction in long tunnels from TBM construction data. The LightGBM-based strategy optimizes the input features and hyperparameters automatically by combining the tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and establishes rockmass prediction models with data of various structures in 7505 TBM tunneling cycles in the Yinsong tunnel of 17.488 km long. The LightGBM-based strategy has an accuracy of 92% on the testing set, outperforms the random forest and support vector machines on the Yinsong tunnel data, and shows good generalization ability in the TBM7 tunnel in Xingjiang. The work contributes to the intelligent and efficient construction of long TBM tunnels.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB Recently, pipeline parallelism for large-scale Deep Neural Network (DNN) training has been developed, which partitions the DNN model across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs) and improves the training efficiency by processing data divided into minibatches as a pipeline. However, existing model partitioning algorithms are mostly designed for homogeneous clusters with the same GPU devices and network connections (e.g., bandwidths), while heterogeneous GPU clusters are widely used in mainstream computing infrastructures. In heterogeneous environment, devices are equipped with different GPUs and network connections, and the efficiency of previous approaches is unsatisfactory due to the unbalanced load of the pipeline stages. In this paper, we propose PipePar, a model partitioning and task placement algorithm for pipeline parallel DNN training in heterogeneous GPU clusters. PipePar is based on dynamic programming with search space pruning that takes into consideration both the heterogeneity of GPUs and network bandwidth. PipePar can profile the DNN model for each type of GPU and conduct model partitioning and task placement based on given GPUs and network connections, which can optimize pipeline load balancing in heterogeneous environments and thus improve training efficiency. We design and implement a pipeline-based distributed deep learning training system in a heterogeneous GPU cluster and show through extensive experiments that PipePar outperforms the baseline approaches in the speed of large-scale DNN training.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION; BIOMARKERS; MODELS
AB Survival models exist to study relationships between biomarkers and treatment effects. Deep learning-powered survival models supersede the classical Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model, but substantial performance drops were observed on high-dimensional features because of irrelevant/redundant information. To fill this gap, we proposed SwarmDeepSurv by integrating swarm intelligence algorithms with the deep survival model. Furthermore, four objective functions were designed to optimize prognostic prediction while regularizing selected feature numbers. When testing on multicenter sets (n = 1,058) of four different cancer types, SwarmDeepSurv was less prone to overfitting and achieved optimal patient risk stratification compared with popular survival modeling algorithms. Strikingly, SwarmDeepSurv selected different features compared with classical feature selection algorithms, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), with nearly no feature overlapping across these models. Taken together, SwarmDeepSurv offers an alternative approach to model relationships between radiomics features and survival endpoints, which can further extend to study other input data types including genomics.

TI Transcriptomic forecasting with neural ordinary differential equations
SO PATTERNS
LA English
DT Article
AB Single-cell transcriptomics technologies can uncover changes in the molecular states that underlie cellular phenotypes. However, understanding the dynamic cellular processes requires extending from inferring trajectories from snapshots of cellular states to estimating temporal changes in cellular gene expression. To address this challenge, we have developed a neural ordinary differential-equation-based method, RNAForecaster, for predicting gene expression states in single cells for multiple future time steps in an embedding-independent manner. We demonstrate that RNAForecaster can accurately predict future expres-sion states in simulated single-cell transcriptomic data with cellular tracking over time. We then show that by using metabolic labeling single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from constitutively dividing cells, RNAForecaster accurately recapitulates many of the expected changes in gene expression during progres-sion through the cell cycle over a 3-day period. Thus, RNAForecaster enables short-term estimation of future expression states in biological systems from high-throughput datasets with temporal information.

AB We identified mortality-, age-, and sex-associated differences in relation to reference intervals (RIs) for laboratory tests in population-wide data from nearly 2 million hospital patients in Denmark and comprising more than 300 million measurements. A low-parameter mathematical wave-based modification method was developed to adjust for dietary and environment influences during the year. The resulting mathematical fit allowed for improved association rates between re-classified abnormal laboratory tests, patient diagnoses, and mortality. The study highlights the need for seasonally modified RIs and presents an approach that has the potential to reduce over-and underdiagnosis, affecting both physician-patient interactions and electronic health record research as a whole.

TI AI systems must not confuse users about their sentience or moral status
SO PATTERNS
LA English
DT Article
AB One relatively neglected challenge in ethical artificial intelligence (AI) design is ensuring that AI systems invite a degree of emotional and moral concern appropriate to their moral standing. Although experts generally agree that current AI chatbots are not sentient to any meaningful degree, these systems can already provoke substantial attachment and sometimes intense emotional responses in users. Furthermore, rapid advances in AI technology could soon create AIs of plausibly debatable sentience and moral standing, at least by some relevant definitions. Morally confusing AI systems create unfortunate ethical dilemmas for the owners and users of those systems, since it is unclear how those systems ethically should be treated. I argue here that, to the extent possible, we should avoid creating AI systems whose sentience or moral standing is unclear and that AI systems should be designed so as to invite appropriate emotional responses in ordinary users.

AB Ther e has been a rise in natural language processing (NLP) communities across the African continent (Masa-khane , AfricaNLP workshops). With this momentum noted , and given the existing power asymmetries that plague the African continent , there is an urgent need to ensure that these technologies move toward shared goals between organizations and stakeholder s , not only to improve the representation of African languages in cutting-edge NLP research but also to ensure that NLP research enables technological advances toward human dignity, well-being, and equity for those who speak African languages. This study investigates the mo-tivations, focus, and challenges faced by various stakeholder s who ar e at the core of the NLP process. We perform structured stakeholder identification to identify core stakeholder s in the NLP process. Interviews with representatives of these stakeholder groups are performed and are collated into relevant themes. Finally, a set of recommendations are proposed for use by policy and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers.

ID ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; ARCHIVE; TCDD
AB Single-cell sequencing reveals the heterogeneity of cellular response to chemical perturbations. However, testing all relevant combinations of cell types, chemicals, and doses is a daunting task. A deep generative learning formalism called variational autoencoders (VAEs) has been effective in predicting single-cell gene expression perturbations for single doses. Here, we introduce single-cell variational inference of dose -response (scVIDR), a VAE-based model that predicts both single-dose and multiple-dose cellular responses better than existing models. We show that scVIDR can predict dose-dependent gene expression across mouse hepatocytes, human blood cells, and cancer cell lines. We biologically interpret the latent space of scVIDR using a regression model and use scVIDR to order individual cells based on their sensitivity to chem-ical perturbation by assigning each cell a "pseudo-dose"value. We envision that scVIDR can help reduce the need for repeated animal testing across tissues, chemicals, and doses.

AB We have developed a machine learning (ML) approach using Gaussian process (GP)-based spatial covari-ance (SCV) to track the impact of spatial-temporal mutational events driving host-pathogen balance in biology. We show how SCV can be applied to understanding the response of evolving covariant relationships linking the variant pattern of virus spread to pathology for the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome on a daily basis. We show that GP-based SCV relationships in conjunction with genome-wide co-occurrence analysis provides an early warning anomaly detection (EWAD) system for the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). EWAD can anticipate changes in the pattern of performance of spread and pathology weeks in advance, identifying sig-natures destined to become VOCs. GP-based analyses of variation across entire viral genomes can be used to monitor micro and macro features responsible for host-pathogen balance. The versatility of GP-based SCV defines starting point for understanding nature's evolutionary path to complexity through natural selection.

AB The true accuracy of a machine-learning model is a population-level statistic that cannot be observed directly. In practice, predictor performance is estimated against one or more test datasets, and the accuracy of this estimate strongly depends on how well the test sets represent all possible unseen datasets. Here we describe paired evaluation as a simple, robust approach for evaluating performance of machine-learning models in small-sample biological and clinical studies. We use the method to evaluate predictors of drug response in breast cancer cell lines and of disease severity in patients with Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating that the choice of test data can cause estimates of performance to vary by as much as 20%. We show that paired evaluation makes it possible to identify outliers, improve the accuracy of performance estimates in the presence of known confounders, and assign statistical significance when comparing machine learning models.

AB Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data can reveal novel insights into the heterogeneity of complex biological systems. Many tools and workflows have been developed to perform different types of analyses. However, these tools are spread across different packages or programming environments, rely on different underlying data structures, and can only be utilized by people with knowledge of programming languages. In the Single-Cell Toolkit 2 (SCTK2), we have integrated a variety of popular tools and workflows to perform various aspects of scRNA-seq analysis. All tools and workflows can be run in the R console or using an intuitive graphical user interface built with R/Shiny. HTML reports generated with Rmarkdown can be used to document and recapitulate individual steps or entire analysis workflows. We show that the toolkit offers more features when compared with existing tools and allows for a seamless analysis of scRNA-seq data for non-computational users.

AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as a promising computational framework for integrating insights from the brain into artificial intelligence (AI). Existing software infrastructures based on SNNs exclusively support brain simulation or brain-inspired AI, but not both simultaneously. To decode the nature of biological intelligence and create AI, we present the brain-inspired cognitive intelligence engine (BrainCog). This SNN-based platform provides essential infrastructure support for developing brain-inspired AI and brain simulation. BrainCog integrates different biological neurons, encoding strategies, learning rules, brain areas, and hardware-software co-design as essential components. Leveraging these user-friendly components, BrainCog incorporates various cognitive functions, including perception and learning, decision-making, knowledge representation and reasoning, motor control, social cognition, and brain structure and function simulations across multiple scales. BORN is an AI engine developed by BrainCog, showcasing seamless integration of BrainCog's components and cognitive functions to build advanced AI models and applications.

SO PATTERNS

ID NEURONS
AB During dynamic social interaction, inferring and predicting others' behaviors through theory of mind (ToM) is crucial for obtaining benefits in cooperative and competitive tasks. Current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods primarily rely on agent observations to select behaviors, but they lack inspiration from ToM, which limits performance. In this article, we propose a multi-agent ToM decision-making (MAToMDM) model, which consists of a MAToM spiking neural network (MAToM-SNN) module and a decision -making module. We design two brain-inspired ToM modules (Self-MAToM and Other-MAToM) to predict others' behaviors based on self-experience and observations of others, respectively. Each agent can adjust its behavior according to the predicted actions of others. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated through experiments conducted in cooperative and competitive tasks. The results indicate that integrating the ToM mechanism can enhance cooperation and competition efficiency and lead to higher rewards compared with traditional MARL models.

AB This paper aims to study the Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking algorithm of noncooperative game with second-order system under strongly connected digraph. In the algorithm, velocity information is not directly accessible to players, in order to avoid the need for additional velocity observers. Meanwhile, for position information, the position estimation of all the other players under local communication is completed in fixed time. To address the aforementioned concern, a NE seeking algorithm with a two-time-scale structure is designed. (1) For reduced system, a second-order velocity estimation model based on state observer is introduced to avoid direct acquisition of velocity information; (2) For fast compensation mechanism, each player uses leader-following consensus protocol to estimate the position of all the other players. The fixed-time consensus protocol is utilized to ensure that the position is estimated in fixed time. Then, aiming to reduce the communication costs and communication burden among players, the event-triggered mechanism is introduced into the above algorithm, and Zeno behavior is excluded. Lastly, a self-organized network problem involving autonomous vehicles is presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed theoretical results.

AB During an epidemic, accurate human temperature screening based on neural networks for disease surveillance is important and challenging. Existing distant human forehead temperature measuring device usually adopts a dual-camera system using paired RGB and thermal infrared images to conduct face detection and temperature measurement. Since the facial RGB image may undermine people's privacy, we designed a monocular thermal system and proposed an effective framework called the InfraNet to measure and calibrate forehead temperature of people in the wild. To address the challenge of temperature floating, the InfraNet calibrates the subject's temperature with one's physical depth and horizontal offset predicted by a single infrared image. Our InfraNet framework mainly consists of three parts: face detection subnet, depth and horizontal offset estimation subnet and temperature calibration subnet. The temperature calibration performance can be improved with the help of spatial regularization term concentrating on predicting precise depth and horizontal offset of people. Besides, we collected a large-scale infrared image dataset in the both lab and wild scenarios, including 8,215 thermal infrared images. Experiments on our wild dataset demonstrated that the InfraNet achieved 91.6% high accuracy of distant multi-subject temperature measurement on average under the standard temperature threshold of strict 0.3 degrees C.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heterogeneous data is common in many real-world machine learning applications, such as healthcare, market analysis, environmental sciences, and social media analysis. In these domains, data is often represented in different modalities and, most of the time, in non-vectorial formats, like text, images, and video. Traditional machine learning algorithms are often limited in their ability to effectively analyze and learn from such diverse data types. In this paper, we propose two approaches for such heterogeneous data analysis: static and adaptive subspace kernel fusion. The first approach is a kernel-based method extracting the essential parts of the subspace of each input modality and creating one single fused representation of the data. The second approach utilizes an adaptation step by integrating the weighting of spectral properties into the fusion process in order to improve the data's representation with respect to a given classification task. Our proposed methods are evaluated on several multi-modal, heterogeneous data sets and demonstrate significant performance improvement compared to other methods in the field. Our results highlight the importance of fusing the underlying subspace information of heterogeneous data for achieving superior performance in machine learning tasks.

AB In this research, a partial least squares (PLS)-based RF with hybrid feature subspace selection is proposed for regression problems. For the problem that average voting strategy of basic RF may decrease method accuracy, PLS is adopted to automatically assign a voting weight to each tree and aggregate the outputs of all trees. To improve feature subspace selection, stratified sampling and embedded feature selection are integrated. First, the variable importance (VI) of each input feature is obtained through embedded feature selection and the features are categorized into two disjointed sets according to VI. During the construction of the trees, stratified sampling is used for feature subspace selection. The effectiveness of PLS aggregation and hybrid feature selection is respectively validated on six regression datasets. The superiority of the proposed RF is demonstrated on historical operation datasets of two power plants through a comparison with five other models.

AB In this research paper, we present a sensitivity analysis of parameters utilized in an agent-based model for crowd simulations. The model is made up of two types of agents that explore a virtual environment to reach an exit from a specified starting point. They behave differently depending on their type, and they may be collaborative, acting carefully to help others reach the exit, or defectors, acting independently and wildly. To simulate the agents' and environment dynamics we used the Ant Colony Optimization algorithm principles. Three metrics to evaluate the effects of these behaviors have been used: the number of exited agents, the path cost, and the exit time. Furthermore, two different types of analyses have been carried out and are presented: group analysis, in which the performance of the groups into which the agents are split are compared; and types' analysis, where the performance of the two types of agents, i.e., collaborators and defectors, are investigated and compared.

TI A Fast Granular-Ball-Based Density Peaks Clustering Algorithm for
   Large-Scale Data

AB Density peaks clustering algorithm (DP) has difficulty in clustering large-scale data, because it requires the distance matrix to compute the density and d-distance for each object, which has O(n(2)) time complexity. Granular ball (GB) is a coarse-grained representation of data. It is based on the fact that an object and its local neighbors have similar distribution and they have high possibility of belonging to the same class. It has been introduced into supervised learning by Xia et al. to improve the efficiency of supervised learning, such as support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor classification, rough set, etc. Inspired by the idea of GB, we introduce it into unsupervised learning for the first time and propose a GB-based DP algorithm, called GB-DP. First, it generates GBs from the original data with an unsupervised partitioning method. Then, it defines the density of GBs, instead of the density of objects, according to the centers, radius, and distances between its members and centers, without setting any parameters. After that, it computes the distance between the centers of GBs as the distance between GBs and defines the delta-distance of GBs. Finally, it uses GBs ' density and delta-distance to plot the decision graph, employs DP algorithm to cluster them, and expands the clustering result to the original data. Since there is no need to calculate the distance between any two objects and the number of GBs is far less than the scale of a data, it greatly reduces the running time of DP algorithm. By comparing with k-means, ball k-means, DP, DPC-KNN-PCA, FastDPeak, and DLORE-DP, GB-DP can get similar or even better clustering results in much less running time without setting any parameters.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB A memory mechanism has attracted growing popularity in tracking tasks due to the ability of learning long-term-dependent information. However, it is very challenging for existing memory modules to provide the intrinsic attribute information of the target to the tracker in complex scenes. In this article, by considering the biological visual memory mechanisms, we propose the novel online tracking method via an attention-driven memory network, which can mine discriminative memory information and enhance the robustness and reliability of the tracker. First, to reinforce effectiveness of memory content, we design a novel attention-driven memory network. In the network, the long memory module gains property-level memory information by focusing on the state of the target at both the channel and spatial levels. Meanwhile, in reciprocity, we add a short-term memory module to maintain good adaptability when confronting drastic deformation of the target. The attention-driven memory network can adaptively adjust the contribution of short-term and long-term memories to tracking results under the weighted gradient harmonized loss. On this basis, to avoid model performance degradation, an online memory updater (MU) is further proposed. It is designed to mining for target information in tracking results through the Mixer layer and the online head network together. By evaluating the confidence of the tracking results, the memory updater can accurately judge the time of updating the model, which guarantees the effectiveness of online memory updates. Finally, the proposed method performs favorably and has been extensively validated on several benchmark datasets, including object tracking benchmark-50/100 (OTB-50/100), temple color-128 (TC-128), unmanned aerial vehicles-123 (UAV-123), generic object tracking -10k (GOT-10k), visual object tracking-2016 (VOT-2016), and VOT-2018 against several advanced methods.

AB It is an interesting open problem to enable robots to efficiently and effectively learn long-horizon manipulation skills. Motivated to augment robot learning via more effective exploration, this work develops task-driven reinforcement learning with action primitives (TRAPs), a new manipulation skill learning framework that augments standard reinforcement learning algorithms with formal methods and parameterized action space (PAS). In particular, TRAPs uses linear temporal logic (LTL) to specify complex manipulation skills. LTL progression, a semantics-preserving rewriting operation, is then used to decompose the training task at an abstract level, informs the robot about their current task progress, and guides them via reward functions. The PAS, a predefined library of heterogeneous action primitives, further improves the efficiency of robot exploration. We highlight that TRAPs augments the learning of manipulation skills in both learning efficiency and effectiveness (i.e., task constraints). Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that TRAPs outperforms most existing methods.Sign

AB Zeroing neural network (ZNN) has been applied to various time-varying problems solving, and numerous ZNN models have been developed in recent years, such as power-type varying-parameter ZNN (PT-VR-ZNN) for solving time-varying quadratic minimization problems, adaptive fuzzy-type ZNN (AFT-ZNN) for solving time-variant matrix inversion and fuzzy power ZNN (FPZNN) for solving time-varying quadratic programming problems. As a time-varying problem and imperative research hot spot in science and engineering, the synchronization of chaotic systems has developed for decades. However, the research on chaos synchronization using ZNN method is rarely reported. Therefore, this paper proposes a time-varying fuzzy parameter ZNN (TVFP-ZNN) model to realize chaotic systems synchronization against the external noises. The most prominent feature of the TVFP- ZNN model is that the time-varying fuzzy parameter generated by the fuzzy logic system is applied in this model. Moreover, the above mentioned three models are also applied to realize the same chaotic systems synchronization for comparison. Compared with above three models, the proposed TVFP-ZNN model not only possesses the fastest convergence speed, but also maintains strongest robustness to noises. Besides, the excellent performances of the TVFP-ZNN model are verified by rigorous mathematical validation. Furthermore, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed TVFP-ZNN model for chaotic systems synchronization are verified by comparative numerical simulation results. Finally, the process of the proposed TVFP-ZNN model for chaotic system synchronization is displayed on the oscilloscope based on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) to further illustrate its practical application ability.

AB Recently, many researchers have applied Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to multi-label learning tasks by establishing relations among labels. However, these researchers have only used GCN as an auxiliary module and have lacked exploration of object relations, which has limited the inference capability of GCN. Applying GCN to multi-label classification in information systems poses significant challenges to address because information systems are considered as a graph with only nodes and no edges. This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems. The effectiveness and significance of performance of MG-GCN has been verified through ranking-based indicators and hypothesis tests, respectively.

AB When the first transformer-based language models were published in the late 2010s, pretraining with general text and then fine-tuning the model on a task-specific dataset often achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, more recent work suggests that for some tasks, directly prompting the pretrained model matches or surpasses fine-tuning in performance with few or no model parameter updates required. The use of prompts with language models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks is known as prompt learning. We investigated the viability of prompt learning on clinically meaningful decision tasks and directly compared this with more traditional fine-tuning methods. Results show that prompt learning methods were able to match or surpass the performance of traditional fine-tuning with up to 1000 times fewer trainable parameters, less training time, less training data, and lower computation resource requirements. We argue that these characteristics make prompt learning a very desirable alternative to traditional fine-tuning for clinical tasks, where the computational resources of public health providers are limited, and where data can often not be made available or not be used for fine-tuning due to patient privacy concerns. The complementary code to reproduce the experiments presented in this work can be found at https://github.com/NtaylorOX/Public_Clinical_Prompt.

AB Text attribute person search aims to identify the particular pedestrian by textual attribute information. Compared to person re-identification tasks which requires imagery samples as its query, text attribute person search is more useful under the circumstance where only witness is available. Most existing text attribute person search methods focus on improving the matching correlation and alignments by learning better representations of person-attribute instance pairs, with few consideration of the latent correlations between attributes. In this work, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) and pseudo-label-based text attribute person search method. Concretely, the model directly constructs the attribute correlations by label co-occurrence probability, in which the nodes are represented by attribute embedding and edges are by the filtered correlation matrix of attribute labels. In order to obtain better representations, we combine the cross-attention module (CAM) and the GCN. Furthermore, to address the unseen attribute relationships, we update the edge information through the instances through testing set with high predicted probability thus to better adapt the attribute distribution. Extensive experiments illustrate that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on publicly available person search benchmarks: Market-1501 and PETA.

TI Improving Robustness of Intent Detection Under Adversarial Attacks: A
   Geometric Constraint Perspective
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Dialog system; representation learning; robustness
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs)-based natural language processing (NLP) systems are vulnerable to being fooled by adversarial examples presented in recent studies. Intent detection tasks in dialog systems are no exception, however, relatively few works have been attempted on the defense side. The combination of linear classifier and softmax is widely used in most defense methods for other NLP tasks. Unfortunately, it does not encourage the model to learn well-separated feature representations. Thus, it is easy to induce adversarial examples. In this article, we propose a simple, yet efficient defense method from the geometric constraint perspective. Specifically, we first propose an M-similarity metric to shrink variances of intraclass features. Intuitively, better geometric conditions of feature space can bring lower misclassification probability (MP). Therefore, we derive the optimal geometric constraints of anchors within each category from the overall MP (OMP) with theoretical guarantees. Due to the nonconvex characteristic of the optimal geometric condition, it is hard to satisfy the traditional optimization process. To this end, we regard such geometric constraints as manifold optimization processes in the Stiefel manifold, thus naturally avoiding the above challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve robustness compared with baselines, while retaining the excellent performance on normal examples.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in urban target-tracking tasks, where long-term tracking of evasive targets is of great significance for public safety. However, the tracked targets are easily lost due to the evasive behavior of the targets and the unstructured characteristics of the urban environment. To address this issue, this article proposes a hybrid target-tracking approach based on target intention inference and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First, a target intention inference model based on convolution neural networks (CNNs) is built to infer target intentions by fusing urban environment information and observed target trajectory. Then, the prediction of the target trajectory can be inspired by the inferred target intentions, which can further provide effective guidance to the target search process. In order to fully explore the policy space, the target search policy is developed under a DRL framework, where the search policy is modeled as a deep neural network (DNN) and trained by interacting with the task environment. The simulation results show that the inference of the target intentions can effectively guide the UAV to search for the target and significantly improve the target-tracking performance. Meanwhile, the generalization results indicate that the proposed DRL-based search policy has high robustness to the uncertainty of the target behavior.

AB With the continuous development of civil aviation industry in recent years, the demand for flight training has been increasing and the flight training safety requirements have been improving. To address the problem that the mining of flight training data is not deep enough and the research of flight training data is delayed, the study proposes a flight training data prediction model based on incremental learning to achieve real-time flight training data prediction and ensure flight training safety. The model firstly uses a small amount of data to generate a base model; secondly, on this base model, a specific amount of data is input to the model for learning according to a certain time frequency to continuously optimize the base model; finally, the model is compared with several models for experiments. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional model, the model has high prediction accuracy and good real-time performance in flight training data prediction, which can better ensure flight training safety.

AB High average utility itemset mining(HAUIM), a fairer pattern mining method, discovers the itemsets through the utility value and length of itemset. Nevertheless, it is difficult for users to set a optimal average-utility threshold in traditional HAUIM problem. By combining the advantages of the HAUIM and Top-k method, users don't constantly try the appropriate threshold value, the top-k HAUIM could output k itemsets with the highest average-utility. In this paper, a list-based One-Phase algorithm called List-based mining top-K high average-utility itemset(LMTKAI) is proposed to solve the top-k high average-utility itemsets mining problem. LMTKAI decreases the estimated utilities of itemsets with two tighter average-utility upper-bound named tmaub and mrau. Moreover, EA(Early Abandoning) strategy is employed to reduce the number of costly join operation and LEMUP(Local Estimated Maximum Utility Pruning) strategy is designed to avoid extra calculation of mrau. LMTKAI also incorporates four threshold strategies named RIU(Real Item Utility), CAD(Co-occurrence Average-utility Descending order), PCATD(Part Co-occurrence Average-utility of Triplets of items Descending order) and EPBF(Exploring the most Promising Branches First) to effectively raise the minimum threshold. Extensive experiments were performed on various datasets to test the performance of proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that LMTKAI has better performance than existing algorithms.

AB Multi-hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) aims to reason answers through multiple triples in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Unfortunately, in practice due to the rapid growth of information, KGs are often incomplete with missing relations, increasing the difficulty of reasoning for multi-hop KGQA. Most prior works utilize auxiliary text corpus enhancement to tackle the challenge of incomplete KG. However, they fail to consider the fine-grained semantic structure contained in texts, which would be critical to reveal the missing relations of KGs. Meanwhile, they ignore semantic associations among multiple texts, leading to the blocking of the reasoning process along texts. To address these problems, we present the idea of extracting question-candidate evidences and parsing them into Abstract Conceptual Evidences (ACEs) to explicitly capture fine-grained semantic information. Accordingly, we propose an Abstract Conceptual Evidence Reasoning (ACER) model, exploiting the semantic associations among ACEs to form multi-hop evidence reasoning paths from the question to candidate answers. Moreover, a Statement-Evidence Reasoning method is introduced to further aggregate evidences and a joint entity scoring method for answer selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the ACER by its outperformance on different extents of KG incompleteness, as well as its interpretability of the answer reasoning process.

AB The width spread is one of the key indices affecting hot rolling processes and product quality. The traditional Shibahara spread prediction model (SSM) does not take into account the wear and interference of production equipment. As a result, the prediction accuracy cannot satisfy the high precision and high reliability requirements. To improve the prediction accuracy, first, this paper analyzes the strip deformation mechanism and the source of prediction errors and proposes an improved Shibahara spread model (ISSM) based on wear and interference. Second, a Bayesian-optimized differential evolution and adaptive gradient descent (BDE-AGD) algorithm is proposed for ISSM parameter optimization. This algorithm adopts the Bayesian algorithm to optimize the differential evolution (BDE) algorithm in stage 1, which improves the global search ability. Furthermore, the adaptive strategy is used for gradient descent (AGD) to improve the local search capability in stage 2. Finally, the experimental results show that the BDE-AGD algorithm reduces the error by 21.9% and 3.1% compared with DE-AGD and BDE-GD, respectively. This shows that BDE-AGD has a better global optimization capability. In addition, the prediction precision of ISSM is improved by 9.77% compared with the traditional SSM. Moreover, the precision of ISSM is improved by 8.56% on average compared with seven machine learning algorithms. This shows that ISSM optimized by BDE-AGD can achieve high-precision prediction of strip spread.

ID NETWORK
AB One-shot semantic segmentation approaches aim to learn a meta-learning framework from seen classes with annotated samples, which can be applied in novel classes with only one annotated sample. However, most existing works still face the challenge of reduced generalization capability on novel classes due to two reasons: utilizing only foreground and background prototypes generated from support samples may lead to semantic bias from the model's perspective, and negative support-query pairs may result in spatial inconsistency from the data's perspective. To alleviate the semantic bias problem, we propose a multi-view prototype learning paradigm to reduce the appearance discrepancy between support and query images. In addition to the classical foreground and background prototypes, the multi-view prototypes include support outline view, query foreground view, seen class object view and natural background view prototypes. These proposed prototypes provide more refined semantic support information. To reduce the impact of negative samples, we propose a novel inference paradigm (n-iteration inference) for producing pseudo labels of novel classes as augmented support samples. These samples are then applied in the proposed multi-view prototype method for one-shot semantic segmentation. Experimental results show that we have achieved new state-of-the-art performance on the two standard datasets, PASCAL-5(i) and COCO-20(i). Furthermore, we apply the inference paradigm to other classical works in order to enhance the performance of one-shot semantic segmentation.

AB Accurate detection of pedestrian lanes is a crucial criterion for vision-impaired people to navigate freely and safely. The current deep learning methods have achieved reasonable accuracy at this task. However, they lack practicality for real-time pedestrian lane detection due to non-optimal accuracy, speed, and model size trade-off. Hence, an optimized deep neural network (DNN) for pedestrian lane detection is required. Designing a DNN from scratch is a laborious task that requires significant experience and time. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm, named MSD-NAS, to automate this laborious task. The proposed method designs an optimized deep network with multi-scale input branches, allowing the derived network to utilize local and global contexts for predictions. The search is also performed in a large and generic space that includes many existing hand-designed network architectures as candidates. To further boost performance, we propose a Short-term Visual Memory mechanism to improve information facilitation within the derived networks. Evaluated on the PLVP3 dataset of 10,000 images, the DNN designed by MSD-NAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (0.9781) and mIoU (0.9542), while being 20.16 times faster and 2.56 times smaller than the current best deep learning model.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DE Depth; Dynamic environments; Objects interaction; Semantic segmentation;
   Visual SLAM
ID VERSATILE
AB Nowadays, modern visual SLAM methods attempt to deal with dynamic environments by considering the non-rigid scene assumption. This well-established approach combines geometric and semantic information to detect dynamic objects to achieve accurate localization and mapping in real environments. However, these methods need more generalization and scene awareness because of their reasoning limits due to the labeling object strategy and the need for matched keypoints. Therefore, we propose a novel method called Depth Attention Module SLAM (DAM-SLAM) that overcomes the limitations of existing methods. The main idea is to take into account the depth influence used in the geometric and semantic modules through a depth-related adaptive threshold and impact factor. Moreover, a Bayesian filter is used to refine the keypoints state estimates using a motion probability update function based on a weighting strategy related to the keypoints area (in/out of segmented object's masks). In addition, we designed a Depth Attention Module that allows generalization to other methods by considering the non-matched keypoints and the keypoints out of segmented regions. This module estimates these keypoints state without requiring any prior semantic information by determining the interactions between the objects. We estimate this interaction through the correlation between the proximity of depth and position of these keypoints with the dynamic keypoints in a specific zone of influence of dynamic objects. The obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in providing accurate localization and mapping in dynamic environments.

AB Matrix decomposition is a widely used tool in machine learning with many applications such as dimension reduction or visualization. In this paper we consider decomposing X, a matrix of size n x m, to a product WS where we require that S, a matrix of size n x k, needs to have consecutive ones property. More specifically, we require that each row of S needs to be in the form of 0,., 0, 1,., 1, 0,., 0. Such decompositions are particularly meaningful if X is a matrix where each row represents a time series; in such a case the ones in each row in S represent a time segment. We show that the optimization problem is inapproximable. To solve the problem we propose 5 different algorithms. The first two algorithms are based on solving iteratively S while keeping W fixed and then solving W while keeping S fixed. The next two algorithms are based on greedily optimizing a single row in S and the corresponding column in W. The last algorithm first finds the optimal decomposition of with 2k - 1 non-overlapping rows, and then greedily combines the rows until k rows remain. We compare the algorithms experimentally, focusing on the quality of the decomposition as well as the computational time. We show experimentally that our algorithms yield interpretable results in practical time.

DE Active learning; Self-training; Graph Neural Networks
AB In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called STAL, which makes use of unlabeled graph data, through a combination of Active Learning and Self-Training, in order to improve node labeling by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs have been shown to perform well on many tasks, when sufficient labeled data are available. Such data, however, is often scarce, leading to the need for methods that leverage unlabeled data that are abundant. Active Learning and Self-training are two common approaches towards this goal and we investigate here their combination, in the context of GNN training. Specifically, we propose a new framework that first uses active learning to select highly uncertain unlabeled nodes to be labeled and be included in the training set. In each iteration of active labeling, the proposed method expands also the label set through self-training. In particular, highly certain pseudo-labels are obtained and added automatically to the training set. This process is repeated, leading to good classifiers, with a limited amount of labeled data. Our experimental results on various datasets confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach.

AB Precision agriculture refers to the use of advanced technologies and data analytics to optimize farming practices, maximize crop yields, and reduce resource wastage. In precision agriculture monitoring, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a valuable tool for large-scale implementation. The selection of suitable UAVs is a critical aspect of precision agriculture and is deliberated as significant multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. In decision issues, the evaluation of experts about any available options plays an important role. In this context, interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (IVq-ROFS) is a useful tool allowing experts to provide their evaluations in a wider space and better deal with incomplete information. This paper aims to develop a new approach to determining expert weights using distance and similarity measures for interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (IVq-ROFNs). To achieve this, an average group assessment based on individual assessments is constructed. The experts' weights were then established by computing similarity measures between the individual evaluations and the average group assessment. Moreover, the technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is extended to address the MAGDM problem under IVq-ROF information. An example involving UAV selection for precision agriculture is provided to demonstrate the validity of the suggested method, and the impact of parameters on decision results is discussed. Finally, a comparative analysis with existing approaches demonstrates the superiority and advantages of the proposed technique.

AB The probabilistic rough set (PRS) model, through the incorporation of error levels, represents a quantitative extension of the classical rough set model. It serves as a fundamental expansion that enables robust fault tolerance capabilities by employing relative quantitative description. However, when confronted with interval-valued fuzzy data, the PRS model is rendered ineffective. The primary reason for this lies in the absence of a unique equivalence relation in interval-valued decision systems. This paper presents a novel approach to address this limitation. In this paper, we first propose a fuzzy similarity relation based on diversity function, which establishes a viable foundation for constricting models of probabilistic rough fuzzy set and multi-granularity probabilistic rough set models for interval-valued fuzzy decision systems. Then the decision rules are derived from the presented three kinds of multi-granularity probabilistic rough fuzzy sets, respectively. In order to elucidate the concepts of interval-valued probabilistic rough fuzzy sets and multi-granularity probabilistic rough fuzzy sets, a case study is considered, which is helpful for applying these theories to deal with practical issues.

TI Novel Fuzzy Correlation Coefficient and Variable Selection Method for
   Fuzzy Regression Analysis Based on Distance Approach

AB data analysis, analyzing the relationships between the variables such as correlation analysis and regression analysis are very important. Correlation analysis and regression analysis are not only very important in analyzing the influence relationship and causal relationship of variables but also serve as the basis for statistical analysis. Furthermore, they are essential and important as basic analysis for machine learning analysis such as deep learning. This is because in analyzing the input and output in deep learning, variables with high correlation are selected first, and in analyzing the causal relationship, it is basic to first conduct basic analysis such as regression analysis. Especially, when data are observed as fuzzy data with ambiguous information, it is difficult to propose unique methods for those analyses due to its complexity. However, the application of fuzzy theory to correlation analysis for data with such ambiguous information has not been an effective study, and several studies have been conducted in cases where the data is not general fuzzy data or interval estimation. As a result, the effectiveness of the fuzzy theory was not highlighted. In particular, the variable selection method for selecting important variables in multiple regression analysis is a very important and essential process in regression analysis. A variable that is significant in simple regression analysis may not be significant in multiple regression analysis due to its relationship with other variables. Therefore, not all variables that affect the dependent variable can be used as independent variables in multiple regression analysis. Therefore, multiple regression analysis goes through the process of excluding some variables. But until now, the process of fuzzy multiple regression analysis has not been applied without a variable selection method and the significance of important variables has not been emphasized that much. In this paper, a fuzzy correlation coefficient and multiple fuzzy regression analysis using variable section method are proposed. For this, first defuzzification and fuzzy ordering are defined. And then fuzzy correlation coefficient is proposed using L2 distance. Next, fuzzy sum of squares are defined for F-statistics to test the significance of the regression model. Using this F-statistics, fuzzy R2, and fuzzy RMSE, several variable selection methods are proposed based on distance approach. For the data analysis, foreign exchange reserve data and house price of South Korea have been applied which are important indicators for economic crisis. The financial data is mostly recorded as closing values, but the closing values cannot be the representative of the given period of time. Therefore, we can deal with the financial data as fuzzy data which have some fluctuation that can be considered as vagueness that the data originally include. We have used foreign exchange reserve data and house price data with several financial variables. And the proposed fuzzy correlation coefficient and variable selection for fuzzy regression analysis are applied to these financial data.

AB Mounting evidence shows that Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests the dysfunction of the brain network much earlier before the onset of clinical symptoms, making its early diagnosis possible. Current brain network analyses treat high-dimensional network data as a regular matrix or vector, which destroys the essential network topology, thereby seriously affecting diagnosis accuracy. In this context, harmonic waves provide a solid theoretical background for exploring brain network topology. However, the harmonic waves are originally intended to discover neurological disease propagation patterns in the brain, which makes it difficult to accommodate brain disease diagnosis with high heterogeneity. To address this challenge, this article proposes a network manifold harmonic discriminant analysis (MHDA) method for accurately detecting AD. Each brain network is regarded as an instance drawn on a Stiefel manifold. Every instance is represented by a set of orthonormal eigenvectors (i.e., harmonic waves) derived from its Laplacian matrix, which fully respects the topological structure of the brain network. An MHDA method within the Stiefel space is proposed to identify the group-dependent common harmonic waves, which can be used as group-specific references for downstream analyses. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in stratifying cognitively normal (CN) controls, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD.

AB Metaphors are figurative expressions frequently appearing daily. Given its significance in downstream natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and sentiment analysis, computational metaphor processing has led to an upsurge in the community. The progress of Artificial Intelligence has incentivized several technological tools and frameworks in this domain. This article aims to comprehensively summarize and categorize previous computational metaphor processing approaches regarding metaphor identification, interpretation, generation, and application. Though studies on metaphor identification have made significant progress, metaphor understanding, conceptual metaphor processing, and metaphor generation still need in-depth analysis. We hope to identify future directions for prospective researchers based on comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the previous works.

AB Due to the limited signal acquisition conditions in the marine environment, it is difficult to repeatedly sample the same target and obtain samples with high quality. Therefore, the denoising algorithm based on self-supervised method is the most commonly used approach. In this paper, we propose a prior based denoising network (PriorDeNet), which is a two-stage model for denoising a single noisy sample without ground truth. In the first stage, the potential statistical prior is obtained by the proposed model structure, so that the signal and noise in the sample can have different fitting speeds, and the application of tricks such as dropout significantly improves the prior. Consequently, the single-sample problem can be transformed into a multi-sample problem. In the second stage, a denoising model that only uses noisy samples is constructed, which uses intermediate outputs generated in the first stage to obtain the denoised sample, and designs a loss function based on the coefficient of variation to match their features. Through the tests on real-world and synthetic samples with different signal-to-noise ratios, we can prove that this method outperforms existing marine bioacoustic signal denoising algorithms such as Wiener filter, spectral subtraction and wavelet-based denoising method in terms of MSE, PSNR and SSIM, and is not sensitive to the change of signal-to-noise ratio of noisy samples.

AB Generalized low-rank approximation of matrix (GLRAM) is a multi-linear learning method and has been widely concerned due to its outstanding performance. It can make full use of the spatial information of features and save space and time complexity by directly dealing with matrix data. However, the existing methods may have trivial solutions and cannot consider the local structure of sample data. In this paper, we propose a sparse low-rank approximation of matrix and local preserving model for unsupervised image feature selection. This model mainly employ the L-2,L-1-norm sparse regularization of Kronecker product of two transformation matrices in GLRAM to avoid trivial solution and implement feature selection for images. Moreover, the weighted distance between the simplified representations of the original matrix data is used to preserve the local structure of image data into the transformation space. An iterative optimization algorithm is designed to efficiently solve the proposed model and the convergence and complexity of algorithm are analyzed. Comprehensive experiments on several image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB It remains challenging to assist BVI individuals in outdoor travel nowadays.In this paper, We propose a set of low-cost wearable obstacle avoidance devices and introduce an obstacle detection algorithm called L-PointPillars, which is based on point cloud data and is suitable for edge devices. We first model the obstacles faced by BVI individuals during outdoor travel and then establish a mapping between the information space and physical space based on point clouds. We then introduce depthwise separable convolution and attention mechanisms to develop L-PointPillars, a fast neural network for obstacle detection. This network is specifically designed for creating wearable obstacle detection devices. Finally, we implemented a wearable electronic travel aid device (WETAD) based on L-PointPillars on the Jetson Xavier NX. Experiments show that while L-PointPillars reduces the number of parameters in the original PointPillars by 75%, WETAD achieves an average obstacle detection accuracy of 95.3%. It takes an average of 144 milliseconds to process each frame during outdoor travel for BVI individuals, which is more than twice as fast as the Second network and 31% improvement compared to PointPillars.

AB Industrial defect detection is a hot topic in the field of computer vision. It is a challenging task due to complex features and many categories of industrial defects. In this paper, a deep learning model based on the multiscale feature extraction module is introduced for steel surface defect detection. The main focus on the feature extraction capability of the model and feature fusion capability to improve the accuracy of the model for steel surface defect detection. First, to improve the feature extraction ability of the model, a multiscale feature extraction (MSFE) module is introduced. The MSFE module can effectively extract multiscale features through three branches that have different convolution kernel sizes. Second, an efficient feature fusion (EFF) module is proposed to optimize feature fusion by adding features from the backbone network to the neck network. Third, this paper puts forward a new Bottleneck module by reducing the normalization layer and activation function in the original Bottleneck module. Finally, the backbone network is deepened to further enhance the feature extraction ability of the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public NEU-DET dataset. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the designed modules and the proposed model. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed model achieves optimal accuracy(73.08% mAP@0.5) while maintaining a small number of parameters.

TI Point completion by a Stack-Style Folding Network with multi-scaled

AB Point cloud completion is prevalent due to the insufficient results from current point cloud acquisition equipments, where a large number of point data failed to represent a relatively complete shape. Existing point cloud completion algorithms, mostly encoder-decoder structures with grids transform (also presented as folding operation), can hardly obtain a persuasive representation of input clouds due to the issue that their bottleneck-shape result cannot tell a precise relationship between the global and local structures. For this reason, this article proposes a novel point cloud completion model based on a Stack-Style Folding Network (SSFN). Firstly, to enhance the deep latent feature extraction, SSFN enhances the exploitation of shape feature extractor by integrating both low-level point feature and high-level graphical feature. Next, a precise presentation is obtained from a high dimensional semantic space to improve the reconstruction ability. Finally, a refining module is designed to make a more evenly distributed result. Experimental results shows that our SSFN produces the most promising results of multiple representative metrics with a smaller scale parameters than current models.

ID ATTENTION
AB Identifying chemical-induced disease (CID) semantic relations in the biomedical literature, including both intra- and inter-sentence interactions, has significant implications for various downstream applications. Although various advanced methods have been proposed, they often overlook the cross-sentence dependency information, which is crucial for accurately predicting inter-sentence relations. In this study, we propose DEGREx, a novel graph-based neural model that presents a biomedical document as a dependency graph. DEGREx improves the long-distance relation extraction by allowing direct information exchange among document graph nodes through dependency connections. The information transition process is based on the idea of controller gates in long short-term memory networks. Our model, DEGREx, exerts a multi-task learning framework to jointly train relation extraction with named entity recognition, improving the performance of the CID extraction task. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our model DEGREx outperforms all nine compared recent state-of-the-art models.

ID NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION
AB One of the most interesting aspects of natural language is how texts cohere, which involves the pragmatic or semantic relations that hold between clauses (addition, cause-effect, conditional, similarity), referred to as discourse relations. A focus on the identification and classification of discourse relations appears as an imperative challenge to be resolved to support tasks such as text summarization, dialogue systems, and machine translation that need information above the clause level. Despite the recent interest in discourse relations in well-known languages such as English, data and experiments are still needed for typologically different and less-resourced languages. We report the most comprehensive investigation of shallow discourse parsing in Turkish, focusing on two main sub-tasks: identification of discourse relation realization types and the sense classification of explicit and implicit relations. The work is based on the approach of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (BERT) as an encoder and classifying the encoded data with neural network-based classifiers. We firstly identify the discourse relation realization type that holds in a given text, if there is any. Then, we move on to the sense classification of the identified explicit and implicit relations. In addition to in-domain experiments on a held-out test set from the Turkish Discourse Bank (TDB 1.2), we also report the out-domain performance of our models in order to evaluate its generalization abilities, using the Turkish part of the TED Multilingual Discourse Bank. Finally, we explore the effect of multilingual data aggregation on the classification of relation realization type through a cross-lingual experiment. The results suggest that our models perform relatively well despite the limited size of the TDB 1.2 and that there are language-specific aspects of detecting the types of discourse relation realization. We believe that the findings are important both in providing insights regarding the performance of the modern language models in a typologically different language and in the low-resource scenario, given that the TDB 1.2 is 1/20th of the Penn Discourse TreeBank in terms of the number of total relations.

AB Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) is broadly used for applications with high cost observations such as materials discovery. In BO, a derivative-free optimization algorithm is generally employed to maximize the acquisition function. In this study, we present a method for acquisition function maximization based on a (1 + 1)-evolutionary strategy in MOBO for materials discovery, which is a simple and easy-to-use approach with low computational complexity compared to conventional algorithms. In MOBO, weight vectors are used for scalarizing MO functions, typically employed to convert MO optimization into single-objective optimization. The weight vectors at each round of MOBO are generally obtained using either stochastic (random sampling) or deterministic methods based on searched results. To clarify the effect of both the scalarizing methods on MOBO, we examine the effectiveness of random sampling methods versus two deterministic methods: reference-vector-based and self-organizing map-based decomposition methods. Experimental results from four test functions and a hydrogen storage material database as a concrete application show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the random sampling method. These results implied that the proposed method was useful for real-world MOBO experiments in materials discovery.

AB In this paper, the fast algorithm of audio retrieval is more about the template matching process of audio feature parameters. Nowadays, people regard vocal music learning as a way to relax the mood, because vocal music not only helps people vent their emotions and convey their heartfelt thoughts, but also helps regulate our body and mind. Aiming at these problems, this paper designs a vocal self-study assistant system. The vocal self-study assistant system introduces the latest technology, which can enable people to learn vocal music anywhere and anytime. First of all, the search time is reduced through the hash structure, and the search efficiency is improved. The index structure proposed in this paper includes two parts: the surface layer of the hash table and the tree layer of the hash tree. A hash tree structure that can perfectly adapt to changes in the amount of data is also proposed. In addition, this article also introduces the efficient search algorithm built by the hash tree index. According to the experimental results, it can be found that the intelligent audio data rapid retrieval algorithm using the image registration method is similar to the intelligent audio retrieval algorithm based on the DTW algorithm. Compared with the former, it is more accurate. Therefore, the retrieval algorithm in this article can be applied to intelligent audio retrieval technology based on content and semantics.

AB Patient care requires certain human and material resources. In the current situation of uneven distribution of medical resources, it is difficult to achieve all-weather good nursing for patients. The emergence of intelligent medical system could solve this problem, through the patient parameters monitoring, implementation to understand the situation of patients, timely warning, auxiliary medical staff to achieve good nursing effect. This paper investigates the effect of comprehensive nursing intervention on the antiplatelet compliance of patients with percutaneous coronary intervention under the support of intelligent medical system. During the treatment period, the control group received basic medical and nursing intervention, while the observation group selected comprehensive nursing intervention under the support of intelligent medical system, including health education knowledge, psychological counseling, medication observation, and adverse reaction observation. HAMA score (14.58 & PLUSMN; 2.57), SAS score (40.53 & PLUSMN; 5.28), HAMD score (15.38 & PLUSMN; 2.46), SDS score (40.61 & PLUSMN; 5.13) in the observation group. Comprehensive medical nursing intervention has a significant effect on patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention by ticagrelor, which can reasonably relieve patients' anxiety and depression, reduce the incidence of side effects, and improve their satisfaction with medical care. Nursing is worth promoting.

AB Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) with a changing number of objectives receive little attention, but they exist widely in real life. These type of dynamics not only lead to expansion or contraction of Pareto optimal front/set (PF/PS) manifold, but also pose great challenges to balancing diversity and convergence. However, the current dynamic response mechanism has difficulty adapting these kind of problems. To tackle these problems, a decision space information driven algorithm (DSID) is proposed. Once the number of objectives changes, an individual guidance strategy based on manifold learning (IGSML) is introduced to identify solutions suitable for changes. Then IGSML produces excellent solutions by learning the manifold of these solutions. Meanwhile, a variable layering reconstruction strategy (VLRS) is proposed to divide the decision variables into three layers: convergence, diversity and multi-functional variables. Afterwards, VLRS takes into account the different degrees of influence of variables at different layers in the process of objective change, and makes targeted operations on different variables to quickly respond to changes. These two strategies cooperate with each other to balance the diversity and convergence. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on 15 benchmark functions with a varying number of objectives. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

ID SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Cross-domain rotating machinery fault diagnosis has achieved great success recently with the development of deep transfer learning. However, conventional deep transfer learning methods encounter a severe decline in prediction accuracy when fault samples are limited. Moreover, conventional deep transfer learning methods require additional parameter tuning rather than cold-start when applied to the target tasks, hampering their implementation in practical fault diagnosis applications. In this paper, a novel method, named momentum prototypical neural network (MoProNet), is proposed for cross-domain few-shot rotating machinery fault diagnosis. The MoProNet progressively updates the support encoder to address the prototype oscillation problem and enable the model to apply limited source domain samples to predict target domain faults with cold-start. The performance of the proposed MoProNet is tested on a bearing dataset and a hardware-in-the-loop high-speed train simulation platform, respectively, with over forty cross-domain few-shot fault diagnosis tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MoProNet achieves satisfactory results and outperforms the other comparable methods in the same cross-domain few-shot scenarios with the simple AlexNet backbone.

TI Which cascade is more decisive in rumor detection on social media: Based

AB Rumor detection research is widely carried out to control the negative impact of rumor spreading. Many researchers conduct their research based on data from social media and prefer to employ different information cascades on social media, such as reposts or replies, to detect rumors. However, most of them view reposts or replies only as input sequences and do not distinguish the two types of sequences and their effects. Hence, this paper proposes a model called "cascade-sequence-based rumor detection"(CSRD) to explore the differences between reposts and replies in rumor detection. The CSRD combines a modified dilated convolution with a bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network to extract the local and global features from the replies or reposts. Accordingly, two rumor datasets are collected from Twitter and Weibo. Based on the two datasets, three experiments are conducted with the proposed models: the rumor detection experiment, the attention-weight experiment, and the early detection experiment. The results reveal the differences between the repost and reply sequences in rumor detection. The differences in information density of reposts and replies affect rumor detection, where replies are denser and more decisive than reposts for obtaining a higher detection accuracy. The differences between the local and global features of the reposts and replies lead to differences in the detection accuracy, where the local features substantially impact the detection results more than the global features. Different data exposure levels of reposts and replies at different propagation stages also influence the accuracy of rumor detection.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This project aims to develop an extension to automated gait analysis that makes gait analysis available on smart devices. The alternative may serve as a baseline for future implementations that are cheaper, user-friendly and accessible to an ordinary smartphone or web browser. Accessibility of gait analysis on an application encourages people to check their walking patterns more regularly, and if the issue is very severe, they can take the next step of contacting a specialist. By collaborating with the Podiatry Department of the University of Malta and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation (CASIA), a considerable amount of gait data was acquired. The data consists of videos of people walking regularly or irregularly. But videos are not enough for the development of our system. The videos were inputted into a pose estimator whose goal was to outline the skeleton of the person throughout the video. Additionally, the pose estimator was modified to record the coordinates of the main joints concerning a gait cycle (hip, knee and ankle). These coordinates were then plotted as a scatter plot where the gait cycle is generated. With the coordinates extracted, kinematics were also extracted to create another model which detects different features for gait analysis. After the gait cycle of each video was extracted, the next step was to classify whether that gait cycle was either regular or irregular. This goal is achieved by passing the extracted data through the VGG16 architecture. The application was tested out on people which have either bad, good or slightly bad gaits to investigate the rigidity of the system. After a series of experiments, it can be concluded that the system performs with 94% accuracy just by using a mobile phone.

AB This paper proposes a tuning method based on the Pythagorean fuzzy similarity measure and multi-criteria decision-making to determine the most suitable controller parameters for Fractional-order Proportional Integral Derivative (FOPID) and Integer order Proportional Integral-Proportional Derivative (PI-PD) controllers. Due to the power of the Pythagorean fuzzy approach to evaluate a phenomenon with two memberships known as membership and non-membership, a multi-objective cost function based on the Pythagorean similarity measure is defined. The transient and steadystate properties of the system output were used for the multi-objective cost function. Thus, the determination of the controller parameters was considered a multi-criteria decision-making problem. Ant colony optimization for continuous domains (ACOR) and artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization are utilized to minimize multi-objective cost functions. The proposed method in the study was applied to three different systems: a second-order non-minimum phase stable system, a first-order unstable system with time delay, and a fractional-order unstable system with time delay, to validate its effectiveness. The cost function utilized in the proposed method is compared with the performance measures widely used in the literature based on the integral of the error, such as IAE (Integral Absolute Error), ITAE (Integral Time Absolute Error), ISE (Integral Square Error), and ITSE (Integral Time Square Error). The proposed method provides a more effective control performance by improving the system response characteristics compared to other cost functions. With the proposed method, the undershoot rate could be significantly reduced in the non-minimum phase system. In the other two systems, significant improvements were achieved compared to other methods by reducing the overshoot rate and oscillation. The proposed method does not require knowing the mathematical model of the system and offers a solution that does not require complex calculations. The proposed method can be used alone. Or it can be used as a second and fine-tuning method after a tuning process.

AB The existing image search engines allow web users to explore images from the grids. The traditional interaction is linear and lookup-based. Notably, scanning web search results is horizontal-vertical and cannot support in-depth browsing. This research emphasizes the significance of a multidimensional exploration scheme over traditional grid layouts in visually exploring web image search results. This research aims to antecedent the implications of visualization and related in-depth browsing via a multidimensional cubic graph representation over a search engine result page (SERP). Furthermore, this research uncovers usability issues in the traditional grid and 3-dimensional web image search space. We provide multidimensional cubic visualization and nonlinear in-depth browsing of web image search results. The proposed approach employs textual annotations and descriptions to represent results in cubic graphs that further support in-depth browsing via a search user interface (SUI) design. It allows nonlinear navigation in web image search results and enables exploration, browsing, visualization, previewing/viewing, and accessing images in a nonlinear, interactive, and usable way. The usability tests and detailed statistical significance analysis confirm the efficacy of cubic presentation over grid layouts. The investigation reveals improvement in overall user satisfaction, screen design, information & terminology, and system capability in exploring web image search results.

AB Over the years, the humanities community has increasingly requested the creation of artificial intelligence frameworks to help the study of cultural heritage. Document Layout segmentation, which aims at identifying the different structural components of a document page, is a particularly interesting task connected to this trend, specifically when it comes to handwritten texts. While there are many effective approaches to this problem, they all rely on large amounts of data for the training of the underlying models, which is rarely possible in a real-world scenario, as the process of producing the ground truth segmentation task with the required precision to the pixel level is a very time-consuming task and often requires a certain degree of domain knowledge regarding the documents at hand. For this reason, in this paper, we propose an effective few-shot learning framework for document layout segmentation relying on two novel components, namely a dynamic instance generation and a segmentation refinement module. This approach is able of achieving performances comparable to the current state of the art on the popular Diva-HisDB dataset, while relying on just a fraction of the available data.

DT Article
DE Automatic checkout; domain adaptation; edge guidance; object detection
AB Automatic checkout (ACO) aims at correctly generating complete shopping lists from checkout images. However, the domain gap between the single product in training data and multiple products in checkout images endows ACO tasks with a major difficulty. Despite remarkable advancements in recent years, resolving the significant domain gap remains challenging. It is possibly because networks trained solely on synthesized images may struggle to generalize well to realistic checkout scenarios. To this end, we propose a decoupled edge guidance network (DEGNet), which integrates synthesized and checkout images via a supervised domain adaptation approach and further learns common domain representations using a domain adapter. Specifically, an edge embedding module is designed for generating edge embedding images to introduce edge information. On this basis, we develop a decoupled feature extractor that takes original images and edge embedding images as input to jointly utilize image information and edge information. Furthermore, a novel proposal divide-and-conquer strategy (PDS) is proposed for the purpose of augmenting high-quality samples. Through experimental evaluation, DEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the retail product checkout (RPC) dataset, with checkout accuracy (cAcc) results of 93.47% and 95.25% in the average mode of faster RCNN and cascade RCNN frameworks, respectively. Codes are available at https://github.com/yourbikun/ DEGNet.

AB The susceptibility of deep neural networks (DNNs) to adversarial intrusions, exemplified by adversarial examples, is well-documented. Conventional attacks implement unstructured, pixel-wise perturbations to mislead classifiers, which often results in a noticeable departure from natural samples and lacks human-perceptible interpretability. In this work, we present an adversarial attack strategy that implements fine-granularity, semantic-meaning-oriented structural perturbations. Our proposed methodology manipulates the semantic attributes of images through the use of disentangled latent codes. We engineer adversarial perturbations by manipulating either a single latent code or a combination thereof. To this end, we propose two unsupervised semantic manipulation strategies: one based on vector-disentangled representation and the other on feature map-disentangled representation, taking into consideration the complexity of the latent codes and the smoothness of the reconstructed images. Our empirical evaluations, conducted extensively on real-world image data, showcase the potency of our attacks, particularly against black-box classifiers. Furthermore, we establish the existence of a universal semantic adversarial example that is agnostic to specific images.

AB Hyperspectral (HS) reconstruction from RGB images denotes the recovery of whole-scene HS information, which has attracted much attention recently. State-of-the-art approaches often adopt convolutional neural networks to learn the mapping for HS reconstruction from RGB images. However, they often do not achieve high HS reconstruction performance across different scenes consistently. In addition, their performance in recovering HS images from clean and real-world noisy RGB images is not consistent. To improve the HS reconstruction accuracy and robustness across different scenes and from different input images, we present an effective HSGAN framework with a two-stage adversarial training strategy. The generator is a four-level top-down architecture that extracts and combines features on multiple scales. To generalize well to real-world noisy images, we further propose a spatial-spectral attention block (SSAB) to learn both spatial-wise and channel-wise relations. We conduct the HS reconstruction experiments from both clean and real-world noisy RGB images on five well-known HS datasets. The results demonstrate that HSGAN achieves superior performance to existing methods. Please visit https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/HSGAN to try our codes.

ID TONGUE MOVEMENTS
AB Individuals with motor disabilities can benefit from an alternative means of interacting with the world: using their tongue. The tongue possesses precise movement capabilities within the mouth, allowing individuals to designate targets on the palate. This form of interaction, known as lingual interaction, enables users to perform basic functions by utilizing their tongues to indicate positions. The purpose of this work is to identify the lingual and palatal gestures proposed by end-users. In order to achieve this goal, our initial step was to examine relevant literature on the subject, including clinical studies on the motor capacity of the tongue, devices detecting the movement of the tongue, and current lingual interfaces (e.g., using a wheelchair). Then, we conducted a gesture elicitation study (GES) involving 24 (N = 24) participants, who proposed lingual and palatal gestures to perform 19 Internet of Things (IoT) referents, thus obtaining a corpus of 456 gestures. These gestures were clustered into similarity classes (80 unique gestures) and analyzed by dimension, nature, complexity, thinking time, and goodness-of-fit. Using the Agreement Rate (Ar) methodology, we present a set of 16 gestures for a lingual and palatal interface, which serve as a basis for further comparison with gestures suggested by disabled people.

AB We introduce a generic, language-independent method to collect a large percentage of offensive and hate tweets regardless of their topics or genres. We harness the extralinguistic information embedded in the emojis to collect a large number of offensive tweets. We apply the proposed method on Arabic tweets and compare it with English tweets-analyzing key cultural differences. We observed a constant usage of these emojis to represent offensiveness throughout different timespans on Twitter. We manually annotate and publicly release the largest Arabic dataset for offensive, fine-grained hate speech, vulgar, and violence content. Furthermore, we benchmark the dataset for detecting offensiveness and hate speech using different transformer architectures and perform in-depth linguistic analysis. We evaluate our models on external datasets-a Twitter dataset collected using a completely different method, and a multi-platform dataset containing comments from Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, for assessing generalization capability. Competitive results on these datasets suggest that the data collected using our method capture universal characteristics of offensive language. Our findings also highlight the common words used in offensive communications, common targets for hate speech, specific patterns in violence tweets, and pinpoint common classification errors that can be attributed to limitations of NLP models. We observe that even state-of-the-art transformer models may fail to take into account culture, background, and context or understand nuances present in real-world data such as sarcasm.

AB This research represents an innovative approach to combining solar energy storage with Battery Management System (BMS) technology for application in an electric vehicle. Solar photovoltaic panels to power an electric vehicle with an induction motor drive, existing BMS technology is inefficient. This proposed approach includes extensive control methods with experimental and simulation verification to regulate the BMS technology provides better results. For controlling the charging/discharging cycles of the Li-ion of battery system linked to an induction motor driven by solar panels, the suggested BMS method uses an FLC (Fuzzy Logic Controller). The BMS prevents the battery to becoming overcharged or drained. The BMS techniques are discussed in this work, including SOC (State-of-Charge), safe charging, and battery protection. The FLC implements reliable control shifting techniques during battery charging and discharging. FLC's methodology has been confirmed through simulation verifications in SIMULINK/MATLAB. The proposed BMS technique has a high State of Charge (SOC) of 80% and a charging efficiency of 95%.

AB In this paper, a novel fuzzy adaptive sliding mode control method is proposed for realizing the asymptotic trajectory tracking of robotic manipulators with control backlash and uncertainties. The fuzzy logic system is introduced into the sliding mode control to estimate the system uncertainties. For compensating the unknown lumped disturbance and accelerating the convergence process, an adaptive super-twisting sliding mode controller is proposed with a novel adaptive law. The system states reach the sliding mode surface in a finite time and the control effect is continuous without over-estimation and control chattering. Depending on the Lyapunov stability theory, the tracking error converges to zero in a fast-exponential form. The effectiveness of the proposed method is fully indicated by the simulation of a robotic manipulator system.

AB This paper is concentrated on the fault estimation of discrete-time Markov jump fuzzy systems via iterative learning based on current observers. A new approach is proposed to construct the observers with system outputs and covers the traditional one as a special case. With the help of a matched transformation and a structure separation technique, conditions for the resultant observer error systems to be stochastically stable are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that the proposed method is less conservative than the existing one. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In modern nations, people are more conscious of their health. As a result, one of the most active research fields has been improving medical field applications. According to medical data, Myocardial Infarction (MI) is the leading cause of illness and mortality worldwide. The diagnosis of MI involves a lot of uncertain values and imprecise information. Linear Diophantine Fuzzy Set (LDFS) removes the restrictions of existing prevailed concepts such as Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS), Pythagorean Fuzzy Set (PFS), and q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Set (q-ROFS). In this manuscript, we impart the idea of Linear Diophantine Multi-Fuzzy Soft Set (LDMFSS) and inspect some depict rudimentary properties. An order between parameters is established and the innovative theory of Lattice ordered Linear Diophantine Multi-Fuzzy Soft Set (LLDMFSS) is launched. The algorithmic approach is instigated by introducing Root Mean Square Sum (RMSS) soft set for diagnosing the risk level of patients, since Heart disease diagnosis continues to be a significant challenge for medical professionals with less experience. Here, our suggested theory is designed to address such a problem by considering the people who are most impacted by MI. In order to prioritize the parameters based on our demands, LLDMFSS is best appropriate for particular types of difficulties. The main goal is to introduce the idea of LLDMFSS and the use of LLDMFSS to predict MI. Its superiority is demonstrated with a comparison of our proposed work to current fuzzy sets.

AB A competitive and cost-effective public procurement (PP) process is essential for the effective use of public resources. In this work, we explore whether descriptions of procurement calls can be used to predict their outcomes. In particular, we focus on predicting four well-known economic metrics: (i) the number of offers, (ii) whether only a single offer is received, (iii) whether a foreign firm is awarded the contract, and (iv) whether the contract price exceeds the expected price. We extract the European Union's multilingual PP notices, covering 22 different languages. We investigate fine-tuning multilingual transformer models and propose two approaches: (1) multilayer perceptron (MLP) models with transformer embeddings for each business sector in which the training data are filtered based on the procurement category and (2) a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-based approach fine-tuned using triplet networks. The fine-tuned MBERT model outperforms all other models in predicting calls with a single offer and foreign contract awards, whereas our MLP-based filtering approach yields state-of-the-art results in predicting contracts in which the contract price exceeds the expected price. Furthermore, our KNN-based approach outperforms all the baselines in all tasks and our other proposed models in predicting the number of offers. Moreover, we investigate cross-lingual and multilingual training for our tasks and observe that multilingual training improves prediction accuracy in all our tasks. Overall, our experiments suggest that notice descriptions play an important role in the outcomes of PP calls.

AB Limited interpretability and understanding of machine learning methods in healthcare hinder their clinical impact. Imrie et al. discuss five types of machine learning interpretability. They examine medical stakeholders, highlight how interpretability meets their needs and emphasize the role of tailored interpretability in linking machine learning advancements to clinical impact.
   Applications of machine learning are becoming increasingly common in medicine and healthcare, enabling more accurate predictive models. However, this often comes at the cost of interpretability, limiting the clinical impact of machine learning methods. To realize the potential of machine learning in healthcare, it is critical to understand such models from the perspective of multiple stakeholders and various angles, necessitating different types of explanation. In this Perspective, we explore five fundamentally different types of post-hoc machine learning interpretability. We highlight the different types of information that they provide, and describe when each can be useful. We examine the various stakeholders in healthcare, delving into their specific objectives, requirements and goals. We discuss how current notions of interpretability can help meet these and what is required for each stakeholder to make machine learning models clinically impactful. Finally, to facilitate adoption, we release an open-source interpretability library containing implementations of the different types of interpretability, including tools for visualizing and exploring the explanations.

AB Parkinson's disease is a common, incurable neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically heterogeneous: it is likely that different cellular mechanisms drive the pathology in different individuals. So far it has not been possible to define the cellular mechanism underlying the neurodegenerative disease in life. We generated a machine learning-based model that can simultaneously predict the presence of disease and its primary mechanistic subtype in human neurons. We used stem cell technology to derive control or patient-derived neurons, and generated different disease subtypes through chemical induction or the presence of mutation. Multidimensional fluorescent labelling of organelles was performed in healthy control neurons and in four different disease subtypes, and both the quantitative single-cell fluorescence features and the images were used to independently train a series of classifiers to build deep neural networks. Quantitative cellular profile-based classifiers achieve an accuracy of 82%, whereas image-based deep neural networks predict control and four distinct disease subtypes with an accuracy of 95%. The machine learning-trained classifiers achieve their accuracy across all subtypes, using the organellar features of the mitochondria with the additional contribution of the lysosomes, confirming the biological importance of these pathways in Parkinson's. Altogether, we show that machine learning approaches applied to patient-derived cells are highly accurate at predicting disease subtypes, providing proof of concept that this approach may enable mechanistic stratification and precision medicine approaches in the future.
   Deep learning applied to live-cell images of patient-derived neurons aids predicting underlying mechanisms and gains insights into neurodegenerative diseases, facilitating the understanding of mechanistic heterogeneity. D'Sa and colleagues use patient-derived stem cell models, high-throughput imaging and machine learning algorithms to investigate Parkinson's disease subtyping.

AB Robotic Navigation Aids (RNAs) assist visually impaired individuals in independent navigation. However, existing research overlooks diverse obstacles and assumes equal responsibility for collision avoidance among intelligent entities. To address this, we propose Fuzzy Logic Controller-Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (FLC-ORCA). Our FLC-ORCA method assigns responsibility for collision avoidance and predicts the velocity of obstacles using a LiDAR-based mobile robot. We conduct experiments in the presence of static, dynamic, and intelligent entities, recording navigation paths, time taken, angle changes, and rerouting occurrences. The results demonstrate that the proposed FLC-ORCA successfully avoids collisions among objects with different collision avoidance protocols and varying liabilities in circumventing obstacles. Comparative analysis reveals that FLC-ORCA outperforms other state-of-the-art methods such as Improved A* and Directional Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (DORCA). It reduces the overall time taken to complete navigation by 16% and achieves the shortest completion time of 1 min and 38 s, with minimal rerouting (1 occurrence) and the smallest angle change (12 & DEG;). Our proposed FLC-ORCA challenges assumptions of equal responsibility and enables collision avoidance without pairwise manoeuvres. This approach significantly enhances obstacle avoidance, ensuring safer and more efficient robotic navigation for visually impaired individuals.

AB Well-honed CNN architectures trained with massive labeled images datasets are the state-of-the-art solution in many fields. In this paper, the weights of five commonly used pre-trained models are carefully analyzed for extracting their numerical characteristics and spatial distribution law. The general characteristics are: (1) the weights of a single convolutional layer conform to the distribution of symmetric power law. (2) the power exponent at the center of its convolutional kernel is relatively large, and the power exponent decreases radially from the center. (3) the value range of power exponents between layers is continuous from -0.5 to -3.5. Based on these founding, a weight initialization method is proposed in order to speed up the convergence and improve the performance of CNN models. The proposed weight initialization method is compared with several commonly used methods. Extensive experiments show that it can improve the con

AB This study aims to assess the spatiotemporal performance of Machine Learning-based techniques for simulating streamflow on a continental scale using Long-Sort Term Memory (LSTM) models. The dataset employed is derived from the Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX), encompassing 438 watersheds across the US. MOPEX has the longest data record (55 years) compared to other datasets which makes it very suitable for LSTM training. The impact of incorporating vegetation Greenness Fraction (GF) in the LSTMGF model was assessed. To gauge the models' performance, temporally and spatially, a range of assessment metrics were employed. Upon the integration of GF, the LSTM models either maintained or enhanced streamflow simulation across the US, contingent upon the watershed location and seasonal variations. Notably, the overall median KGE and Percent Bias (PB) values with the inclusion of GF were 0.723 and 4.09, in contrast to 0.717 and 4.94 without the incorporation of GF. In addition, the results indicated that LSTMGF had superior performance compared to LSTM in areas where there was significant seasonal variation in vegetation cover. Results show that using extensive data record (MOPEX) bolstered the performance of LSTM with a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) reaching up to 0.97 at certain stations compared to only 0.86 when 25 years are used for the training as it is the case of the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset. These findings corroborate the potential for integrating LSTM models into continental scale hydrological models such as the NOAA NextGen National Water Model.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a word-level sequence tagging task. The key of Chinese cybersecurity NER is to obtain meaningful word representations and to delicately model the inter-word relations. However, Chinese is a language of compound words and lacks morphological inflections. Moreover, the role and meaning of a word depends on the context in a complicated way. In this paper, we present an NER model named Star-HGCN, short for Star-Transformer with Hybrid embeddings and Graph Convolutional Network. To make full use of the intra-word information, we set a hybrid embedding layer at the very beginning, which enriches word representations with character-level information and part-of-speech features. More importantly, we further enhance the hybrid embeddings by modeling inter-word implicit local and long-range semantic associations using the efficient Star-Transformer architecture, and modeling the explicit syntactic dependencies between words in the dependency tree using the graph convolutional network. Experiments on the Chinese cybersecurity dataset show that our model is superior to other neural network methods for NER, and achieves a significant relative improvement of 36.59% for the class of software entities. Experiments on other public datasets also validate the effectiveness of the model on other general and specific domains.

AB Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms try to learn an agent by training a model that simulates the environment. However, the size of such models tends to be quite large which could be a burden as well. In this paper, we address the question, how we could design a model with fewer parameters than previous model-based approaches while achieving the same performance in the 100 K-interactions regime. For this purpose, we create a world model that combines a vector quantized-variational autoencoder to encode observations and a convolutional long short-term memory to model the dynamics. This is connected to a model-free proximal policy optimization agent to train purely on simulated experience from this world model. Detailed experiments on the Atari environments show that it is possible to reach comparable performance to the SimPLe method with a significantly smaller world model. A series of ablation studies justify our design choices and give additional insights.

AB E-portfolios, or electronic portfolios, have recently gained popularity as a means for students and continuous learners to present their skills, accomplishments, and other relevant information in an online format. To confirm learning outcomes, e-portfolios need secure, dependable, and privacy-protecting systems for issuing and verifying credentials. When any client changes their document, designs present in help are altered, and it is imperative to refresh them in setup data handling frameworks. Considering the unchanging nature of the text, it is a mind-boggling undertaking to refresh the changed substance in web-related applications. Making computerized antiques is one of the significant issues to be evident and solid in updated content. Existing frameworks give private organizations comprehensive, concentrated arrangements that depend on trusted outsiders to issue and confirm accreditations. In addition, they need to give students the tools to take ownership of and share the material in their e-portfolios with other organizations, which increases the potential for forgery and bogus credentials. This paper proposes the Trusty URI Learning-Based Secure Blockchain Management Schema (TURILSBMS). This framework ensures the legitimacy and uprightness of client certifications. What is more, the information relates to an e-portfolio. While unquestionable cases are used for e-portfolio qualification evidence confirmation and check, decentralized IDs and undeniable certificates are used for client profile differentiating proof, verification, and approval. We have planned and carried out a model of the proposed plot utilizing a Quorum consortium blockchain network. Considering the assessments, our arrangement is attainable, secure, and protective. Compared to traditional approaches, the proposed approach gives better privacy-based immutable digital artifact creation over nanopublication.

AB With the rapid development of computer technology, the amount of information data has exponentially increased, and the complexity of English text has become more challenging. However, there is still a significant amount of irrelevant and harmful information in English text data, which makes it difficult to effectively and efficiently utilize this data. As a result, developing effective methods for text classification has become a hot research topic in various industries and fields. This study also proposed a combination of the GA-SVM model and GA-FCM (genetic algorithm-fuzzy c-means) model. By using the GA-FCM model in conjunction with the GA-SVM model, the progressive clustering model can be developed, which can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of text classification results. Experimental results have shown that the proposed GA-SVM and GA-FCM models can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of text classification. The progressive clustering model based on these models can effectively filter out irrelevant and harmful information in English text data and accurately classify the text data into different categories. This has significant implications for various industries and fields, such as finance, healthcare, and social media, where effective text classification can enhance decision-making processes and improve overall performance.

AB Fine art sculpture refers to decorative objects and commemorative objects shaped to beautify the environment or memorial meaning, and have a certain meaning, symbol or shape. Reversible image steganography cannot only protect the invisibility of the image, but also completely restore the original carrier. There are various forms of reversible information carriers, such as images, text, audio, and video. Among them, JPEG images are often used as transfer objects in life, so the research of image steganography algorithms based on JPEG images has received widespread attention. This paper analyzes the various features of existing reversible information splicing algorithms for JPEG images theoretically, and compares various advantages and disadvantages through experimental research, and summarizes the system design of JPEG image reversible information splicing technology. At present, it mainly includes: can improve dense images proportional distortion performance; dense images at the file extension level can be controlled more economically; algorithm design should measure both the proportional distortion performance and the file extension at the same time. This paper also proposes a reversible information splicing algorithm for JPEG images based on multi-objective optimization. When designing the algorithm, the rate-distortion performance and file extension of confidential images are considered. A mathematical model for multi-objective optimization is proposed and designed for two goals the corresponding function is used to better measure the performance of the confidential image.

DE Relation extraction; Sequence tagging; Rethinking structure;
   Non-autoregressive decoding
ID SELECTION
AB Joint entity and relation extraction have become increasingly popular due to their knowledge graph construction advantages. Despite the promising results on this task, disregarding the multi-triple interaction poses a problem since multi-triples commonly appear in sentences and interact implicitly. This paper proposes a sequence tagging with a rethink structure method for joint extraction and builds upon a Seq2Seq framework. The model starts with a sentence encoder that vectorizes input text. Then the vectors are fed into a sequence tagging component to acquire pre-extracted triples. Afterward, a newly designed rethinking structure is utilized as a decoder, double-checking the pre-extracted triples. Specifically, the pre-extracted triples serve as the decoder's query vector. Thus, the decoder can simultaneously generate triples in a non-autoregressive manner. Since the decoder is aware of the entire set of per-extracted triples, it can effectively model the interactions. The model was comprehensively compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks on widely used datasets, NYT and WebNLG. The result shows that the extraction performance of our model is superior to that of SOTA, especially when the sample contains sufficient triple interactions.

AB The current research shows tremendous improvements in the business marketing processes because some problems are long-term bond yields and macroeconomic data handling at a minimum level. Any industry can revolutionize business marketing processes if it takes a specific business marketing model to eliminate such deficiencies, examines the various elements that occur in them, and finds out how to fix them. As a result, some factors have to be controlled for in this research. Innovations and advancements in signal processing techniques on business processes occur spontaneously in business processes that are managed like this. In the below-mentioned business improvement success factors, score, learning best, future creation, people involvement, goals setting, plan and develop is the most essential factor. The elimination of these factors causes some disruption in business marketing processes. These gaps cause problems in the field of science and technology-based business marketing. The problem caused by these factors is the excess usage of two-wheeler, which generates more vehicular crises. The smart helmet business is the only solution to this automotive crisis. But because some of the above problems occur to this business process marketing. Considering that some sensors to make smart helmets will develop the business in the name of this imperative, considering the factors of production are land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship as the centre, this research introduces signal processing technology to make a helmet. The signal processing-based helmet proposed here is constructive for business. This research suggests a smart helmet business with signal-processing technology. This study highlights how adopting the smart helmet product might improve corporate marketing procedures. According to the results of our research, when people use this smart helmet product, depending on how well they can use it, that specific business rises to the top and falls to the bottom. These business marketing methods operate at a greater level and are profitable whenever their capacity rises. The effectiveness of this smart helmet declines as accidents increase and corporate marketing procedures degrade. Since our production now depends on whether the intelligent helmets are beneficial or harmful and destructive. The analytical technique described below can be used to find them.

A FO integral type switching function is designed, and corresponding adaptive SMC laws are derived which ensure the FO sliding mode surface (SMS) is reachable after a finite time interval. The improved version of these control laws which have smaller oscillation and better control performance are also derived. A new lemma for proving the finite-time reachability of the FO SMS is developed. At last, numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of our theories.

AB This work investigates the protocol-based synchronization of inertial neural networks (INNs) with stochastic semi-Markovian jumping parameters and image encryption application. The semi-Markovian jumping process is adopted to characterize INNs under sudden complex changes. To conserve the limited available network bandwidth, an adaptive event-driven protocol (AEDP) is developed in the corresponding semi-Markovian jumping INNs (S-MJINNs), which not only reduces the amount of data transmission but also avoids the Zeno phenomenon. The objective is to construct an adaptive event-driven controller so that the drive and response systems maintain synchronous relationships. Based on the appropriate Lyapunov functional, integral inequality, and free weighting matrix, novel criteria are derived to realize the synchronization. Moreover, the desired adaptive event-driven controller is designed under a semi-Markovian jumping process. The proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical example and an image encryption process.

AB Due to the diversity and complexity of data information, traditional data fusion methods cannot effectively fuse multidimensional data, which affects the effective application of data. To achieve accurate and efficient fusion of multidimensional data, this experiment used back propagation (BP) neural network and fireworks algorithm (FWA) to establish the FWA-BP multidimensional data processing model, and a case study of PM2.5 concentration prediction was carried out by using the model. In the PM2.5 concentration prediction results, the trend between the FWA-BP prediction curve and the real curve was basically consistent, and the prediction deviation was less than 10. The average mean absolute error and root mean square error of FWA-BP network model in different samples were 3.7 and 4.3%, respectively. The correlation coefficient R value of FWA-BP network model was 0.963, which is higher than other network models. The results showed that FWA-BP network model could continuously optimize when predicting PM2.5 concentration, so as to avoid falling into local optimum prematurely. At the same time, the prediction accuracy is better with the improvement in the correlation coefficient between real and predicted value, which means, in computer technology of multisensor data fusion, this method can be applied better.

DE Attributed graph; Graph embedding; Multi-level; Community structure
AB Graph embedding has been extensively studied in the literature and is widely used in various applications such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and natural language processing. However, existing approaches ignore the attribute information or are limited to learning graph representations at certain graph scales without considering the layer-wise community structure to improve embedding learning. To tackle these problems, we propose a Community-aware graph Embedding method with Multi-level attribute integration, a novel attributed graph embedding framework. It first coarsens the topological structure and attributes information alternating in a parallel strategy. Then in each coarsened layer, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to naturally integrate node attributes and obtain node embedding representations. Next, we introduce neighbor propagation at the same layer, cross-layer community propagation, and consider community information of nodes in the coarsening process to modify the embedding representation. Compared with the previous graph embedding methods, experimental results in different application scenarios on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

AB Much of the world's data are time series. While offline exploration of time series can be useful, time series is almost unique in allowing the possibility of direct and immediate intervention. For example, if we are monitoring an industrial process and have an algorithm that predicts imminent failure, we could direct a controller to open a pressure release valve or initiate an evacuation plan. There is a plethora of tools to monitor time series for known behaviors (pattern matching), previously unknown highly conserved behaviors (motifs), evolving behaviors (chains) and unexpected behaviors (anomalies). In this work, we claim that there is another useful primitive, emerging behaviors that are worth monitoring for. We call such behaviors Novelets. We explain that Novelets are not anomalies, chains, or motifs but can be informally thought of as initially apparent anomalies that are later discovered to be motifs. We will show that Novelets have a natural interpretation in many disciplines, including science, medicine, and industry. As we will further demonstrate, Novelet discovery can have many downstream uses, including prognostics and abnormal behavior detection. We will demonstrate the utility of our proposed primitive on a diverse set of challenging domains.

AB Attribute reduction is capable of reducing the dimensionality of data and improving the performance of data mining. As a reasonable representative of relationships between samples, neighbor inconsistent pair focuses on measuring uncertainty in information systems. Nevertheless, classical attribute reduction methods are static and unsuitable for data with variations. Additionally, it is inevitable for data to undergo changes in real-life scenarios, such as an increase in the number of samples. Therefore, it is essential to identify an efficient method for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving the classification accuracy. Inspired by these deficiencies, our focus lies on developing effective and efficient incremental methods that employ the neighbor inconsistent pair selection strategy for decision tables involving object variations. At first, some concepts related to rough sets, simplified decision tables and neighbor inconsistent pairs are introduced. Then, the heuristic attribute reduction algorithms for dynamic decision tables with the variation of object sets are designed by neighbor inconsistent pairs. Next, a novel feature selection procedure, which we refer to as incremental neighbor inconsistent pair selection, is proposed to update reducts for dynamic decision tables with the variation of object sets. Finally, two incremental attribute reduction algorithms based on neighbor inconsistent pair selection are designed. Furthermore, experiments are conducted on real datasets to validate the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed incremental algorithms. The results indicate that our algorithms exhibit minimal computing time requirements while achieving the highest classification accuracy among at least ten out of thirteen datasets when compared to the comparative algorithms.

ID PROCESS DYNAMICS
AB In the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, the fault diagnosis of the air handling unit (AHU) is critical to ensure the proper operation of the whole system. The AHU system with complex feature variables is susceptible to noise in operation, which influences the diagnostic performance of the fault diagnosis approach. To further improve the fault diagnosis accuracy, this paper proposes an AHU fault diagnosis model based on probabilistic slow feature analysis (PSFA) and attention residual network (AResNet). Firstly, to suppress the influence of noise on fault diagnosis while dealing with the AHU dynamic temporal characteristics, the PSFA-based feature extraction method is proposed. Further, in order to focus on significant features and suppress unnecessary regional responses of the observed data, the AResNet is utilized to construct the fault diagnosis classifier. Before building the AResNet classifier, we adopt the data spatialization method to convert the process data into spatial grayscale images to achieve spatial placement of key features and enhance the spatial correlation characteristics between multiple features. Finally, detailed experiments and comparisons are made, in which three different intensities of noise are added to the experimental data provided by ASHRAE research project RP-1312. Experimental results show that the proposed PSFA-AResNet model has the best fault diagnosis performance at all three noise levels compared with other deep and shallow popular methods.

AB Data mining provides various frequent pattern mining methods to help business owners identify items with frequency or utility values greater than a particular threshold. Conversely, in the stock markets with a wide variety of stocks, a major challenge for buyers is to choose a set of items whose total price is less than their budget. In addition, many investors take into account the liquidity of the stock shares, which can return their capital at any time. However, the existing pattern mining techniques do not offer an appropriate solution to address this challenge. Therefore, the proposed framework tries to offer a set of stocks as a liquid purchasing portfolio by using pattern mining techniques and analyzing stock market data. First, by introducing the Ranking Tables, it explores stocks with the highest trading value that can be traded over time. Second, a new algorithm based on multivariate time series data is devised for mining frequent items that aims at selecting the maximum number of stocks whose buyers' power is greater than their sellers' power simultaneously. In addition, using stock prediction techniques, profitable stocks are identified and offered by considering the user's budget. The framework was compared with FTPM, FPTMwEVL, and MTS-FPM, frequent itemset mining algorithms on time-series data. In addition, it was evaluated in different aspects, like liquidity and profitability within the market. The results of the experiments indicate that this framework offers four times more liquidity as well as 60% more profitability over time compared to the whole market.

AB Database migration is an important problem faced by companies dealing with big data. Not only is migration a costly procedure, but it also involves serious security risks as well. For some institutions, the primary focus is on reducing the cost of the migration operation, which manifests itself in application testing. For other institutions, minimizing security risks is the most important goal, especially if the data involved is of a sensitive nature. In the literature, the database migration problem has been studied from a test cost minimization perspective. In this paper, we focus on an orthogonal measure, i.e., security risk minimization. We associate security with the number of shifts needed to complete the migration task. Ideally, we want to complete the migration in as few shifts as possible, so that the risk of data exposure is minimized. In this paper, we provide a formal framework for studying the database migration problem from the perspective of security risk minimization (shift minimization) and establish the computational complexities of several models in the same. For the NP-hard models, we develop memetic algorithms that produce solutions that are within 10% and 7% of the optimal in 95% of the instances under 8 and 82 seconds, respectively.

ID GAUSSIAN-IMPULSE NOISE
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated impressive results in additive white Gaussian noise removal due to their strong fitting ability. However, their performance in mixed noise removal remains unsatisfactory, primarily due to their limited receptive field that focuses only on the local features of images and disregards global information. To ameliorate this issue, recent state-of-the-art approaches employ attention mechanism (AM) to capture the global information. However, most AM based methods still suffer from low computational efficiency. In this paper, a novel model named simple dual attention mechanism UNet (SDAUNet) for mixed noise removal is proposed. In SDAUNet, the UNet architecture is used to gradually acquire multi-scale image features and provide a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the image features than other CNNs. A simple dual attention convolutional block is presented to acquire the global image features that can successfully capture image details with a low burden. The experimental results demonstrate that the SDAUNet model can achieve better measurement metrics and visual performance than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) require accurate localization of sensor nodes for various applications. In this article, we propose the distance vector hop localization method (DVHLM) to address the node dislocation issue in real-time networks. The proposed method combines trilateration and Particle Swarm Optimization techniques to estimate the location of unknown or dislocated nodes. Our methodology includes four steps: coordinate calculation, distance calculation, unknown node position estimation, and estimation correction. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted simulation experiments and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods in terms of localization accuracy with known nodes, dislocated nodes, and shadowing effects. Our results demonstrate that DVHLM outperforms the existing methods and achieves better localization accuracy with reduced error. This article provides a valuable contribution to the field of WSNs by proposing a new method with a detailed methodology and superior performance.

AB Any watershed, when defined on a stack on a normal pseudomanifold of dimension d, is a pure (d - 1)-subcomplex that satisfies a drop-of-water principle. In this paper, we introduce Morse stacks, a class of functions that are equivalent to discrete Morse functions. We show that the watershed of a Morse stack on a normal pseudomanifold is uniquely defined and can be obtained with a linear-time algorithm relying on a sequence of collapses. Last, we prove that such a watershed is the cut of the unique minimum spanning forest, rooted in the minima of the Morse stack, of the facet graph of the pseudomanifold.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for building a robust instance segmentation model that can effectively detect objects on construction sites under various weather conditions. We utilize generative adversarial networks (GAN) to create a dataset of construction site images containing different weather conditions and customized the GAN to generate images that reflect the characteristics of the PTZ camera view and weather conditions, while preserving unique construction site entities. The study highlights the importance of modifying deep learning models to fit the unique environment of the construction site to develop models that can detect objects under various weather conditions and improve safety at construction sites. The proposed methodology includes creating a dataset of construction site images that incorporates various weather conditions and developing an instance segmentation model that can be applied effectively to real construction sites. By training the model on images that reflect different weather conditions, the segmentation performance of YolactEdge improved by 2.5% compared to the baseline model. Our future research includes expanding to more complex visual tasks, such as visual relationship and scene-graph generation, to develop even more diverse deep learning models that can be used in construction sites and further improve safety monitoring.

AB This article proposes a novel adaptive event-sampled learning method for addressing the optimal tracking control problem for robotic systems with motion constraints. In many practical systems, the joint movement of robots is restricted by mechanical structures or operational limitations, thus prescribed constraints are imposed on the joint states of the robot. To deal with the issue, a state-dependent transformation method is used to ensure motion restrictions and construct an unconstrained tracking error system. Then, for the transformed system, the constrained control problem is turned into a general optimal tracking control problem. To obtain the optimal solution, an only-critic learning-based framework is developed. Two novel event-sampled mechanisms are incorporated into the controller designs, reducing the state sampling times and computing costs. It is proven that the stability of the closed-loop system is ensured and the Zeno behavior is successfully eliminated via event-sampled learning control approaches. Finally, simulation and comparisons are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results and proposed learning-based control approach.

AB Introduction: Metric learning, as a fundamental research direction in the field of computer vision, has played a crucial role in image matching. Traditional metric learning methods aim at constructing two-branch siamese neural networks to address the challenge of image matching, but they often overlook to cross-source and cross-view scenarios.
   Methods: In this article, a multi-branch metric learning model is proposed to address these limitations. The main contributions of this work are as follows: Firstly, we design a multi-branch siamese network model that enhances measurement reliability through information compensation among data points. Secondly, we construct a non-local information perception and fusion model, which accurately distinguishes positive and negative samples by fusing information at different scales. Thirdly, we enhance the model by integrating semantic information and establish an information consistency mapping between multiple branches, thereby improving the robustness in cross-source and cross-view scenarios.
   Results: Experimental tests which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method are carried out under various conditions, including homologous, heterogeneous, multi-view, and crossview scenarios. Compared to the state-of-the-art comparison algorithms, our proposed algorithm achieves an improvement of similar to 1, 2, 1, and 1% in terms of similarity measurement Recall@10, respectively, under these four conditions.
   Discussion: In addition, our work provides an idea for improving the crossscene application ability of UAV positioning and navigation algorithm.

DT Article
ID PARAMETERS; SINGLE
AB The lack of control in voltage overshoots, transient response, and steady-state error are common issues that frequently occur in a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system which can degrade the battery storage and negatively impact other grid components. It may result in damage to equipment and reduce the efficiency of the overall power system. To improve the efficiency of the overall power system, an artificial intelligence (AI) optimization technique is used to determine the optimal sliding mode controller (SMC) gain. The present work proposes the accomplishment of a control strategy for designing a finite-time sliding mode maximum power point controller for a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system under fast-changing atmospheric conditions. A particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is used to determine the optimal sliding mode controller (SMC) gains used in perturb and observe (P & O) algorithms. Two modes of operation are available: offline mode for testing different sets of SMC gains leading to optimum values, and online mode for driving the variable step of the P & O MPPT using the SMC optimum gains. The Simscape-power system toolbox (Version 2020A) has been used successfully to study the effectiveness of MPPT. An evaluation of the proposed MPPT compared to the fixed-step P & O is presented. The proposed AI algorithm performs significantly better under fast-changing atmospheric conditions, particularly in transient, steady-state, and dynamic responses. In addition to tuning SMC parameters using PSO, our main contribution is improving the performance of the proposed algorithm to effectively track the maximum power point (MPP) at low oscillation, low ripple, low overshoot, and good rapidity in both slow and fast-changing atmospheric conditions. A three-phase grid-connected PV system with an inverter is described in the present work. The proposed strategy is centered around optimizing the controller of a three-phase grid-connected inverter system in order to improve the power quality.

AB A normalization method of road adhesion coefficient and tire cornering stiffness is proposed to provide the significant information for vehicle direct yaw-moment control (DYC) system design. This method is carried out based on a fractional-order multi-variable gray model (FOMVGM) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. A FOMVGM is used to generate training data and testing data for LSTM network, and LSTM network is employed to predict tire cornering stiffness with road adhesion coefficient. In addition to that, tire cornering stiffness represented by road adhesion coefficient can be used to built vehicle lateral dynamic model and participate in DYC robust controller design. Simulations under different driving cycles are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed normalization method of road adhesion coefficient and tire cornering stiffness and vehicle DYC robust control system, respectively.

AB Autistic people are often disadvantaged in employment, education, etc. In fact, autistic students/employees face several challenges navigating and communicating with their superiors and colleagues. Mobile applications for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD apps for short) have been increasingly being adapted to help autistic people manage their conditions and daily activities. User feedback analysis is an effective method that can be used to improve ASD apps' services. In this article, we investigate the usage of ASD apps to improve the quality of life for autistic students/employees based on user feedback analysis. For this purpose, we analyze user reviews suggested on highly ranked ASD apps for college students, and workers. A total of 97,051 reviews have been collected from 13 ASD apps available on Google Play and Apple App stores. The collected reviews have been classified into negative, positive, and neutral opinions. This analysis has been performed using machine learning and deep learning models. The best performances were provided by combining RNN and LSTM models with an accuracy of 96.58% and an AUC of 99.41%. Finally, we provide some recommendations to improve ASD apps to assist developers in upgrading the main services provided by their apps.

AB It is important to be able to measure the similarity between two uncertain concepts for many real-life AI applications, such as image retrieval, collaborative filtering, risk assessment, and data clustering. Cloud models are important cognitive computing models that show promise in measuring the similarity of uncertain concepts. Here, we aim to address the shortcomings of existing cloud model similarity measurement algorithms, such as poor discrimination ability and unstable measurement results. We propose an EPTCM algorithm based on the triangular fuzzy number EW-type closeness and cloud drop variance, considering the shape and distance similarities of existing cloud models. The experimental results show that the EPTCM algorithm has good recognition and classification accuracy and is more accurate than the existing Likeness comparing method (LICM), overlap-based expectation curve (OECM), fuzzy distance -based similarity (FDCM) and multidimensional similarity cloud model (MSCM) methods. The experimental results also demonstrate that the EPTCM algorithm has successfully overcome the shortcomings of existing algorithms. In summary, the EPTCM method proposed here is effective and feasible to implement.

AB The driving process involves many layers of planning and navigation, in order to enable tractable solutions for the otherwise highly complex problem of autonomous driving. One such layer involves an inherent discrete layer of decision-making corresponding to tactical maneuvers. Inspired by this, the focus of this work is predicting high-level maneuvers for the ego-vehicle. As maneuver prediction is fundamentally feedback-structured, it requires modeling techniques that take into consideration the interaction awareness of the traffic agents involved. This work addresses this challenge by modeling the traffic scenario as an interaction graph and proposing three deep learning architectures for interaction-aware tactical maneuver prediction of the ego-vehicle. These architectures are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) for extracting spatial features among traffic agents and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for extracting dynamic motion patterns of surrounding agents. These proposed architectures have been trained and evaluated using BLVD dataset. Moreover, this dataset is expanded using data augmentation, data oversampling and data undersampling approaches, to strengthen model's resilience and enhance the learning process. Lastly, we compare proposed learning architectures for ego-vehicle maneuver prediction in various driving circumstances with various numbers of surrounding traffic agents in order to effectively verify the proposed architectures.

AB Tropical cyclones are the world's deadliest natural disasters, especially causing tree death by pulling out or breaking the roots of trees, which has a great impact on the forest ecosystem and forest owners. To minimize additional damage, an efficient approach is needed to quickly grasp information on the location and distribution of fallen trees. There are several studies that try to detect fallen trees in the past, but most of the research requires huge costs and is difficult to utilize. This research focuses on resolving those problems. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is widely used for ground detection for those who need a cost-effective way while pursuing high-resolution images. To take this advantage, this research collects data mainly using a UAV with an auxiliary high-resolution camera. The collected data is used for training the YOLOX model, an object detection algorithm, which can perform an accurate detection within a remarkably short time period. Also, by using YOLOX as a detection model, a wide-range versatility is obtained, which means, the solution driven by this research can be utilized for every scenario where inexpensive, but highly reliable object detection result is needed. This research implements a visualization application that displays detection results, calculated by a trained model, in a client-friendly way. Fallen trees are recognized in images or videos, and the analyzed results are provided as web-based visualizations.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEMANTIC COMPUTING

DE 3D bounding box prediction; unseen objects; surface normals; synthetic
   data geometric; primitives; object pose annotation
AB A considerable amount of research is concerned with the challenging task of estimating three-dimensional (3D) pose and size for multi-object indoor scene configurations. Many existing models rely on a priori known object models, such as 3D CAD models and are therefore limited to a predefined set of object categories. This closed-set constraint limits the range of applications for robots interacting in dynamic environments where previously unseen objects may appear. This paper addresses this problem with a highly generic 3D bounding box detection method that relies entirely on geometric cues obtained from depth data percepts. While the generation of synthetic data, e.g. synthetic depth maps, is commonly used for this task, the well-known synth-to-real gap often emerges, which prohibits transition of models trained solely on synthetic data to the real world. To ameliorate this problem, we use stereo depth computation on synthetic data to obtain pseudo-realistic disparity maps. We then propose an intermediate representation, namely disparity-scaled surface normal (SN) images, which encodes geometry and at the same time preserves depth/scale information unlike the commonly used standard SNs. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, detecting everyday objects on a captured data set of tabletop scenes, and compare it to the popular PoseCNN model. We quantitatively show that standard SNs are less adequate for challenging 3D detection tasks by comparing predictions from the model trained on disparity alone, SNs and disparity-scaled SNs. Additionally, in an ablation study we investigate the minimal number of training samples required for such a learning task. Lastly, we make the tool used for 3D object annotation publicly available at: https://preview.tinyurl.com/3ycn8v5k.

AB Interactions that involve a group of people or objects are omnipresent in practice. Some examples include the list of recipients of an email, the group of co-authors of a publication, and the users participating in online discussion threads. These interactions are modeled as hypergraphs in which each hyperedge is a set of nodes constituting an interaction. In a hypergraph, the k-core is the sub-hypergraph within which the degree of each node is at least k. Investigating the k-core structures is valuable in revealing some properties of the hypergraph, one of which is the network behavior when facing attacks. Networks in practice are often prone to attacks by which the attacker removes a portion of the nodes or hyperedges to weaken some properties of the networks. The resilience of the k-cores is an indicator of the robustness of the network against such attacks. In this work, we investigate the core resilience of real-world hypergraphs against deletion attacks. How robust are the core structures of real-world hypergraphs in these attack scenarios? Given the complexity of a real-world hypergraph, how should we supplement the hypergraph with augmented hyperedges to enhance its core resilience? In light of several empirical observations regarding core resilience, we present a two-step method that preserves and strengthens the core structures of the hypergraphs.

AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) are becoming essential resources for many downstream applications. However, their incompleteness may limit their potential. Thus, continuous curation is needed to mitigate this problem. One of the strategies to address this problem is KG alignment, i.e., forming a more complete KG by merging two or more KGs. This paper proposes i-Align, an interpretable KG alignment model. Unlike the existing KG alignment models, i-Align provides an explanation for each alignment prediction while maintaining high alignment performance. Experts can use the explanation to check the correctness of the alignment prediction. Thus, the high quality of a KG can be maintained during the curation process (e.g., the merging process of two KGs). To this end, a novel Transformer-based Graph Encoder (Trans-GE) is proposed as a key component of i-Align for aggregating information from entities' neighbors (structures). Trans-GE uses Edge-gated Attention that combines the adjacency matrix and the self-attention matrix to learn a gating mechanism to control the information aggregation from the neighboring entities. It also uses historical embeddings, allowing Trans-GE to be trained over mini-batches, or smaller sub-graphs, to address the scalability issue when encoding a large KG. Another component of i-Align is a Transformer encoder for aggregating entities' attributes. This way, i-Align can generate explanations in the form of a set of the most influential attributes/neighbors based on attention weights. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the power of i-Align. The experiments include several aspects, such as the model's effectiveness for aligning KGs, the quality of the generated explanations, and its practicality for aligning large KGs. The results show the effectiveness of i-Align in these aspects.

AB Traditional anomaly detection methods aim to identify objects that deviate from most other objects by treating all features equally. In contrast, contextual anomaly detection methods aim to detect objects that deviate from other objects within a context of similar objects by dividing the features into contextual features and behavioral features. In this paper, we develop connections between dependency-based traditional anomaly detection methods and contextual anomaly detection methods. Based on resulting insights, we propose a novel approach to inherently interpretable contextual anomaly detection that uses Quantile Regression Forests to model dependencies between features. Extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying contextual anomalies in terms of accuracy and interpretability.

AB Non-contact three-phase instantaneous voltage measurement is an emerging and challenging topic in modern smart grids. Existing measurement methods can hardly obtain accurate or instantaneous results attributed to the coupled three-phase information. Even though some advanced optimization algorithms have been developed, their performance should be further promoted. In this study, we first transform the measurement task into a single-objective optimization problem to address the deficiencies of existing methods. Then six problems with scalable numbers of decision variables and complexity of objectives are gathered to form a test suite for global optimization. Moreover, a knowledge-based cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm is proposed for solving the formulated problem. The main idea is to incorporate the physical properties and rules of the system into the design of an effective and efficient algorithm. By proposing the knowledge-based grouping and local search strategies, the proposed algorithm follows an iterated manner for balancing diversity maintenance and convergence enhancement during the cooperative co-evolution. Numerical studies comparing the proposed algorithm with 14 popular optimization algorithms demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. The practicability of the proposed modelling and optimization approach is validated on a hardware platform.

AB In real-world applications that involve complex data dependencies, it would be essential to proceed with machine learning tasks in an adaptable manner. This article presents a novel Mutually Adaptable Learning (MAL) approach that allows for, on the one hand, extracting the most crucial information from data, and on the other hand, maximally utilizing it through model learning, in a mutually adaptable manner. We elaborate our MAL approach by explaining how it determines the necessity for the adaptation of both features and the learning model, integratively adapts between feature selection and model learning, and optimally achieves the learning objective. To systematically validate the effectiveness of MAL, we conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging learning tasks from two representative domains: spatiotemporal prediction and chaotic behavioral prediction, where the complex data dependencies are general encountered. Results demonstrate that MAL outperforms existing learning methods. Moreover, we show that the formulated objective can be attained under an information-theoretic guarantee. With both empirical and theoretical supports, MAL offers an effective solution to the problem of feature and model adaptation to achieve desired learning objective for given complex tasks.

AB Delayed responses (DRs) to single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) in patients with severe refractory epilepsy, from their intracranial recordings, can help to identify regions associated with epileptogenicity. Automatic DR localization is a large step in speeding up the identification of epileptogenic focus. Here, for the first time, an adaptive iterative linearly constrained minimum variance beamformer (AI-LCMV) is developed and employed to localize the DR sources from intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded using subdural electrodes. The prime objective here is to accurately localize the regions for the corresponding DRs using an adaptive localization method that exploits the morphology of DRs as the desired sources. The traditional closed-form linearly constrained minimum variance (CF-LCMV) solution is meant for tracking the sources with dominating power. Here, by incorporating the morphology of DRs, as a constraint, to an iterative linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) solution, the array of subdural electrodes is used to localize the low-power DRs, some not even visible in any of the electrode signals. The results from the cases included in this study also indicate more distinctive locations compared to those achievable by conventional beamformers. Most importantly, the proposed AI-LCMV is able to localize the DRs invisible over other electrodes.

AB Sentiment analysis (SA), also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or emotional tone behind a piece of text. It involves analyzing the text to identify whether it expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. SA can be applied to various types of text data such as social media posts, customer reviews, news articles, and more. This experiment is based on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) dataset, which comprises movie reviews and the positive or negative labels related to them. Our research experiment's objective is to identify the model with the best accuracy and the most generality. Text preprocessing is the first and most critical phase in an NLP system since it significantly impacts the overall accuracy of the classification algorithms. The experiment implements unsupervised sentiment classification algorithms including Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner (VADER) and TextBlob. We also examine the supervised sentiment classifications methods such as Naive Bayes (Bernoulli NB and Multinomial NB). The Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) model is used to feature selection and extractions. The combination of Multinomial NB and TFIDF achieves the highest accuracy, 87.63%, for both classification reports based on our experiment result.

AB Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is an essential aspect of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), facilitating the assessment of mechanical components' health statuses and their times to failure. Currently, most deep learning-based RUL prediction methods can achieve accurate RUL point estimations. However, due to sample variability and degradation randomness, point estimations may contain uncertainties. To obtain both RUL prediction values and their corresponding uncertainty estimations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid-driven prediction method that effectively combines an Asymmetric Dual-Channel AutoEncoder and the Nonlinear Wiener Process (ADCAE-NWP). To achieve comprehensive feature extraction, two feature extraction channels are parallelly combined in the encoder. Moreover, to reduce the space-time overhead of the model training process, an asymmetric form of the autoencoder is composed by using only the fully connected layer in the decoder. Subsequently, the ADCAE model is trained to construct health indicators in an unsupervised manner. Finally, the RUL Probability Density Functions (PDFs) are calculated using the NWP. RUL predictions containing uncertainty estimations are obtained by calculating expectations over confidence intervals. The proposed model is experimentally validated and compared on two datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves better prediction performance than competing approaches.

AB Among the existing collaborative filtering approaches, graph-based collaborative filtering models that adopt graph convolutional networks for representation learning have achieved state-of-the-art results. However, most graph convolutions on the user-item graph treat all neighbors equally, while different users may have different interests and different items can belong to different categories, aggregating information about all neighbors without discrimination can lead to performance degradation. In addition, the user-item interaction graph is essentially a heterogeneous graph, but most of the existing models regard it as homogeneous, which also can lead to sub-optimal results. To address the above issues, we design a dual channel group-aware graph convolution model, called DG-GCN. Specifically, it first performs message passing on the user-item interaction graph to leverage the direct and higher-order connectivity information for further grouping, and then groups users and items separately through dual group-aware modules based on their latent interests and categories. This scheme allows nodes to learn from more similar homogeneous nodes, thus preventing noisy information from participating in the propagation process. Experimental results show that DG-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN model on all five benchmark datasets, with up to 5% and 4% relative improvements over LightGCN on Recall@20 and NDCG@20, respectively.

AB RGB-T salient object detection aims to identify the most attractive object(s) in a scene using RGB and thermal data. For this task, on the one hand, how to excavate salient clues is crucial to improve the detection performance of the model. On the other hand, strengthening the representation of salient features is still a huge challenge. In order to solve the above issues, this paper proposes excavating and enhancing CNN features to boost the performance of RGB-T salient object detection (E(2)Net). Specifically, we first design a new joint attention module (JAM) that jointly considers both dimensions of channel and pixel location to fully explore effective salient features by encoding contextual information as local features and simultaneously digging for useful clues from inside the channel. Different from previous works of expanding the feeling field, to enhance the feature representation, we propose a feature enhancement module (FEM), which realizes the parallel and independent learning of the four branches based on the channel splitting strategy, and greatly consolidates the feature expression ability. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms the existing twenty-two excellent models on three challenging benchmark datasets.

AB Accurate and efficient diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS)-related cardiac diseases is crucial for optimizing medical resources and enhancing clinical treatment efficiency. In this paper, we construct two distinct ECG datasets: a clinical 12-lead original ECG dataset and a clinical 12-lead standard ECG dataset. Our focus is on the automatic diagnosis of diseases clinically associated with acute coronary syndrome, specifically T wave changes, ST-T segment changes, and pathological Q waves. We propose a fine-tuned EfficientNet-based network for model construction and conduct comparative experiments using various state-of-the-art networks. Our experiments demonstrate satisfactory results in the classification of four types of ECGs: normal ECGs and three types of abnormal ECGs, with an overall classification accuracy of 73.333%. Notably, the model achieves a classification precision of 0.963 for pathological Q wave types and a classification specificity of 0.877, 0.859, 0.911, and 0.993 for the four types of models. To evaluate the model's performance, we randomly select a subset of ECGs and invite two groups of doctors, each with 4-5 years of experience in ECG interpretation, to determine the gold standard. A comparison of the proposed model's classification performance with the doctors' annotations reveals that for T wave changes and ST-T segment changes, the individual doctors' accuracy is 70.115%, while the proposed fine-tuning model achieves an accuracy of 71.111%. Thus, the performance of our model matches that of experienced doctors. Furthermore, we apply transfer learning to generalize the model trained on the original 12-lead ECG dataset to the new standard 12-lead ECG dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the transferred model achieves a classification accuracy of 71.066% on the standard dataset, equivalent to the accuracy obtained on the original ECG dataset. Notably, for the normal sinus rhythm type, the precision and sensitivity of the transferred model improved by 7.4% and 1.8%, respectively. Additionally, the ROC AUC values for normal sinus rhythm, T wave changes, and ST-T segment changes after transfer are 0.857, 0.714, and 0.770, respectively. Moreover, we utilize Grad-CAM technology to provide network interpretability, offering theoretical support for clinical electrocardiogram diagnosis based on ECG records and classification results. Regarding network model efficiency, the average classification time for the transferred learning network on each ECG is approximately 0.0035 s, indicating the model's suitability for clinical practice and its potential to enhance clinical diagnosis efficiency.

AB In this paper, we aim to create an intelligent system to predict the wholesale market prices and provide the input variables for producers to optimally approach the electricity Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Balancing Market (BM). We create a data set that includes open-source fundamental features collected from ENTSO-E, OPCOM, etc. and predict the DAM price using a univariate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) model and the sign (the deficit or surplus) of the system using ten Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. These new features are inserted as input to predict the imbalance prices with a stacked multivariate LSTM model. The predicted prices on DAM, system sign, and prices on BM are required to estimate the income from trading on DAM/BM and create optimal bidding strategies. This approach that combines classification to obtain a new significant feature (namely the imbalance sign) that is included into the input data set to further predict the imbalance prices using recurrent neural networks is an original method that can bring competitive advantages by creating optimal bids. Compared with the baseline, the proposed forecasting method for BM price improves Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 14.63%, RMSE by 20.45%, MAPE by 9.5% and R-2 by 1.76%. Probability of the sign is used as probability to trade on BM for increasing or decreasing the output, whereas MAE from the predicted BM prices is used to enhance the optimal bidding pairs of prices and quantities on DAM. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a complex method that integrates variables and results from both DAM and BM markets and combines prediction and optimization models to attain competitiveness in the electricity markets.

AB Evolutionary multitasking optimization, which concentrates on solving multiple tasks simultaneously, has been a core area of interest for researchers in recent years. Existing Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithms (MFEA) are quite dependent on the synergy among the tasks. Consequently, solving multiple tasks is prone to fall into local traps when the optimization enters a certain stage. The objective of this paper is to investigate these problems in more detail and provide corresponding solutions. Specifically, we propose a three-stage analysis method that divides the multitasking optimization problem into three stages and explain the MFEA features according to the individual distribution in each stage, based on which we further develop a Parametric Segmented Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm (PS-MFEA) and apply a precise search strategy in the algorithm. Additionally, we propose both a reinitialization mechanism and a backtracking mechanism to avoid local optima. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on two test sets of benchmark problems with different similarity levels and the discrete combinatorial optimization tasks of the traveling salesman problem. The results demonstrate that using PS-MFEA can obtain better performances in both test sets and solve practical problems.

AB Most existing heterogeneous graph neural network models need more effective integration and full exploitation of features at different network levels to prevent overfitting. To address these problems, we propose an interlayer feature fusion-based heterogeneous graph neural network model, FHGN. To enhance the representation of the original input features, a residual graph attention layer is presented to aggregate neighborhood node messages and updates the central node representation. To improve the perception ability of different nodes for neighborhood information, an interlayer feature fusion layer with different strategies is designed to integrate low-order embedding and high-order semantic information adaptively. To reduce the homogeneity for node embedding, a semantic feature fusion layer is proposed to fuse the node embeddings covering semantic information learned from the different meta-path subgraphs. Experiments on several datasets show that our model outperforms the existing related works.

AB The energy markets, particularly oil and gas, have been significantly affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of price and availability. In addition to the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war has contributed to concerns about the reduction in the oil supply. AI techniques are widely employed for prediction oil prices as an alternative to traditional techniques. In this paper, an AI-based optimization model called adaptive fox-inspired optimization (AFOX) model is presented, then recurrent neural network (RNN) is combined with AFOX to form a hybrid model called recurrent neural network with adaptive fox-inspired (RNN-AFOX) model. The proposed model is used to predict Crude Oil Prices. In the proposed model, AFOX is used to find the best hyper-parameters of the RNN and employed these hyper-parameters to build best RNN structure and use it to forecast the closing price of the oil market. The results show that the RNN-AFOX model achieved a high accuracy prediction with very small error and the coefficient of determination (R-squared) equal to 0.99 outperforming the RNN model in terms of accuracy prediction by about 24%, the FOX model by about 20% and the AFOX model by about 14%. Moreover, RNN-AFOX was evaluated under the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. The results show the efficiency of RNN-AFOX in forecasting the closing prices of oil with high accuracy. In general, the proposed RNN-AFOX model overcomes other studied models in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error, coefficient of determination (R-squared) and consumption time.

AB In this paper, we perform a short-run Electricity Price Forecast (EPF) with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), using an algorithm that selects the variables and optimizes the hyperparameters. The results are compared with one of the standout machine learning algorithms, namely eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). Apart from other EPF solutions, in this paper, we focus on the interval before and after the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine. Furthermore, compared to the previous papers that mainly approached German, Austrian, Australian, Spanish, Nordic electricity Day Ahead Markets (DAM), we emphasize on the EPF for one of the East-European countries-Romania whose market rules closely align with the rules of the European Union electricity DAM. The contribution of this study consists in creating a data set that spans from January 2019 to August 2022 and providing an algorithm to identify the best stacked LSTM architecture to cope with a challenging short-term EPF. The proposed algorithm identifies the most relevant variables using a correlation threshold and performs a combination of three parameters-hidden layer size, dropout and learning rate generating the best EPF results.

AB Today, the US pursues the global capture of data (understood as a significant engine of growth) by way of bi- and plurilateral trade agreements. However, the project of securing the global free flow of data has been pursued ever since the dawn of digital telecommunication in the 1960s and the US has made significant legal efforts to institutionalise it. These efforts have two phases: In the first 1970s and 80s "freedom of information" phase, the legal justification (and contestation) of the global free flow of data hinged on imagining data as information, and its exchange as a practice of liberty. The second phase began in the late 1990s and continues today. In this phase, the free flow of data is aligned with a free-trade agenda in the context of first e-commerce and, starting in the 2000s, through attempts at creating a global public domain of personal data for the platform economy. The global free flow of data is an intrinsic aspect of informational capitalism. Assuming a constitutive, but not commanding role for law in informational capitalism, we conclude that the US attempt at ensuring free flow for its informational corporations is neither an entirely contingent nor a necessary outcome. It is a product of legal imagination.

AB Accurate data annotation is essential to successfully implementing machine learning (ML) for regulatory compliance. Annotations allow organizations to train supervised ML algorithms and to adapt and audit the software they buy. The lack of annotation tools focused on regulatory data is slowing the adoption of established ML methodologies and process models, such as CRISP-DM, in various legal domains, including in regulatory compliance. This article introduces Ant, an open-source annotation software for regulatory compliance. Ant is designed to adapt to complex organizational processes and enable compliance experts to be in control of ML projects. By drawing on Business Process Modeling (BPM), we show that Ant can contribute to lift major technical bottlenecks to effectively implement regulatory compliance through software, such as the access to multiple sources of heterogeneous data and the integration of process complexities in the ML pipeline. We provide empirical data to validate the performance of Ant, illustrate its potential to speed up the adoption of ML in regulatory compliance, and highlight its limitations.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Graph neural networks; Graph injection attack; Attack invisibility;
   Homophily unnoticeability constraint
AB In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved excellent applications in classification or prediction tasks. Recent studies have demonstrated that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Graph Modification Attack (GMA) and Graph Injection Attack (GIA) are commonly attack strategies. Most graph adversarial attack methods are based on GMA, which has a clear drawback: the attacker needs high privileges to modify the original graph, making it difficult to execute in practice. GIA can perform attacks without modifying the original graph. However, many GIA models fail to take care of attack invisibility, i.e., fake nodes can be easily distinguished from the original nodes. To solve the above issue, we propose an imperceptible graph injection attack, named IMGIA. Specifically, IMGIA uses the normal distribution sampling and mask learning to generate fake node features and links respectively, and then uses the homophily unnoticeability constraint to improve the camouflage of the attack. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that IMGIA performs better than the existing state-of-the-art GIA methods. As an example, IMGIA shows an improvement in performance with an average increase in effectiveness of 2%.

AB Supply chain digital twin has emerged as a powerful tool in studying the behavior of an actual supply chain. However, most studies in the field of supply chain digital twin have only focused on what-if analysis that compares several different scenarios. This study proposes a data-driven evolutionary algorithm to efficiently solve the service constrained inventory optimization problem using historical data that generated by supply chain digital twins. The objective is to minimize the total costs while satisfying the required service level for a supply chain. The random forest algorithm is used to build surrogate models which can be used to estimate the total costs and service level in a supply chain. The surrogate models are optimized by an ensemble approach-based differential evolution algorithm which can adaptively use different search strategies to improve the performance during the computation process. A three-echelon supply chain digital twin on the geographic information system (GIS) map in real-time is used to examine the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the data-driven evolutionary algorithm can reduce the total costs and maintain the required service level. The finding suggests that our proposed method can learn from the historical data and generate better inventory policies for a supply chain digital twin.

AB In this paper, a novel Adaptive Parameter Strategy Differential Evolution (APSDE) algorithm is proposed to overcome the parameters dependence and avoid local optima. The Parameter Update Mechanism (PUM), which has three different strategies, is used to reduce the dependence on parameters of DE. The Adaptive Proportion Adjustment Mechanism (APAM) is used to balance the proportion of PUM strategies in different development terms of exploitation and exploration, and the Random Restart Mechanism (RRM) is used to improve population diversity when exploitation is in stagnation. The proposed algorithm is verified in the CEC2018 test functions and the results show that APSDE has good abilities of exploitation, exploration, convergence, and stability. Secondly, Midcourse Guidance Maneuver Decision-making (MGMD) in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air combat is studied and transformed into a single objective variational optimization problem, a MGMD system based on APSDE is established. Finally, the simulation of MGMD is carried out. The APSDE ranks first in the typical MGMD scenario experiment. In the adaptive Midcourse guidance confrontation, the winning rate of APSDE is 54%, and the statistical results show that the APSDE has an excellent MGMD ability.

AB Knowing the number of communities in the complex networks can have a great impact on the community detection process and can be considered a critical parameter for most community detection algorithms. Nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) is another type of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) method that considers the interactions among communities and has high interpretability and accuracy in community detection. Whereas community detection is an NP-hard problem, applying evolutionary algorithms is favored rather than classical methods. In the proposed approach, the number of communities in a network is heuristically examined based on the network topology structure. The genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the most widely accepted optimizing techniques and the oldest evolutionary algorithm which optimizes various issues. In this paper, first, a symmetric nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (SNMTF) is presented to detect communities as an optimization problem in complex networks, because most complex networks are symmetric. The projected gradient descent method is applied to the SNMTF algorithm (PGD-SNMTF) to improve efficiency. Then the GA is used for optimizing the factorization process and estimating the number of communities in the complex networks. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated based on the results obtained and the expected number of communities in the networks. In addition, the proposed approach is compared to other common methods such as elbow, silhouette, rule of thumb, and eigen-gap methods for estimating the number of communities in complex networks. The results of the proposed method indicate high efficiency and accuracy in estimating the number of communities in the investigated networks.

AB We address the Multicommodity Capacitated Fixed-charge Network Design problem with uncertain demands, which we formulate as a two-stage stochastic program. We rely on the progressive hedging (PH) algorithm of Rockafellar and Wets where the subproblems are defined using scenario groups. To address the problem, we propose an efficient matheuristic approach which we refer to as the Integrated Learning and Progressive Hedging. The proposed method takes advantage of a specialized learning-based matheuristic that is able to quickly produce high-quality solutions to multi-scenario subproblems. Furthermore, we propose a novel reference point definition, at each aggregation step of the PH algorithm, which leverages subproblem information regarding promising design variables. Extensive computational experiments illustrate that the proposed approach should be the method of choice when high-quality solutions to large instances of stochastic network problems need to be found quickly.

AB In discrete topology, discrete surfaces are well-known for their strong topological and regularity properties. Their definition is recursive, and checking if a poset is a discrete surface is tractable. Their applications are numerous: when domain unicoherence is ensured, they lead access to the tree of shapes, and then to filtering in the shape space (shapings); they also lead to Laplacian zero-crossing extraction, to brain tumor segmentation, and many other applications related to mathematical morphology. They have many advantages in digital geometry and digital topology since discrete surfaces do not have any pinches (and then the underlying polyhedron of their geometric realization can be parameterized). However, contrary to topological manifolds known in continuous topology, discrete surfaces do not have any boundary, which is not always realizable in practice (finite hyper-rectangles cannot be discrete surfaces due to their non-empty boundary). For this reason, we propose the three following contributions: (1) we introduce a new definition of boundary, called border, based on the definition of discrete surfaces, and which allows us to delimit any partially ordered set whenever it is not embedded in a greater ambient space, (2) we introduce P-well-composedness similar to well-composedness in the sense of Alexandrov but based on borders, (3) we propose new (possibly geometrical) structures called (smooth) n-PCM's which represent almost the same regularity as discrete surfaces and that are tractable thanks to their recursive definition, and (4) we prove several fundamental theorems relative to PCM's and their relations with discrete surfaces. We deeply believe that these new n-dimensional structures are promising for the discrete topology and digital geometry fields.

AB The deep neural network (DNN) relies heavily on local solvers like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, these methods are sensitive to initial points and hyperparameters for their local property, which affects the stability of the optimization of DNN. This paper presents a novel three-stage methodology, termed consensus particle swarm optimization-based trajectory unified optimization-assisted Trust-Tech (CPTT), for DNN training with high accuracy and robustness. The CPTT is composed of Stage I: exploration and consensus, Stage II: robustly convergence, and Stage III: search optima. We explore the effect of each stage of the CPTT methodology proposed in this paper to accomplish the following advantages: (1) high-quality local optimal solutions (LOSs) and (2) stable convergence in random initialization. The performance of CPTT has been evaluated in stages on popular classification model structures and benchmark datasets, and the performance improvement of CPTT has been evaluated in object detection models. Its optimization performance is also illustrated in a real-world application for drone-based visual inspection of electric power transmission line corridors.

AB Removing rain streaks from rainy images can improve the accuracy of computer vision applications such as object detection. In order to make full use of the frequency domain analysis characteristics of wavelet and combine the advantages of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Transformer, a Multi-level Wavelet Network Based on CNN-Transformer Hybrid Attention (MWN-CTHA) for single image deraining is proposed. MWN-CTHA obtains multi-scale low-frequency and high-frequency images through multi-level non-separable lifting wavelet transform and uses CNN-Transformer Hybrid Attention Block (CTHAB) to learn global structure and detail information from low-frequency and high-frequency, respectively. CTHAB consists of CA-SA Layer (CSL) and Detail-enhanced Attention Feed-forward Layer (DAFL). CSL uses the non-local modeling ability of self-attention to capture long-range rain streaks and uses convolutional attention to enhance the search ability for local rain streaks, where convolution can assist self-attention to achieve better feature representation. DAFL utilizes Depth-wise Convolutional Layer to supplement detailed features and filters the information of feed-forward layer through Dual-branch Attention. The experimental results on the four synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher PSNR and SSIM than the state-of-the-art method DANet, with an improvement of 1.07 dB and 0.0098, respectively. The code is available at .

ID CRITERION
AB Graph embedding methods are effective techniques for representing nodes and their relations in a continuous space. Specifically, the hyperbolic space is more effective than the Euclidean space for embedding graphs with tree-like structures. Thus, it is critical how to select the best dimensionality for the hyperbolic space in which a graph is embedded. This is because we cannot distinguish nodes well with dimensionality that is considerably low, whereas the embedded relations are affected by irregularities in data with excessively high dimensionality. We consider this problem from the viewpoint of statistical model selection for latent variable models. Thereafter, we propose a novel methodology for dimensionality selection based on the minimum description length principle. We aim to introduce a latent variable modeling of hyperbolic embeddings and apply the decomposed normalized maximum likelihood code-length to latent variable model selection. We empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of our method using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

AB Constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs) pose great challenges for evolutionary algorithms to reach an appropriate trade-off of solution feasibility, convergence, and diversity. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on adaptive infeasible ratio (CMaOEA-AIR). In the evolution process, CMaOEA-AIR adaptively determines the ratio of infeasible solutions to survive into the next generation according to the number and the objective values of the infeasible solutions. The feasible solutions then undergo an exploitation-biased environmental selection based on indicator ranking and diversity maintaining, while the infeasible solutions undergo environmental selection based on adaptive selection criteria, aiming at the enhancement of exploration. In this way, both feasible and infeasible solutions are appropriately used to balance the exploration and exploitation of the search space. The proposed CMaOEA-AIR is compared with the other state-of-the-art constrained many-objective optimization algorithms on three types of CMaOPs of up to 15 objectives. The experimental results show that CMaOEA-AIR is competitive with the compared algorithms considering the overall performance in terms of solution feasibility, convergence, and diversity.

AB Emotion recognition from EEG signals is a major field of research in cognitive computing. The major challenges involved in the task are extracting meaningful features from the signals and building an accurate model. This paper proposes a fuzzy ensemble-based deep learning approach to classify emotions from EEG-based models. Three individual deep learning models have been trained and combined using a fuzzy rank-based approach implemented using the Gompertz function. The model has been tested on two benchmark datasets: DEAP and AMIGOS. Our model has achieved 90.84% and 91.65% accuracies on the valence and arousal dimensions, respectively, for the DEAP dataset. The model also achieved accuracy above 95% on the DEAP dataset for the subject-dependent approach. On the AMIGOS dataset, our model has achieved state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.73% and 98.39% on the valence and arousal dimensions, respectively. The model achieved accuracies of 99.38% and 98.66% for the subject-independent and subject-dependent cases, respectively. The proposed model has provided satisfactory results on both DEAP and AMIGOS datasets and in both subject-dependent and subject-independent setups. Hence, we can conclude that this is a robust model for emotion recognition from EEG signals.

AB Element detection is a key step in non-destructive testing of printed circuit board (PCB) based on computed tomography (CT). In recent years, some image segmentation methods based on deep learning have shown great potential in the element segmentation task of PCB CT images, and greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy. However, since image segmentation is based on pixel-level classification, the annotation of training data is difficult and costly. Aiming at this problem, the authors proposed a new active learning method based on the integration of relevant information about segmentation tasks and data variance. In this method, the Result Quality Evaluation Module (RQEM) proposed by us is used to generate task-related information, and an adversarial network is used to generate the difference information between samples and the initial labelled data. Finally, the two parts of information are fused and used as the standard of data selecting. In the PCB CT image element segmentation task, the authors only need to select 12.7% of the whole training set with their proposed method to make Mean Intersection Over Union (MIOU) reach 79.7, which has reached 95% of the optimal performance of 83.7. The in-depth analysis also verifies the effectiveness and stability of the authors' method.

AB The rapid development of social networks has brought many conveniences, but it has also resulted in the wanton dissemination of negative information. Identifying key users in the network to block negative information in a timely and effective manner has become an urgent research task. For this purpose, this paper proposes a binary ions motion optimization algorithm to maximize the blocking of negative influence propagation under a competitive-based model. The algorithm adopts a degree-based heuristic initialization strategy by recoding search agents and blocking diffusion channels based on the negative seed location. To overcome the lack of crystal phase search ability, a crossover mechanism of anions and cations is introduced, which accelerates convergence and facilitates the discovery of optimal solution. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on real networks and synthetic networks, showing significant advancements compared to other algorithms.

AB An adaptive fractional-order sliding mode control (AFOSMC) is proposed to control a nonlinear fractional-order system. This scheme combines the features of sliding mode control and fractional control for improving the response of nonlinear systems. The structure of AFOSMC includes two units: fractional-order sliding mode control (FOSMC) and the tuning unit that employs a certain Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy logic system for online adjusting the parameters of FOSMC. Tuning the parameters of the FOSMC improves its performance with various control problems. Moreover, stability analysis of the proposed controller is studied using Lyapunov theorem. Finally, the developed control scheme is introduced for controlling a fractional-order gyroscope system. The proposed AFOSMC is implemented practically using a microcontroller where the test is carried out using the hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The practical results indicate the improvements and enhancements introduced by the developed controller under external disturbance, uncertainties and random noise effects.

AB Due to water scarcity in different regions of Iran, water supply management is a challenging task for authorities that calls for smart methods and the proper utilization of subterranean water resources. In order to handle the inherent complexity and various uncertainties in real-world scenarios, the implementation of appropriate multi-criteria decision-making techniques is required according to the challenges underlying the management of the water supply. The present study aims to propose a hybrid framework on fuzzy rough-MARCOS, which stands for measurement of alternatives and Ranking according to compromise solution. The fuzzy rough-MARCOS method provides the fuzzy rough reference points through the fuzzy rough ideal and anti-ideal solutions that offer a more precise determination of the utility degree. Throughout the evaluation process, the fuzzy rough number is employed to deal with uncertainty and imprecision in expert judgment. A case study of the village of Nohoor located in northeastern Iran is employed to illustrate how the suggested decision-making model can be used to choose the optimal method of water supply by utilizing subsurface water resources. There are four alternatives for getting water to the community of Nohoor. Our findings show that the optimal result for supplying water is through pipeline via path A. To verify the consistency of outcomes, a comparison of our suggested method with existing MCDM techniques, namely fuzzy rough-TOPSIS method, fuzzy MARCOS, rough MARCOS, is conducted.

AB Wind turbine sensor fault is considered a critical fault. Maintenance cost of wind energy conversion system increases while turbine sensor faults are unattended. Several fault detections models especially on the bench mark model of wind turbine are available. Bench Mark model defines the wind turbine model mathematically. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to detect the sensor fault in the model. Sensor pairs are used in the turbine to evaluate the fault using data analytics. Measured values from blade pitch, generator and rotor speed sensors are detected for faults. Wind turbine model with the fault detection model is developed using MATLAB to assess the performance of the SVM algorithm. The detection speed, training speed and generalization capability of SVM algorithm enable the use of this algorithm. Finally, the detection model is tested on the DSP28335 to validate the algorithm for real time compatibility. Simulation result approve that the SVM fault detection algorithm with sensor faults executing better speed. Data for training is taken from the simulation carried out for 4400 s to be emulated on the hardware for testing the real time fault detection process.

DT Article
DE Person re-identification; Meta-learning; Unsupervised; Pseudo-labels
AB Most unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with feature learning, and perform the two steps in an alternating fashion for training ReID models. However, incorrect/noisy pseudo-labels are often present due to various variations (e.g., human pose, illumination, and viewpoint, etc.). Such noisy pseudo-labels may harm the trained ReID models. In order to use diverse variations/information while minimizing negative influence of the noisy pseudo-labels, we propose a confidence-adapted meta-interaction (CAMI) method by explicitly exploring the interaction between the believable supervision (reliable pseudo-labels) and the diverse information. Specifically, CAMI iteratively trains the ReID model in a meta-learning manner, in which the training images are dynamically divided into a reliable set and an unreliable set. At each iteration, the pseudo-labels of images are predicted by clustering and the training images are divided by the proposed confidence-adapted sample disentanglement (CASD) method. To adapt the changes of the pseudo-labels and gradually refine the division, the CASD method dynamically predicts the pseudo-label confidence. It divides the training images into the reliable set (with high confidence pseudo-labels) and the unreliable set (with low confidence pseudo-labels), respectively. Then a meta-interaction method is proposed for training the ReID model, which consists of a meta-training step to use the believable supervision of the reliable set and a meta-testing step to use the diverse information of the unreliable set. Meanwhile, a bridge model is dynamically built to refine the unreliable set based on the believable supervision from the reliable set. The CAMI is evaluated by two unsupervised person ReID settings, including the image-based and the video-based. The experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CAMI.

AB Earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease is more significant for improving the quality of the patient's life. This aspect may reduce the fatality rate among the population and also maximize the average life expectancy. Thus, this paper introduces a new Alzheimer's prediction model using IoT and deep structured architectures. A new smart Alzheimer's patient monitoring system is developed by processing healthcare data using IoT devices. Initially, Alzheimer's patients are detected from the set of patients using "enhanced deep residual network-long short-term memory (DRN-LSTM)." Here, the detection process is done with the data associated with the patients. The optimal feature selection phase and enhanced deep convolutional network (DCN) and deep residual network (DRN)-based detection are accomplished by parameter-improved horse herd optimization algorithm (PI-HHO). The monitored data involve audio, data, and video from the sensors based on the location and movements of patients. Next, the gathered data are forwarded to the optimal feature selection with the same algorithm and predicted the abnormalities through enhanced DNN + LSTM using PI-HHO. Thirdly, the abnormal patients are alerted to the nearby hospital for appropriate treatment and monitoring. All through the result evaluation, the accuracy and precision rate of the recommended Alzheimer's patient monitoring system attain 98% and 97%. Thus, this smart patient prediction model ensures the high-quality results in terms of standard performance metrics while evaluating with other algorithms.

   denoising factor; Similar patch
AB Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD) is an effective method for point cloud denoising, however how to preserve the global and local structure during the denoising process and how to balance the denoising performance and its inherent large computational burden are still open questions in the field. To tackle these problems, an adaptive higher-order singular value decomposition method, AdaHOSVD including two sub-algorithms HOSVD-1 and HOSVD-2, is proposed in this work by adaptively setting the threshold value to truncate the kernel tensor, and by limiting the patch similarity searching within a search radius. Since point cloud is in 3D space rather than a 2D plane as in image cases, we extend the patch similarity detection in 3D space up to a 3D rigid motion; hence, more similar 3D patches could be detected, which in turn boosts its performance. We validate our method on two datasets. One is the 3D benchmark dataset including the ShapeNetCore and the 3D scanning repository of Stanford University, which contains a large body of diverse high quality shapes to assess its noise sensitivity, and the other is the Golden Temple and the Electric hook, which contains a large temple structure with abundant local repeated textural and shape patterns.

AB In this paper, we study the global exponential stability of a class of neutral-type Cohen-Grossberg neural networks (NTCGNNs) with multiple discrete and neutral time varying delays. Since the network model cannot be represented in the form of vector-matrix, a method based on system solutions is proposed to establish novel global exponential stability criteria for the NTCGNNs under consideration. This method can results in global exponential stability criteria consists of only a few linear scalar inequalities, and it does not need to set up any Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, which can greatly reduce a large amount of computations. Compared with the existing ones, the applicability of the obtained stability conditions are explained by two representative numerical examples. It is worth emphasizing that the method ground upon system solutions is first proposed, and is applicable for system models which can or cannot be represented in the form of vector-matrix.

AB In this paper we discuss learning Bayesian networks whose conditional probability tables are either Noisy-OR models or general conditional probability tables. We refer to these models as Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks. To learn their structure, we modify the Bayesian Information Criterion used for standard Bayesian networks to reflect the number of parameters of a Noisy-OR model. We prove that the log-likelihood function of a Noisy-OR model has a unique maximum and adapt the EM-learning method for the leaky Noisy-OR model. We propose a structure learning algorithm that learns optimal Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks. We evaluate the proposed approach on synthetic data, where it performs substantially better than standard Bayesian networks. We perform experiments with Bipartite Noisy-OR Bayesian networks of different complexity to find out when the results of Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks are significantly better than the results of standard Bayesian networks and when they perform similarly. We also study how different penalties based on the number of model parameters affect the quality of the results. Finally, we apply the suggested approach to a problem from the domain of linguistics. Specifically, we use Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian Networks to model the spread of loanwords in the South-East Asian Archipelago. We perform numerical experiments in which we compare the prediction ability of standard Bayesian networks with Mixed Noisy-OR Bayesian networks and test different pruning methods to reduce the number of parent sets considered.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Recently, neighborhood-based collaborative filtering has been increasingly used in personalized recommender systems. However, inevitably, the neighborhood selection is based on a single scale, i.e. selecting a fixed number of the nearest users/items. To solve this problem, we propose a new recommender system called Multi-scale Broad Collaborative Filtering (MBCF). The main contribution lies in designing a multi-scale collaborative vector for capturing the rich information from different numbers of the nearest users/items. However, it is undesirable to input the low-dimensional multiscale collaborative vector directly into the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which can easily lead to overfitting. For this reason, instead of DNNs, the Broad Learning System (BLS) is adopted as the mapping function to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between users and items, which can avoid the above problems while obtaining very satisfactory recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MBCF algorithm.

AB Speech, as a necessary way to express emotions, plays a vital role in human communication. With the continuous deepening of research on emotion recognition in human-computer interaction, speech emotion recognition (SER) has become an essential task to improve the human-computer interaction experience. When performing emotion feature extraction of speech, the method of cutting the speech spectrum will destroy the continuity of speech. Besides, the method of using the cascaded structure without cutting the speech spectrum cannot simultaneously extract speech spectrum information from both temporal and spatial domains. To this end, we propose a spatial-temporal parallel network for speech emotion recognition without cutting the speech spectrum. To further mix the temporal and spatial features, we design a novel fusion method (called multiple fusion) that combines the concatenate fusion and ensemble strategy. Finally, the experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB Because of the increasing fierce competition among automakers automotive facelift has become a common and popular market practice. However, very limited attentions have been paid to the impacts of this action due to its independence and uniqueness for each car model. This study is to examine the effects of automobile facelift on sales. We take GM's aggressive Three-Cylinder Engine replacement on Excelle model in China as an example, and employ a Bayesian structural time series model (BSTS) to conduct the counterfactual estimation of the impact by synthesizing the sales of competing models. After calibrating the proposed model with a proprietary panel dataset that includes real sales of all the selected cars from January 2017 to June 2018, we find that (1) The three-cylinder engine replacement resulted in an overall decrease of 13,000 in Buick Excelle's sales and a decrease of about 30% in relative terms. (2) Moreover, this facelift event has a negative impact on sales overall trend. In the short term, it has an upward trend compared with a downward trend in the long term. Our study provides a new method to quantify the impact of automotive facelift on sales and the findings have managerial implications for automakers.

AB The most essential purpose of the machine learning field is to minimize the difference between the true value and the predicted value, so that the predicted value can be as close to the true value as possible. For this reason, researchers have proposed a loss function as a criterion for learning, which can generally be connected with optimization learning through the loss function. In the field of machine learning, our commonly used optimization method is gradient descent, because it only needs to solve the first-order derivative, and the calculation complexity is small and the accuracy is within an acceptable range. But gradient descent has a problem that cannot be ignored-divergence. To solve this problem, we propose a homotopy analysis method. The homotopy analysis method can effectively control the convergence by introducing the convergence control parameters without divergence. At the same time, our experiments also show that our algorithm can not only guarantee convergence, but also reduce the number of iterations.

AB Considering the dynamics and non-linear characteristics of biped robots, gait optimization is an extremely challenging task. To tackle this issue, a parallel heterogeneous policy Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm for gait optimization is proposed. Firstly, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm is used as the main architecture to run multiple biped robots in parallel to interact with the environment. And the network is shared to improve the training efficiency. Furthermore, heterogeneous experience replay is employed instead of the traditional experience replay mechanism to optimize the utilization of experience. Secondly, according to the walking characteristics of biped robots, a biped robot periodic gait is designed with reference to sinusoidal curves. The periodic gait takes into account the effects of foot lift height, walking period, foot lift speed and ground contact force of the biped robot. Finally, different environments and different biped robot models pose challenges for different optimization algorithms. Thus, a unified gait optimization framework for biped robots based on the RoboCup3D platform is established. Comparative experiments were conducted using the unified gait optimization framework, and the experimental results show that the method outlined in this paper can make the biped robot walk faster and more stably.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to critical vulnerabilities when attacked by adversarial samples. This has prompted the development of attack and defense strategies similar to those used in cyberspace security. The dependence of such strategies on attack and defense mechanisms makes the associated algorithms on both sides appear as closely processes, with the defense method being particularly passive in these processes. Inspired by the dynamic defense approach proposed in cyberspace to address endless arm races, this article defines ensemble quantity, network structure, and smoothing parameters as variable ensemble attributes and proposes a stochastic ensemble strategy based on heterogeneous and redundant sub-models. The proposed method introduces the diversity and randomness characteristic of deep neural networks to alter the fixed correspondence gradient between input and output. The unpredictability and diversity of the gradients make it more difficult for attackers to directly implement white-box attacks, helping to address the extreme transferability and vulnerability of ensemble models under white-box attacks. Experimental comparison of ASR-vs.-distortion curves with different attack scenarios under CIFAR10 preliminarily demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method that even the highest-capacity attacker cannot easily outperform the attack success rate associated with the ensemble smoothed model, especially for untargeted attacks.

AB The choice of an optimal airport for local businesses for any traveling purpose due to the complexity of the access to the global market could be considered a group decision-making problem. To cope with this type of problem, the goal of this research is to introduce the power Muirhead mean operators into the environment of a 2-tuple linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (2TLq-ROFS). This paper proposes four novel aggregation operators: the 2TLq-ROF power Muirhead mean (2TLq-ROFPMM) operator, the 2TLq-ROF dual power Muirhead mean (2TLq-ROFDPMM) operator, the 2TLq-ROF weighted power Muirhead mean (2TLq-ROFWPMM) operator, and the 2TLq-ROF weighted dual power Muirhead mean (2TLq-ROFWDPMM) operator. Then, two new frameworks are constructed by employing the 2TLq-ROFWPMM and the 2TLq-ROFWDPMM aggregation operators to address challenges involving multi-attribute group decision-making. However, the decision-making process is complicated due to the ambiguity over the outcomes of airport choice. The constructed frameworks are being used to solve the problem of choosing the optimal airport in Pakistan for resolving the complexity of the access to the global market in local businesses. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, parameter analysis with parameters q and (sic) is carried out. In addition, we compare our formulated approach with different aggregation operators in the literature to prove its effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, some research study conclusions are drawn, limitations are given, and future directions are revealed.

AB In mathematical modeling and decision analysis, the multipolar uncertainty is prevalent and requires specialized approaches. The theory of m-polar fuzzy (mF, in short) set is a strong extension of the fuzzy set because of its feature for dealing with multi-polar information, and robust hybrid models such as mF soft sets and interval-valued mF soft sets have emerged for significant real-life multi-criteria decision-making applications. However, these models are limited when it comes to accommodating multiple decision-makers individually in some real situations that emphasize making the use of multi-polar, multi-agent, and multi-object approaches of uncertainty. For example, in the selection of a professor, different evaluation reports are considered from more than one expert. In contrast, the soft expert set model can deal with the opinions of multiple experts about available alternatives regarding multiple attributes but fails to accommodate intervalvalued mF knowledge. Motivated by these facts, in this research study, we introduce the notion of an interval-valued mF soft expert set (IVmFSE set) model, a multiple criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach, by integrating intervalvalued m-polar fuzziness with soft expert sets. The initiated hybrid model is an expert extension of the IVmF soft sets or an interval-valued extension of the mF soft expert sets. Moreover, we discuss properties of certain unary and binary operations and relations on IVmFSE sets (the 'AND' operation, the 'OR' operation, subset-relation, equality, complement, agree- and disagree-IVmFSE sets, union, and intersection) and illustrate these operations with numerical examples. Further, we implement the proposed theory in a group decision-making problem for the fabrication of upper limb prosthesis samples to visualize its importance and significance. We also design an algorithm to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method. Finally, to validate the aptitude and novelty of the proposed theory, we give its comparative analysis with some preexisting fuzzy theories, including mF soft expert sets and fuzzy soft expert sets, by applying them to a real-world problem in which nine upper limb prosthesis samples are considered, and the computed results depict that the optimal decision alternative is x(2).

DE Massive open online courses; Dropout prediction; Feature extraction;
   Reduced order model
AB In recent years, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become the main online learning method for students all over the world, but their development has been affected by the high dropout rate for a long time. Therefore, dropout prediction is a vital task for early teaching intervention and user retention. The students' learning records are stored in MOOCs, which contain high-dimensional time series features. However, these features are hard to process, and the nonlinear relationship between the features is difficult to learn. These limitations have become obstacles to improve the performance in dropout prediction. In this paper, we propose a new neural dimension-reduced dropout prediction model based on neural network model to address the limitations. The proposed model, called CNNAE-LSTM, is constructed by convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNNAE) and long short-term memory neural network (LSTM). Specifically, CNNAE-LSTM compresses the students' learning features into a low-dimensional latent space for reconstruction through CNNAE, then projects the latent space, retains the representative features in the learning records, and finally minimizes the reconstruction error to obtain the nonlinear relationship between features and dropout. The introduced LSTM neural network can obtain the time evolution of its latent vector. Our experiments on the KDD CUP 2015 dataset and the real-world dataset XuetangX demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits better predictive performance compared to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

   alignment; Deep supervision
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become one of the most popular research topics in both academia and industry communities for their strong ability in handling irregular graph data. However, large-scale datasets are posing great challenges for deploying GNNs in edge devices with limited resources and model compression techniques have drawn considerable research attention. Existing model compression techniques such as knowledge distillation mainly focus on convolutional neural networks. Only limited attempts have been made recently for distilling knowledge from GNNs in an offline manner. As the performance of the teacher model does not necessarily improve as the number of layers increases in GNNs, selecting an appropriate teacher model will require substantial efforts. To address these challenges, we propose a novel online knowledge distillation framework called Alignahead++ in this paper. Alignahead++ transfers structure and feature information in a student layer to the previous layer of another simultaneously trained student model in an alternating training procedure. Meanwhile, to avoid over-smoothing problem in GNNs, deep supervision is employed in Alignahead++ by adding an auxiliary classifier in each intermediate layer to prevent the collapse of the node feature embeddings. Experimental results on four datasets including PPI, Cora, PubMed and CiteSeer demonstrate that the student performance is consistently boosted in our collaborative training framework without the supervision of a pre-trained teacher model and its effectiveness can generally be improved by increasing the number of students.

DE Approximate nearest neighbor search; Quantization-based approach;
   Termination conditions
AB The quantization-based approaches not only are the effective methods for solving the problems of approximate nearest neighbor search, but also effectively reduce storage space. However, many quantization-based approaches usually employ fixed nprobes to the search process for each query. This will lead to extra query consumption. Additionally, we observed that as the number of points in each cluster center of product quantization increases, the query cost also increases. To address this issue, we propose an acceleration strategy based on the IVF-HNSW framework to further speed up the query process. This strategy involves introducing an adaptive termination condition for queries and reducing the number of data points accessed by building HNSW results. Through extensive experiments, we have shown that our proposed method significantly accelerates the nearest neighbor search process.

   Framework for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Aircraft recognition; fine-grained; part parsing; remote sensing imagery
AB Aircraft recognition is crucial in both civil and military fields, and high-spatial resolution remote sensing has emerged as a practical approach. However, existing data-driven methods fail to locate discriminative regions for effective feature extraction due to limited training data, leading to poor recognition performance. To address this issue, we propose a knowledge-driven deep learning method called the explicable aircraft recognition framework based on a part parsing prior (APPEAR). APPEAR explicitly models the aircraft's rigid structure as a pixel-level part parsing prior, dividing it into five parts: 1) the nose; 2) left wing; 3) right wing; 4) fuselage; and 5) tail. This fine-grained prior provides reliable part locations to delineate aircraft architecture and imposes spatial constraints among the parts, effectively reducing the search space for model optimization and identifying subtle interclass differences. A knowledge-driven aircraft part attention (KAPA) module uses this prior to achieving a geometric-invariant representation for identifying discriminative features. Part features are generated by part indexing in a specific order and sequentially embedded into a compact space to obtain a fixed-length representation for each part, invariant to aircraft orientation and scale. The part attention module then takes the embedded part features, adaptively reweights their importance to identify discriminative parts, and aggregates them for recognition. The proposed APPEAR framework is evaluated on two aircraft recognition datasets and achieves superior performance. Moreover, experiments with few-shot learning methods demonstrate the robustness of our framework in different tasks. Ablation analysis illustrates that the fuselage and wings of the aircraft are the most effective parts for recognition.

AB This article investigates internal interaction-based dynamic learning control (LC) for uncertain discrete-time strict-feedback systems. On the basis of predict technology, the original system is converted into a common n-step-ahead input-output predict model. The predict model causes every estimated neural weight to converge to n different constants using the existing control framework. To solve such a problem, the predict model is further decomposed into n one-step-ahead subsystems, which can be viewed as n independent agents. Subsequently, the distributed cooperative weight adaptive laws are designed by introducing an undirected and connected interconnection topology among subsystems. By constructing the variable relationship between the subsystems and the n -step-ahead predict model, a new internal weight interaction-based neural dynamic LC framework is proposed for the whole closed-loop system, in which estimated weights at different times share their weight knowledge. The proposed framework ensures the ultimately uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system and achieves the excellent control performance. By combining the consensus theory and a cooperative persistent excitation condition, every estimated weight along the neural input orbit is verified to exponentially converge to a close vicinity of a unique ideal constant, rather than n different constants. Consequently, the developed LC framework facilitates constant weights storage, saves the knowledge storage space, and improves the robustness of knowledge utilization. These characteristics are verified by simulation results.

AB Due to the massive network data created by the industrial Internet of Things, tensor as the compact and multi-dimensional representation is widely employed to model the industrial network traffic. The unstable data acquisition often results in parts of entities' loss in the traffic tensor, which is conventionally solved by the tensor completion algorithms based on linear algebra and low rankness. However, due to the close correlation between domain transform and transformed sparsity, the linear domain transform cannot accurately approximate the latent nonlinear correlations which results in insufficient recovery performance. This article proposes a hybrid-structure deep model with nonlinear transform and sparse regularization to automatically search for the optimal domain transform approach and the corresponding sparse constraints. This model is in the tensor singular value decomposition framework and consists of two neural networks with different structures. One neural network has an autoencoder structure with fully connected networks to recover the lost entities only from partially observed data, and convolutional neural networks construct another one to constrain the sparsity in the transformed domain. Besides, we impose an additional Laplace constraint based on the local smoothness of the transformed tensor to overcome the continuous data loss. Inspired by the block coordinate descent algorithm, the mutually matching nonlinear transformer and sparse regularizers are trained alternatively. Extensive experimental results on industrial network traffic demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in different sampling rates and modes.

TI Guiding the retraining of convolutional neural networks against

AB Background: When using deep learning models, one of the most critical vulnerabilities is their exposure to adversarial inputs, which can cause wrong decisions (e.g., incorrect classification of an image) with minor perturbations. To address this vulnerability, it becomes necessary to retrain the affected model against adversarial inputs as part of the software testing process. In order to make this process energy efficient, data scientists need support on which are the best guidance metrics for reducing the adversarial inputs to create and use during testing, as well as optimal dataset configurations.Aim: We examined six guidance metrics for retraining deep learning models, specifically with convolutional neural network architecture, and three retraining configurations. Our goal is to improve the convolutional neural networks against the attack of adversarial inputs with regard to the accuracy, resource utilization and execution time from the point of view of a data scientist in the context of image classification.Method: We conducted an empirical study using five datasets for image classification. We explore: (a) the accuracy, resource utilization, and execution time of retraining convolutional neural networks with the guidance of six different guidance metrics (neuron coverage, likelihood-based surprise adequacy, distance -based surprise adequacy, DeepGini, softmax entropy and random), (b) the accuracy and resource utilization of retraining convolutional neural networks with three different configurations (one-step adversarial retraining, adversarial retraining and adversarial fine-tuning). Results: We reveal that adversarial retraining from original model weights, and by ordering with uncertainty metrics, gives the best model w.r.t. accuracy, resource utilization, and execution time. Conclusions: Although more studies are necessary, we recommend data scientists use the above configuration and metrics to deal with the vulnerability to adversarial inputs of deep learning models, as they can improve their models against adversarial inputs without using many inputs and without creating numerous adversarial inputs. We also show that dataset size has an important impact on the results.

AB Oral English instruction plays a pivotal role in educational endeavors. The emergence of online teaching in response to the epidemic has created an urgent demand for a methodology to evaluate and monitor oral English instruction. In the post-epidemic era, distance learning has become indispensable for educational pursuits. Given the distinct teaching modality and approach of oral English instruction, it is imperative to explore an intelligent scoring technique that can effectively oversee the content of English teaching. With this objective in mind, we have devised a scoring approach for oral English instruction based on multi-modal perception utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT). Initially, a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model is employed to extract and quantify visual information and audio features from the IoT, reducing them to a fixed dimension. Subsequently, an external attention model is proposed to compute spoken English and image characteristics. Lastly, the content of English instruction is classified and graded based on the quantitative attributes of oral dialogue. Our findings illustrate that our scoring model for oral English instruction surpasses others, achieving the highest rankings and an accuracy of 88.8%, outperforming others by more than 2%.

AB The U-Net architecture is a prominent technique for image segmentation. However, a significant challenge in utilizing this algorithm is the selection of appropriate hyperpa-rameters. In this study, we aimed to address this issue using an evolutionary approach. We conducted experiments on four different geometric datasets (triangle, kite, paral-lelogram, and square), with 1,000 training samples and 200 test samples. Initially, we performed image segmentation without the evolutionary approach, manually adjusting the U-Net hyperparameters. The average accuracy rates for the geometric images were 0.94463, 0.96289, 0.96962, and 0.93971, respectively. Subsequently, we proposed a hybrid version of the U-Net architecture, incorporating the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) for an evolutionary approach. This method automatically discovered the optimal hyperparameters, resulting in improved image segmentation performance. The average accuracy rates achieved by the proposed method were 0.99418, 0.99673, 0.99143, and 0.99946, respectively, for the geometric images. Comparative analysis revealed that the proposed UNet-GOA approach outperformed the traditional U-Net architecture, yielding higher accuracy rates.

AB Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important information for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) diagnosis. In recent year, several dry electrode-based smart clothes have been widely developed to improve the skin allergic reaction and gel-drying issue from conventional Ag/AgCl electrode under long-term measurement. However, most of these dry electrodes still have to contact with skin and may encounter the risk of skin irritation, and many smart clothing systems lack of automatic CVDs detection. In this article, a novel smart clothing was designed to automatically detect CVDs in daily life. Based on the technique of capacitive electrodes, the proposed smart clothing could access the bio-potential across the clothes to prevent the skin from irritation and discomfort, and could adapt to different body sizes by the specific belt mechanical design. Moreover, the CVDs detection algorithm was also designed and implemented in the field programmable gate array (FPGA) based ECG analysis module. The experiment results show that the proposed smart clothing could effectively real-time extract ECG features (P-, R-, and T-waves) and detect CVDs state via the front-end circuit, including bradycardia, tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, left ventricular hypertrophy, first-degree atrioventricular block, and hyperkalemia. The proposed FPGA architecture is also beneficial for future revisions or additions of CVD algorithms to improve more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of heart disease. It might reduce huge ECG data collected in daily life via only transmitting the abnormal ECG segment, and improve the diagnostic efficiency of CVDs in the future.

AB As large-scale time-series data can easily be found in real-world applications, multivariate time-series anomaly detection has played an essential role in diverse industries. It enables productivity improvement and maintenance cost reduction by preventing malfunctions and detecting anomalies based on time-series data. However, multivariate time-series anomaly detection is challenging because real-world time-series data exhibit complex temporal dependencies. For this task, it is crucial to learn a rich representation that effectively contains the nonlinear temporal dynamics of normal behavior. In this study, we propose an unsupervised multivariate time-series anomaly detection model named RAE-MEPC which learns informative normal representations based on multi-resolution ensemble reconstruction and predictive coding. We introduce multi-resolution ensemble encoding to capture the multi-scale dependency from the input time series. The encoder hierarchically aggregates the multi-scale temporal features extracted from the sub-encoders with different encoding lengths. From these encoded features, the reconstruction decoder reconstructs the input time series based on multi-resolution ensemble decoding where lower-resolution information helps to decode sub-decoders with higher-resolution outputs. Predictive coding is further introduced to encourage the model to learn more temporal dependencies of the time series. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms the benchmark models for multivariate time-series anomaly detection.

AB Software recommendations play a crucial role in helping developers discover potential functional requirements and improve development efficiencies. As new requirements emerge in the software development process, developers' preferences tend to change over time and social relationships. However, the existing works fall short of capturing the evolution of developers' interests. To overcome these problems, evolving software recommendation with time-sliced social and behavioral information is proposed for capturing the dynamic interests of developers. Specifically, the different behaviors of developers are considered and graph structure features on projects are extracted by gated graph neural networks. Then, the graph attention networks are introduced to model rich developer-project interactions and social aggregation. Finally, the integration of time-sliced representations on the developer and project sides is employed through gated recurrent units to capture the dynamic interests of developers. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over representative baseline methods across various evaluation metrics.

AB In many industrial or healthcare contexts, keeping track of the number of people is essential. Radar systems, with their low overall cost and power consumption, enable privacy-friendly monitoring in many use cases. Yet, radar data are hard to interpret and incompatible with most computer vision strategies. Many current deep learning-based systems achieve high monitoring performance but are strongly context-dependent. In this work, we show how context generalization approaches can let the monitoring system fit unseen radar scenarios without adaptation steps. We collect data via a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave in three office rooms with up to three people and preprocess them in the frequency domain. Then, using meta learning, specifically the Weighting-Injection Net, we generate relationship scores between the few training datasets and query data. We further present an optimization-based approach coupled with weighting networks that can increase the training stability when only very few training examples are available. Finally, we use pool-based sampling active learning to fine-tune the model in new scenarios, labeling only the most uncertain data. Without adaptation needs, we achieve over 80% and 70% accuracy by testing the meta learning algorithms in new radar positions and a new office, respectively.

AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are gaining attraction in large cities for better traffic management. Traffic forecasting is an important part of ITS, but a difficult one due to the intricate spatiotemporal relationships of traffic between different locations. Despite the fact that remote or far sensors may have temporal and spatial similarities with the predicting sensor, existing traffic forecasting research focuses primarily on modeling correlations between neighboring sensors while disregarding correlations between remote sensors. Furthermore, existing methods for capturing spatial dependencies, such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), are unable to capture the dynamic spatial dependence in traffic systems. Self-attention-based techniques for modeling dynamic correlations of all sensors currently in use overlook the hierarchical features of roads and have quadratic computational complexity. Our paper presents a new Dynamic Graph Convolution LSTM Network (DyGCN-LSTM) to address the aforementioned limitations. The novelty of DyGCN-LSTM is that it can model the underlying non-linear spatial and temporal correlations of remotely located sensors at the same time. Experimental investigations conducted using four real-world traffic data sets show that the suggested approach is superior to state-of-the-art benchmarks by 25% in terms of RMSE.

ID UNIFIED FRAMEWORK
AB Visual recognition has become inevitable in applications such as object detection, biometric tracking, autonomous vehicles, and social media platforms. The images have multiple factors such as image resolution, illumination, perspective and noise, resulting in a significant mismatch between the training and testing domains. Unsupervised Domain adaptation (DA) has proven an effective way to reduce the differences by adapting the knowledge from a richly labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. But the real-time datasets are non-linear and high-dimensional. Though kernelization can handle the non-linearity in data, the dimension needs to be reduced as the salient features of the data lie in a low-dimensional subspace. Current dimensionality reduction approaches in DA preserve either the global or local part of information of manifold data. Specifically, the data manifold's static (subject-invariant) and dynamic (intra-subject variant) information need to be considered during knowledge transfer. Therefore, to preserve both parts of information Globality-Locality Preserving Projection (GLPP) method is applied to the labeled source domain. The other objectives are preserving the discriminant information and variance of target data, and minimizing the distribution and subspace differences between the domains. With all these objectives, we propose a unique method known as Kernelized Global-Local Discriminant Information Preservation for unsupervised DA (KGLDIP). KGLDIP aims to reduce the discrimination discrepancy geometrically and statistically between the two domains after calculating two projection matrices for each domain. Intensive experiments are conducted using five standard datasets and the analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm excels the other state-of-the-art DA approaches.

AB Improve the scientific level of the goose breeding industry and help the development of intelligent agriculture. Instance Segmentation has a pivotal role when the breeders make decisions about geese breeding. It can be used for disease prevention, body size estimation and behavioural prediction, etc. However, instance segmentation requires high performance computing devices to run smoothly due to its rich output. To ameliorate this problem, this paper constructs a novel encoder-decoder module and proposes the SDSCNet model. The reasonable use of depth-separable convolution in the module reduces the number and size of model parameters and increase execution speed. Finally, SDSCNet model enables real-time identification and segmentation of individual geese with the accuracy reached 0.933.We compare this model with numerous mainstream instance segmentation models, and the final results demonstrate the excellent performance of our model.Furthermore, deploying SDSCNet model on the embedded device Raspberry Pi 4 Model B can achieve effective detection of continuous moving scenes.

DE Similarity measurement; Multivariate time series; Dynamic multi-factor;
   Stock prediction
ID ALGORITHM
AB Similarity measurement takes on critical significance in strategies that seek similar stocks based on historical data to make predictions. Stock data refers to a multidimensional time series with features of non-linearity and high noise, posing a challenge to the practical design of similarity measurement. However, the existing similarity measurements cannot better address the negative effects of the singularity of data and correlations of data in multidimensional stock price series, such that the performance of stock prediction will be reduced. In this study, a novel method named dynamic multi-factor similarity measurement (DMFSM) is proposed to accurately describe the similarity between a pair of multidimensional time series. DMFSM is capable of eliminating effects exerted by singularity and correlations of data using dynamic time warping (DTW) with Mahalanobis distance embedded and weights of series nodes in multidimensional time series. To validate the efficiency of DMFSM, several experiments were performed on a total of 675 stocks, which comprised 290 stocks from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, 285 stocks from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, as well as 100 stocks from the Growth Enterprise Market of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The experiment results for mean absolute error of predictions indicated that DMFSM (0.018) outperformed similarity measurements (e.g., Euclidean distance (0.023), DTW (0.054), and dynamic multi-perspective personalized similarity measurement (0.023)).

ID COLOR; TRANSFORM; SCHEME
AB For digital image copyright protection, watermarking techniques are a promising solution and are of interest to many researchers. In watermarking schemes based on matrix transformation, the embedding element and embedding formula play a very important role in maintaining the quality of a watermark image and the robustness of the watermark. In this paper, a blind image watermarking scheme based on Hessenberg decomposition, where the improvement focuses on the embedding element and embedding formula, is proposed. First, the structure of the Hessenberg factorization is analysed to obtain the most suitable embedding element. Accordingly, this is the first time that the element on the second row and the second column of the upper Hessenberg matrix is selected as an embedding element in a Hessenberg-based image watermarking scheme because of its energy concentration and stability. Second, an improved embedding formula is proposed to address the limitations of previous studies. In the proposed formula, constraint conditions are added to limit the change in all blocks, and a scaling factor is applied to guarantee a trade-off between invisibility and robustness. Here, the scaling factor is carefully calculated by repeating various experiments under different image attacks to achieve an optimal value. Therefore, our proposed embedding formula not only minimizes the modification of the host image after embedding but also helps maintain the robustness of the extracted watermark. Third, to increase the security of the proposed scheme, the watermark image is encoded by the Arnold transform before it is embedded into the host image. The experimental results show that the proposed approach defeats the compared methods in terms of invisibility and execution time. Moreover, the proposed scheme can resist most common attacks when the average normalized correlation value is higher than 0.93 and the extracted watermarks are always clearly recognized.

AB This article proposes an asynchronous and dynamic event-based sliding mode control strategy to efficiently address the synchronization problem of Markov jump neural networks. By designing an adaptive law, and a triggered threshold in the form of a diagonal matrix, a special dynamic event-triggered scheme is applied to send the control signals only at triggered moments. An asynchronous sliding mode controller with gain uncertainty is designed by constructing a specified sliding manifold. Then, linear matrix inequalities are used to represent sufficient conditions for guaranteeing system synchronization. The error system trajectories are pushed onto the sliding surface by the controller. Eventually, the availability of the presented control strategy is demonstrated by an illustrative example.

AB Generalized possibility Kripke structure (GPKS) plays a key role in modeling fuzzy systems for possibilistic model checking. However, it is unrealistic, in practice, to produce manually a large number of fuzzy states of GPKSs and transition relations over states space. In this article, we develop an online supervised learning algorithm for GPKS to learn its fuzzy states and possibilistic transition matrix. We assume that true fuzzy states of GPKSs are unknown, only available knowledge is the external (sensor's) variables that have ambiguous connections with the states. We connect the sensor's variables to the atomic propositions used to describe the fuzzy states through a family of (Gaussian) fuzzy functions. The first GPKS's learning model is called the GPKS with Fuzzifier Sets (GPKS-FS) that consists of a standard GPKS and a group of fuzzy functions that connect model's states to different sensor variables. The learning algorithm based on stochastic gradient descent is derived to learn all parameters of the (Gaussian) fuzzy functions and all elements of atomic propositions evolution matrix used to explain mechanism of transition between system's states. Based on the evolution matrix, we propose a method of constructing the similarity-based possibilistic transition matrix. This produces the possibilistic transition matrix which is critical for model checking over GPKSs. The learning algorithm do not rely on any subjective information from humans and remove a significant bottleneck for modeling of possibilistic model checking. Computer simulation results showing learning performance.

AB This paper presents a groundbreaking approach to enhance the performance of a vehicle cruise control system-a crucial aspect of road safety. The work offers two key contributions. Firstly, a state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithm is proposed by augmenting the performance of the weighted mean of vectors (INFO) algorithm using pattern search and elite opposition-based learning mechanisms. The resulting boosted INFO (b-INFO) algorithm surpasses the original INFO, marine predators, and gravitational search algorithms in terms of performance on benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed-dimensional multimodal functions. Secondly, a novel proportional, fractional order integral, derivative plus double derivative with filter ((PIDNDN2)-D-?-N-2) controller is proposed as a more efficient control structure for vehicle cruise control systems. An objective function is utilized to determine the optimal values for the controller parameters, and the proposed method's performance is compared against a range of recent approaches. Results demonstrate that the b-INFO algorithm-based (PIDNDN2)-D-?-N-2 controller is the most efficient and superior method for controlling a vehicle cruise control system. Moreo-ver, this work represents the first report of a (PIDNDN2)-D-?-N-2 controller's implementation for vehicle cruise control systems, underscoring the novelty and significance of this research. The proposed method's exceptional ability is further confirmed by comparisons with the genetic algorithm, ant lion optimizer, atom search optimizer, arithmetic optimization algorithm, slime mold algorithm, L & eacute;vy flight distribution algorithm, manta ray foraging optimization, and hunger games search-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID), along with Harris hawks optimization-based PID and fractional order PID control-lers.

AB Defect detection is an essential way to ensure the quality of parts made by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) and industrial cameras are one of the commonly used tools for defect monitoring. Different lighting environments affect the visibility of defects in the images, and the illumination condition becomes one of the most important factors affecting the defect detection effect of industrial cameras, but the modification of the equipment lighting environment will increase the complexity and cost of monitoring. In this study, only an off-axis CMOS camera monitoring system is used and the lighting facilities are not changed to improve the effect of defect detection under uneven lighting conditions. A dual-input convolutional neural network fusing defect parameter vectors and layerwise images is proposed for real-time online monitoring of defects in the LPBF process using a paraxial CMOS camera monitoring system. The model integrates the image and the parameter information related to defect generation, and can distinguish some defects that are not easily discerned by images alone. To a certain extent, it avoids the problem that the same defects are visually indistinguishable in images caused by uneven light distribution and reflections on metal surfaces. The results indicate that the method has better performance than the method with a single image input, with recognition accuracies above 80.00% for all defect categories. In addition, the method is more suitable for real-time online monitoring scenarios due to its low parameter number, short training time and fast prediction speed compared to classical deep learning algorithms.

DE Adversarial examples; Audio visual deception; Contextualized generation;
   Fluency
AB The generation methods of adversarial examples have been more explored on English data, while the research papers on Chinese adversarial examples are very limited. At the same time, the existing Chinese adversarial attack methods are often characterized by a single form of generation and not rich enough expression. And the attack effect of these methods still has room for improvement. Therefore, this paper proposes SentiAttack, a method to introduce 6 perturbations from two perspectives, according to the characteristics of Chinese. The 6 types of perturbation were obtained from both audiovisual deception (words with similar sound, Chinese characters with similar form, horizontal splitting of Chinese character and reverse order of adjacent Chinese characters within word) and contextualized generation (WoBERT-MLM (Su in Wobert: Word-based chinese bert model - zhuiyiai. Technical report, 2020. ) word generation and LongLM (Guan et al. in Trans Assoc Comput Linguist 10:434-451, 2022. ) sentence-piece generation), respectively. In addition, a "fluency" metric is added to further measure the quality of the adversarial examples. We conducted experiments on five datasets (CH-SIMS 3, ChnSentiCorp, online shopping, waimai, and weibo8). With the effective constraints of semantic similarity, expression fluency and perturbation, we obtained 74.40%, 49.10%, 42.90%, 39.90% and 66.20% accuracy decrease, respectively.

AB Steganalysis is a known practice to detect hidden secrecy within covered e-media. Researches claimed obscured detection attainability via features extraction, as for perceiving concealed data within images. This paper verifies practicality of the claim by testing investigation of a steganalysis system that depicts the existence of hidden data focused on statistical features of color images using artificial neural network techniques. The proposed system is built to work for blind image steganalysis representing common security as looked for the most. The work experimentations adopted common steganography techniques to create the stego images for our intended steganalysis challenging practicality evaluation. The study involved machine learning radial basis function and naive bayes classifiers to sort the remarks improving discovery accuracy. From the investigational results, the proposed system exemplified reliability and enhancements in the recognition rate for most steganographic methods showing attractive annotations. Further, the correlation features displayed increased correctness showing reliable convalescing practicality overcoming many previous steganalysis defects.

AB Hyper-heuristic is a crucial answer to how problem-specific heuristics can be selected or generated automatically for solving different optimization problems. However, selecting a low-level heuristics algorithm has complicated designing for the efficient hyper-heuristic algorithm. This paper presents a new design of a hyper-heuristic (NHH) algorithm to address this limitation. In NHH, the population is divided into two different types of individuals. The first group is explorative, while the second group is exploitative. The NHH incorporates three components, which are a hybrid vector-based operator, an adaptive selection operator and a behavioral schema. In the hybrid vector-based operator, four low-level operators with different characteristics are incorporated which are divided into two groups explorative or exploitative operators. It enables NHH to apply different search strategies during the optimization process. An adaptive selection operator which is called an adaptive selection based on the individual situation (ASIS), assigns one of the four operators of hybrid vector-based operator to each individual based on their role (explorative and exploitative) and simplified Q-learning. The NHH's behavioral schema is developed inspired by the human social behavioral schema. This supportive operator includes progress, hard-working, adventure, and changing. Individuals adopt them during the search process which helps the algorithm to better execute different problems. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 35 well-known benchmark functions and CEC 2017 test suite. The performance comparison with the other comparative 11 algorithms verified the reliability of the proposed algorithm.

AB The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is an effective algorithm for solving optimization problems with separable structures. Recently, inertial technique has been widely used in various algorithms to accelerate its convergence speed and enhance the numerical performance. There are a lot of convergence analyses for solving the convex optimization problems by combining inertial technique with ADMM, while the research on the nonconvex cases is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose an algorithm framework of inertial regularized ADMM (iRADMM) for a class of two-block nonconvex optimization problems. Under some assumptions, we establish the subsequential and global convergence of the proposed method. Furthermore, we apply the iRADMM to solve the signal recovery, image reconstruction and SCAD penalty problem. The numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the iRADMM algorithm and also illustrate the effectiveness of the introduced inertial term.

AB Learning visual predictive models has great potential for real-world robot manipulations. Visual predictive models serve as a model of real-world dynamics to comprehend the interactions between the robot and objects. However, prior works in the literature have focused mainly on low-level elementary robot actions, which typically result in lengthy, inefficient, and highly complex robot manipulation. In contrast, humans usually employ top-down thinking of high-level actions rather than bottom-up stacking of low-level ones. To address this limitation, we present a novel formulation for robot manipulation that can be accomplished by pick-and-place, a commonly applied high-level robot action, through grasping. We propose a novel visual predictive model that combines an action decomposer and a video prediction network to learn the intrinsic semantic information of high-level actions. Experiments show that our model can accurately predict the object dynamics (i.e., the object movements under robot manipulation) while trained directly on observations of high-level pick-and-place actions. We also demonstrate that, together with a sampling-based planner, our model achieves a higher success rate using high-level actions on a variety of real robot manipulation tasks.

AB This paper deals with a reentrant hybrid flow shop problem with sequence-dependent setup time and limited buffers where there are multiple unrelated parallel machines at each stage. A mathematical model with the minimization of total weighted completion time is constructed for this problem. Considering the complexity of the problem at hand, an effective cooperative adaptive genetic algorithm (CAGA) is proposed. In the algorithm, a dual chain coding scheme and a staged-hierarchical decoding approach are, respectively, designed to encode and decode each solution. Six dispatch heuristics and a dynamic adjustment method are introduced to define initial population. To balance the exploration and exploitation abilities, three effective operations are implemented: (1) two new crossover and mutation operators with collaborative mechanism are imposed on genetic algorithm; (2) an adaptive adjustment strategy is introduced to re-optimize better solutions after mutation operations, where ant colony search algorithm and modified greedy heuristic are intelligently switched; (3) a reset strategy with dynamic variable step strategy is embedded to re-generate some non-improved solutions. A Taguchi method of design of experiment is adopted to calibrate the parameter values in the presented algorithm. Comparison experiments are executed on test instances with different scale problems. Computational results show that the proposed CAGA is more effective and efficient than several well-known algorithms in solving the studied problem.

AB Expert systems are being extensively used to make critical decisions involving emotional analysis in affective computing. The evolution of deep learning algorithms has improved the potential for extracting value from multimodal emotional data. However, these black-box algorithms do not often explain the heuristics behind processing the input features for achieving certain outputs. This study focuses on the risks of using black-box deep learning models for critical tasks, such as emotion recognition, and describes how human understandable interpretations of the workings of these models are extremely important. This study utilizes one of the largest multimodal datasets available-CMU-MOSEI. Many researchers have used the pre-extracted features provided by the CMU Multimodal SDK with black-box deep learning models making it difficult to interpret the contribution of its individual features. This study describes the implications of significant features from various modalities (audio, video, text) identified using XAI in Multimodal Emotion Recognition. It describes the process of curating reduced feature models by using the Gradient SHAP XAI method. These reduced models with highly contributing features achieve comparable and at times even better results compared to their corresponding all-feature models as well as the baseline model GraphMFN. This study reveals that carefully selecting significant features for a model can help filter out irrelevant features, and attenuate the noise or bias caused by them, leading to an improved performance efficiency of the expert systems by making them transparent, easily interpretable, and trustworthy.

AB Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of death in women in developing nations like India. The automated cervical cancer screening systems play a critical role in diagnosing the ailment at an early stage. They can also assist in routine cervical cancer screening and decision-making processes. The underlying binary classifier for detecting cancerous cells is necessary for building computerized screening systems. Thus, this work aims to develop a robust binary classifier capable of classifying single cervical cells as normal and cancerous. The current work aims to improvise the EfficientNet-B7 with empirical resolution parameters and skilful consolidation of the outcomes of the inner layers using the global pooling layer to improve the binary classification result. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on three independent pap smear datasets. The class activation heatmap visualizes the classification model for better interpretability. The performance of the autonomous classification tasks indicates that the deep learning-based binary classifier is robust in classifying cancerous cells as it achieves accuracy of 94% on Herlev Dataset which is 2% higher than the other state-of-the-art methods and comparable accuracy of nearly 99% on other cervical cell datasets using the proposed methodology.

ID COMPONENT ANALYSIS
AB Although low-rank representation (LRR)-based subspace learning has been widely applied for feature extraction in computer vision, how to enhance the discriminability of the low-dimensional features extracted by LRR based subspace learning methods is still a problem that needs to be further investigated. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel low-rank preserving embedding regression (LRPER) method by integrating LRR, linear regression, and projection learning into a unified framework. In LRPER, LRR can reveal the underlying structure information to strengthen the robustness of projection learning. The robust metric L-2,L-1-norm is employed to measure the low-rank reconstruction error and regression loss for moulding the noise and occlusions. An embedding regression is proposed to make full use of the prior information for improving the discriminability of the learned projection. In addition, an alternative iteration algorithm is designed to optimise the proposed model, and the computational complexity of the optimisation algorithm is briefly analysed. The convergence of the optimisation algorithm is theoretically and numerically studied. At last, extensive experiments on four types of image datasets are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of LRPER, and the experimental results demonstrate that LRPER performs better than some state-of-the-art feature extraction methods.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB As the popularity of wireless networks deepens, the diversity of device types and hardware environments makes network data take on heterogeneous forms while the threat of malicious attacks from outside can prevent ordinary methods from mining information from abnormal data. In view of this, the research will be devoted to the feature processing of the anomalous data itself, and the convolutional operation of the anomalous information by the convolutional neural network (CNN). This is to extract the internal information. In the first step of the cascaded CNNs, the dimensions of the anomaly data will be processed, the anomaly data will be sorted under the concept of relevance grouping, and then the sorted results will be added to the convolution and pooling. The performance test uses three datasets with different feature capacities as the attack sources, and the results show a 13.22% improvement in information mining performance compared to the standard CNN. The extended CNN step will perform feature identification for homologous or similar network threats, with feature expansion within the convolutional layer first, and then pooling to reduce the computational cost. The test results show that when the maximum value domain of linear expansion is 2, the model has the best feature recognition performance, fluctuating around 85%; The model comparison test results show that the accuracy of the extended CNN is higher than that of the standard CNN, and the model stability is better than that of the back propagation (BP) neural network. This indicates that the cascaded CNN dual module can mine for the data itself, thus ignoring the risk unknowns, and this connected CNN has some practical significance. The proposed cascaded CNN module applies advanced neural network technology to identify internal and external risk data. The research content has important reference value for the security management of IoT systems.

AB Food price forecasts in the agricultural sector have always been a vital matter to a wide variety of market participants. In this work, we approach this forecast problem for the weekly wholesale food price index in the Chinese market during a 10-year period of January 1, 2010-January 3, 2020. To facilitate the analysis, we propose the use of the nonlinear auto-regressive neural network. Technically, we investigate forecast performance, based upon the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) as the evaluation metrics, corresponding to one hundred and twenty settings that cover different algorithms for model estimations, numbers of hidden neurons and delays, and ratios for splitting the data. Our experimental result suggests the construction of the neural network with three delays and 10 hidden neurons, which is trained through the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as the forecast model. It leads to high accuracy and stabilities with the RRMSEs of 1.93% for the training phase, 2.16% for the validation phase, and 1.95% for the testing phase. Comparisons of forecast accuracy between the proposed model and some other machine learning models, as well as traditional time-series econometric models, suggest that our proposed model leads to statistically significant better performance. Our results could benefit different forecast users, such as policymakers and various market participants, in policy analysis and market assessments.

AB Optimizing order-picking systems (OPSs) while considering human factors and integrating key decisions is a major challenge for warehouse managers. This study presents a two-stage framework based on multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) and multi-objective decision-making (MODM) models to integrate decisions on picker selection, order batching, batch assignment, picker routing, and scheduling. In the first stage, the human factors affecting picker selection are considered as the problem's criteria and the available pickers are treated as alternatives. The fuzzy entropy method and fuzzy COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) are used to weight the factors and rank the pickers, respectively. In the second stage, a three-objective mathematical model is formulated to minimize makespan and the operating costs of picking while maximizing the total scores of the selected pickers. The improved augmented epsilon constraint method (AUGMECON2) and the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) are applied to solve the proposed model. The performance of the two methods is tested on well-known benchmark instances and a real-world case study. The NSGA-II algorithm can generate optimal results using only about 6.58% of the CPU time required by AUGMECON2 to solve the problem. Our computational experiments show that increasing the number of pickers from 2 to 8 and doubling their capacity reduces the makespan by 2.61% and 2.74%, respectively.

AB Group interactions are prevalent in a variety of areas. Many of them, including email exchanges, chemical reactions, and bitcoin transactions, are directional, and thus they are naturally modeled as directed hypergraphs, where each hyperarc consists of the set of source nodes and the set of destination nodes. For directed graphs, which are a special case of directed hypergraphs, reciprocity has played a key role as a fundamental graph statistic in revealing organizing principles of graphs and in solving graph learning tasks. For general directed hypergraphs, however, even no systematic measure of reciprocity has been developed. In this work, we investigate the reciprocity of 11 real-world hypergraphs. To this end, we first introduce eight axioms that any reasonable measure of reciprocity should satisfy. Second, we propose HyperRec, a family of principled measures of hypergraph reciprocity that satisfy all the axioms. Third, we develop FastHyperRec, a fast and exact algorithm for computing the measures. Fourth, using them, we examine 11 real-world hypergraphs and discover patterns that distinguish them from random hypergraphs. Lastly, we propose ReDi, an intuitive generative model for directed hypergraphs exhibiting the patterns.

   hypergraph analysis
AB Hypergraphs are a powerful abstraction for modeling high-order relations, which are ubiquitous in many fields. A hypergraph consists of nodes and hyperedges (i.e., subsets of nodes); and there have been a number of attempts to extend the notion of k-cores, which proved useful with numerous applications for pairwise graphs, to hypergraphs. However, the previous extensions are based on an unrealistic assumption that hyperedges are fragile, i.e., a high-order relation becomes obsolete as soon as a single member leaves it.In this work, we propose a new substructure model, called (k, t)-hypercore, based on the assumption that high-order relations remain as long as at least t fraction of the members remains. Specifically, it is defined as the maximal subhypergraph where (1) every node is contained in at least k hyperedges in it and (2) at least t fraction of the nodes remain in every hyperedge. We first prove that, given t (or k ), finding the (k,t)-hypercore for every possible k (or t ) can be computed in time linear w.r.t the sum of the sizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world hypergraphs from the same domain share similar (k, t)-hypercore structures, which capture different perspectives depending on t. Lastly, we show the successful applications of our model in identifying influential nodes, dense substructures, and vulnerability in hypergraphs.

TI Pyramid Attention Network for Image Restoration

DT Article
DE Image restoration; Image denoising; Demosaicing; Compression artifact
   reduction; Super-resolution
AB Self-similarity refers to the image prior widely used in image restoration algorithms that small but similar patterns tend to occur at different locations and scales. However, recent advanced deep convolutional neural network-based methods for image restoration do not take full advantage of self-similarities by relying on self-attention neural modules that only process information at the same scale. To solve this problem, we present a novel Pyramid Attention module for image restoration, which captures long-range feature correspondences from a multi-scale feature pyramid. Inspired by the fact that corruptions, such as noise or compression artifacts, drop drastically at coarser image scales, our attention module is designed to be able to borrow clean signals from their "clean" correspondences at the coarser levels. The proposed pyramid attention module is a generic building block that can be flexibly integrated into various neural architectures. Its effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks: image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifact reduction, and super resolution. Without any bells and whistles, our PANet (pyramid attention module with simple network backbones) can produce state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and visual quality.

ID OBJECT REMOVAL; ALGORITHM
AB This paper presents a brand-new Thanka picture inpainting technique based on Euler's elastica, iterative denoising, and backward projections (EEIDBP). Specifically, a model of Euler's elastica is introduced to estimate the original observation due to its lower staircasing effects and better approximation of natural images. A method for backward projection and iterative denoising is applied to achieve a more accurate estimate of the original signal by alternating iterations between the estimation of the original signal and the estimation of the original observation. The experimental findings demonstrate that, in terms of a subjective assessment, the quantitative peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and the structural similarity (SSIM), the proposed technique outperforms the state-of-the-art picture inpainting methods.

ID ERP COMPONENTS; CLASSIFICATION
AB Under certain task conditions, error-related potential (ErrP) will be elicited, meaning that the subject is perceiving an error, responding to an external error, or engaging in a cognitive process of reinforcement learning. The detection of ErrP on a single trial basis has been studied and applied to improve all kinds of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, the performance of this kind of detection is not currently good enough. In the paper, we proposed a novel method, called window-adjusted common spatial pattern (WACSP), for detecting ErrP in P300 BCI. In this method, the coefficient of determination was introduced to measure the difference of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals on a channel at a moment and to guide the search of time windows in which EEG differences are significant, and common spatial pattern (CSP) was further used to capture the stable spatial patterns of EEG differences between correct and incorrect responses in each time window. WACSP and the commonly used methods were tested on the data sets that were built using the EEG signals acquired during the P300 BCI experiments with different feedback. The comparisons of accuracy, area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and F-measure show that WACSP significantly outperforms the commonly used methods. The proposed method can improve ErrP detection based on a single trial.

AB There is a parameter ubiquitous throughout the deep learning world: learning rate. There is likewise a ubiquitous question: what should that learning rate be? The true answer to this question is often tedious and time consuming to obtain, and a great deal of arcane knowledge has accumulated in recent years over how to pick and modify learning rates to achieve optimal training performance. Moreover, the long hours spent carefully crafting the perfect learning rate can come to nothing the moment your network architecture, optimizer, dataset, or initial conditions change ever so slightly. But it need not be this way. We propose a new answer to the great learning rate question: the Autonomous Learning Rate Controller.

This method combines lyrics and comment texts to mine richer sentiment information, and comprehensively considers the influence of the word frequency, sentiment strength and part of speech of sentiment words on sentiment classification when constructing sentiment vectors. Moreover, it matches the lyrics of the music and the substantive words in the comment with the emotional dictionary to obtain the emotional category and emotional weight of each substantive word, and calculates the statistical value of each emotional category. In addition, this paper combines reinforcement learning and multi-modal information technology to construct a music emotion research model.

AB The recent decade has seen an explosion in the e-commerce industry with the support of modern technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) to maximize conversion rates. Many recommendation systems, therefore, have been developed to predict the customer behaviors to take appropriate actions. Customization of promotions or items for distinct groups of online customers considerably contributes to enhancing the sales. The purchasing records are essential information that can be used to investigate the customer behaviors. These kinds of information, however, are mainly expressed in tubular forms. Several computational models were developed using conventional machine learning algorithms to deal with that data type. However, these approaches struggle with large-volume and high-dimensional data, feature engineering, and high computational cost. In our study, we propose a deep learning model based on the Feature Tokenizer Transformer architecture to predict the customer purchasing intention. This novel architecture is a simplified adaptive version of the Transformer tabular data. The results demonstrated that our model showed better performance compared to conventional machine learning models. Furthermore, the model's stability was also confirmed by the results of multiple repeated experiments.

An augmented system, which can control BNs with a minimal cost function, is established through a model transformation based on the semi-tensor product of matrices and the Exclusive-Or operator. Then the optimal preview controller that is equipped with various features such as state feedback, integrator, and preview feedforward is given for BNs. Finally, we present a numerical example to illustrate the validity of the proposed optimal preview controller of BNs.

AB The routing optimization for medical waste collection severely affects the efficiency and safety of medical waste disposal. The infectivity of medical waste exacerbates the potential impact of incidents, and the large amount of medical waste has given birth to the practical operation of multiple disposal centers. A definition of infectious risk related to the infectious process after an incident and the final infected population is proposed. With the consideration of multiple disposal centers and catastrophe avoidance, a bi-objective routing optimization model for medical waste collection is developed based on two-commodity formulation, minimizing the maximum infectious risk and transport cost simultaneously. An e-constraint method incorporating weighting is proposed, which can obtain the entire Pareto front and incorporates an improved solution process. A fast approximation approach is proposed for solving large-scale instances efficiently. Finally, the proposed solution method is tested by numerical instance, and some managerial insights are given through sensitivity analysis.

AB In this paper, we propose a method of protecting a device from being identified with the images captured by it. This method can suppress the device-related fingerprint, i.e., PRNU, in an image via modifying it in the domain of integer wavelet transform. In addition, we embed the suppressed PRNU into the image using reversible data hiding to achieve a perfect recovery of the original image. This is beneficial to solve the problems of device privacy leakage and terminal server identity authentication. Extensive experiments on MICHE-I and VISION datasets show that the proposed method makes up for the shortcomings of existing techniques and has strong scalability.

   Overlapping community detection
ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; FUZZY
AB In complex networks, there are a huge number of overlapping community structures, and those structures have been an increasing concern in recent years. The label propagation algorithm (LPA) family is a kind of mainstream method that discovers different community structures in complex networks. But these methods often struggle with stability and feasibility, as well as issues sensitive to network size. In this paper, to solve the above problems and improve the detection accuracy, we present a fast label propagation algorithm (FLPA) based on node influence and label weight. In FLPA, we first use the graph compression technique to reduce the network size. Then, we propose a new node influence calculation method and fuse it with the ������-path similarity to precisely control the label weight in the label propagation stage. Through the above process, FLPA makes the labels that are propagated and received by nodes more reasonable and further improves the detection accuracy. Finally, we restore the network and make the compressed node belong to the same community as its corresponding super node. Experimental results on 10 real and 58 synthetic networks indicate that FLPA is suitable for detecting overlapping community structures regardless of network scale and accomplishes better than state-of-the-art methods on stability and feasibility.

AB We investigate a general optimization problem with a linear objective in which the coefficients are uncertain and the uncertainty is represented by a belief function. We consider five common criteria to compare solutions in this setting: generalized Hurwicz, strong dominance, weak dominance, maximality and E-admissibility. We provide characterizations for the non-dominated solutions with respect to these criteria when the focal sets of the belief function are Cartesian products of compact sets. These characterizations correspond to established concepts in optimization. They make it possible to find non-dominated solutions by solving known variants of the deterministic version of the optimization problem or even, in some cases, simply by solving the deterministic version.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is rapidly impacting the intelligent machines sector - on space missions, large agriculture equipment, multi-robot fleets, and more. Its success derives from its focused design and improved capabilities targeting product-grade and modern robotic systems. Following ROS 2's example, the mobile robotics ecosystem has been fully redesigned based on the transformed needs of modern robots and is experiencing active development not seen since its inception. This paper comes from the desks of the key ROS Navigation maintainers to review and analyze the state of the art of robotics navigation in ROS 2. This includes new systems without parallel in ROS 1 or other similar mobile robotics frameworks. We discuss current research products and historically robust methods that provide differing behaviors and support for most every robot type. This survey consists of overviews, comparisons, and expert insights organized by the fundamental problems in the field. Some of these implementations have yet to be described in literature and many have not been benchmarked relative to others. We end by providing a glimpse into the future of the ROS 2 mobile robotics ecosystem.

AB In millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, beam selection can enhance channel capacity and reduce error rate. However, existing beam selection methods for MIMO systems rely on traditional optimization techniques, which may not be feasible for real-time data transmission. Hence, this paper proposes a novel beam prediction approach via multi-modal fusion and spatio-temporal-enabled features. Specifically, the proposed method can improve MIMO system performance by integrating information from multiple perspectives, such as temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Moreover, the proposed approach is based on a deep learning framework utilizing 3-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3DCNNs) and transformer module to capture spatio-temporal data correlations. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed mechanism outperforms massive benchmarks in terms of beam prediction accuracy from 2.63% to 11%.

ID INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES; ASSOCIATION RULES
AB Bayesian Confirmation Measures (BCMs) are used to assess the degree to which an evidence (or premise) E supports or contradicts an hypothesis (or conclusion) H, making use of prior probability Pr(H), posterior probability Pr(HIE) and of probability of evidence Pr(E). In the literature many BCMs have been defined with the consequent need for their comparison. For this purpose, various criteria have been proposed and some of these refer to symmetry properties. We relate the set of possible symmetries of BCMs, via an isomorphism, to the dihedral group of symmetries of the square. In this way it is possible to identify 10 subsets of symmetries that can coexist, for each subset we suggest a representative BCM, defining at this aim two new BCMs. The structure of the subgroups of the dihedral group allows also to provide an algorithm that simplifies the verification of the symmetry properties. Addressing the debate on which symmetry properties should be considered as desirable and which should not, we define asymmetry measures for BCMs. In fact, different BCMs that do not satisfy a specific symmetry property may exhibit different levels of asymmetry, this way resulting more (less) desirable. The evidence for the practical use of the approach is given through the numerical evaluation of the asymmetry degrees of some BCMs, showing this way how it is possible to discover some of their characteristics, similarities and differences.

DE Dimension reduction; Data visualization; Space-filling curves
AB Dimensionality reduction helps data analysts and machine learning designers to visualize in low dimension structures lying in high dimension. This is a basic but crucial operation, to discover relationship between variables, considering the difficulties to tweek machine learning algorithm. The data have not to be consider as a black-box but can be visualized, leading to better decision making. Inspired from previous works, this article proposes to create a dimensionality reduction method based on space-filling curves (SFCs). Of course, the Hilbert curve was considered (guided by reflected binary gray code pattern) but also alternative high locality SFCs, recently identified. Mapping algorithms working with alternative curves are provided, and illustrated through a numerical example. Mapping a D-dimensional point to a 1D index is usual but developing an algorithm for reverse mapping, i.e. from 1D index to 2D or 3D point is more original and can allow the visualization of data. The work position is specified and justifications are given. A discussion on the choice of parameters (order of curves n and n') is led in order to guide the user to select good parameters (to define a bijection between original data space and projected space). Experiments are conducted to compare our proposition to state of the art approaches (PCA, MDS, t-SNE, UMAP) over seven dataset involving from 3D to 16D and covering diverse topologies. The results show interesting ability on data visualization. Compare to standard techniques, the time computing is low, which is an interesting property in regards to the amount of data today created.

ID INFORMATION
AB Query auto-completion (QAC) aims at suggesting plausible completions for a given query prefix. Traditionally, QAC systems have leveraged tries curated from historical query logs to suggest most popular completions. In this context, there are two specific scenarios that are difficult to handle for any QAC system: short prefixes (which are inherently ambiguous) and unseen prefixes. Recently, personalized Natural Language Generation (NLG) models have been proposed to leverage previous session queries as context for addressing these two challenges. However, such NLG models suffer from two drawbacks: (1) some of the previous session queries could be noisy and irrelevant to the user intent for the current prefix, and (2) NLG models cannot directly incorporate historical query popularity. This motivates us to propose a novel NLG model for QAC, TRiE-NLG, which jointly leverages popularity signals from trie and personalization signals from previous session queries. We train the TRiE-NLG model by augmenting the prefix with rich context comprising of recent session queries and top trie completions. This simple modeling approach overcomes the limitations of trie-based and NLG-based approaches, and leads to state-of-theart performance. We evaluate the TRiE-NLG model using two large QAC datasets. On average, our model achieves huge similar to 57% and similar to 14% boost in MRR over the popular trie-based lookup and the strong BART-based baseline methods, respectively. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/kaushal0494/Trie-NLG.

Its effectiveness was evaluated through user experiments, where participants were asked to rank the weights of three virtual balls and identify the direction of force applied to a virtual ball in separate tests. Additionally, the device's ability to render various shapes was also examined. ResultsThe experiments showed that 73.3% of participants accurately ranked the balls by mass, and an overall correctness rate of 87.3% was achieved for force direction identification. For shape rendering, the device yielded more accurate results for simple objects like spheres, whereas rendering more complex objects such as cups and cones was challenging. DiscussionThe findings indicate that this wearable device has potential applications in haptic feedback and virtual reality contexts. Despite the challenges with complex shape rendering, the device shows promising capability in enhancing the user's immersive experience in virtual environments.

AB The severity of diseases develops gradually, and early screening is critical to apply timely medical inter-ventions. Previous deep learning classification methods for disease grading have ignored the ordinal rela-tionships among stages of disease severity, but this study shows they can be used to boost disease -grading performance. In this paper, we design an ordinal regularized module to represent the orderliness in disease severity, which can be flexibly embedded into general classification networks to grade diseases more accurately. In addition, this ordinal regularized module also predicts the progress of disease devel-opment. The proposed method is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets: the IDRiD challenge dataset, LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) dataset, and Messidor dataset. Experiments show that the proposed method is not only superior to the baselines from common classification models but also outperforms deep learning approaches, especially on the IDRiD challenge dataset, where our method has a joint accuracy of 68.0%. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves excellent performance in both single-disease and joint-disease grading tasks on the aforementioned datasets, and it can be applied to other disease-grading tasks.

AB Renewable resources are a crucial component in power system research within contemporary intelligent power systems. It is imperative that they are given meticulous consideration. Microgrids (MGs) have emerged as a solution to facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources on a large scale. The incorporation of power production innovations that exhibit high levels of unpredictability in their generation would have a notable impact on the management of power resource planning within microgrids. Therefore, it is imperative to implement efficient power management mechanisms in microgrids. This study introduces a scheduling arrangement for a microgrid (MG) that includes a solar power unit (PV), which operates on a day-ahead basis. This paper explores the effects of various weather variables on the power generated by photovoltaic units and the optimum scheduling of microgrids. The present study employs the modified fluid search optimization algorithm to address the challenge of optimum management of energy in a microgrid connected to the grid that is characterized by a high level of unpredictability. The simulation results of the study indicate that the implementation of a photovoltaic model in an actual setting enhances the precision of the system for managing energy and reduces the overall operational costs of the interconnected microgrid. The algorithm under focus has been evaluated on a standard MG. The method under consideration has been executed on the MATLAB/Simulink computational environment and its efficacy has been evaluated.

ID CONSUMPTION
AB Annual increases in global energy consumption are an unavoidable consequence of a growing global economy and population. Among different sectors, the construction industry consumes an average of 20.1% of the world's total energy. Therefore, exploring methods for estimating the amount of energy used is critical. There are several approaches that have been developed to address this issue. The proposed methods are expected to contribute to energy savings as well as reduce the risks of global warming. There are diverse types of computational approaches to predicting energy use. These existing approaches belong to the statistics-based, engineering-based, and machine learning-based categories. Machine learning-based frameworks showed better performance compared to these other approaches. In our study, we proposed using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), a tree-based ensemble learning algorithm, to tackle the issue. We used a dataset containing energy consumption hourly recorded in an office building in Shanghai, China, from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016. The experimental results demonstrated that the XGB model developed using both historical and date features worked better than those developed using only one type of feature. The best-performing model achieved RMSE and MAPE values of 109.00 and 0.24, respectively.

AB The rise of targeted advertising has led to frequent privacy data leaks, as advertisers are reluctant to share information to safeguard their interests. This has resulted in isolated data islands and model heterogeneity challenges. To address these issues, we have proposed a C-means clustering algorithm based on maximum average difference to improve the evaluation of the difference in distribution between local and global parameters. Additionally, we have introduced an innovative dynamic selection algorithm that leverages knowledge distillation and weight correction to reduce the impact of model heterogeneity. Our framework was tested on various datasets and its performance was evaluated using accuracy, loss, and AUC (area under the ROC curve) metrics. Results showed that the framework outperformed other models in terms of higher accuracy, lower loss, and better AUC while requiring the same computation time. Our research aims to provide a more reliable, controllable, and secure data sharing framework to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of targeted advertising.

AB Traditional rolling bearing fault diagnosis approaches require a large amount of fault data in advance, while some specific fault data is difficult to obtain in engineering scenarios. This imbalanced fault data problem seriously affects the accuracy of fault diagnosis. To improve the accuracy under imbalanced data conditions, we propose a novel data augmentation method of Enhanced Generative Adversarial Networks with Data Selection Module (EGAN-DSM). Firstly, a network enhancement module is designed, which quantifies antagonism between the generator and discriminator through loss value. And the module determines whether to iteratively enhance the networks with weak adversarial ability. Secondly, a Data Selected Module (DSM) is constructed using Hilbert space distance for screening generated data, and the screened data is mixed with original imbalanced data to reconstruct balanced data sets. Then, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks withWide First-layer Kernels (WDCNN) is used for fault diagnosis. Finally, the method is verified by data measured on a rotating machine experimental platform. The results show that our method has high fault diagnosis accuracy under the condition of imbalanced data.

TI Ternary symmetric fusion network for camouflaged object detection

DT Article
DE Camouflaged object detection; Deep learning; Receptive field; Context

AB Camouflage object detection (COD) is designed to locate objects that are "seamlessly" embedded in the surrounding environment. Camouflaged object detection is a challenging task due to the high intrinsic similarities between objects and their backgrounds, as well as the low boundary contrast between them. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new ternary symmetric fusion network (TSFNet), which can detect camouflaged objects by fully fusing features of different levels and scales. Specifically, the network proposed in this paper mainly contains two key modules: the location-attention search (LAS) module and the ternary symmetric interaction fusion (TSIF) module. The location-attention search module makes full use of contextual information to position potential target objects from a global perspective while enhancing feature representation and guiding feature fusion. The ternary symmetric interaction fusion module consists of three branches: bilateral branches gather rich contextual information of multi-level features, and a middle branch provides fusion attention coefficients for the other two branches. The strategy can effectively achieve information fusion between low- and high-level features, and then achieve the refinement of edge details. Experimental results show that the method is an effective COD model and outperforms existing models. Compared with the existing model SINetV2, TSFNet significantly improves the performance by 3.5% weighted F-measure and 8.1% MAE on the COD10K.

ID GENERALIZED DIRICHLET; INFORMATION; FRAMEWORK
AB The Dirichlet distribution is widely used in the context of mixture models. Despite its flexibility, it still suffers from some limitations, such as its restrictive covariance matrix and its direct proportionality between its mean and variance. In this work, a generalization over the Dirichlet distribution, namely the Nested Dirichlet distribution, is introduced in the context of finite mixture model providing more flexibility and overcoming the mentioned drawbacks, thanks to its hierarchical structure. The model learning is based on the generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, where parameters are initialized with the method of moments and estimated through the iterative Newton-Raphson method. Moreover, the minimum message length criterion is proposed to determine the best number of components that describe the data clusters by the finite mixture model. The Nested Dirichlet distribution is proven to be part of the exponential family, which offers several advantages, such as the calculation of several probabilistic distances in closed forms. The performance of the Nested Dirichlet mixture model is compared to the Dirichlet mixture model, the generalized Dirichlet mixture model, and the Convolutional Neural Network as a deep learning network. The excellence of the powerful proposed framework is validated through this comparison via challenging datasets. The hierarchical feature of the model is applied to real-world challenging tasks such as hierarchical cluster analysis and hierarchical feature learning, showing a significant improvement in terms of accuracy.

TI A two-stage progressive shadow removal network
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Image restoration; Shadow removal; Image-to-image; Coarse-to-fine
AB Removing image shadows has been a challenging task in computer vision due to its diversity and complexity. Shadow removal techniques have been greatly enhanced by deep learning and shadow image datasets, but state-of-the-art methods generally consider the information of the shadow and its neighborhood, ignoring the correlation of the features between the shadow and non-shadow regions. It leads to the resulting image presenting poor overall consistency and unnatural boundary between the original shadow and non-shadow areas. To obtain a consistent and natural shadow removal result, a two-stage progressive shadow removal network is proposed. The first stage performs a multi-exposure fusion network (MEFN) to roughly recover the shadow region features, while in the second stage, a fine-recovery network (FRN) is performed to extract the correlation among the global image contexts, accompanied by a detail feature fusion step. This coarse-to-fine process improves the overall effect of shadow removal, in terms of image quality and boundary consistency. Extensive experiments on the widely used ISTD, ISTD+ and SRD datasets show that the proposed shadow removal network outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods.

AB In order to obtain the state of students' listening in class objectively and accurately, we can obtain students' emotions through their expressions in class and cognitive feedback through their behaviors in class, and then integrate the two to obtain a comprehensive assessment results of classroom status. However, when obtaining students' classroom expressions, the major problem is how to accurately and efficiently extract the expression features from the time dimension and space dimension of the class videos. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a class expression recognition model based on spatio-temporal residual attention network (STRAN), which could extract facial expression features through convolution operation in both time and space dimensions on the basis of limited resources, shortest time consumption and optimal performance. Specifically, STRAN firstly uses the residual network with the three-dimensional convolution to solve the problem of network degradation when the depth of the convolutional neural network increases, and the convergence speed of the whole network is accelerated at the same number of layers. Secondly, the spatio-temporal attention mechanism is introduced so that the network can effectively focus on the important video frames and the key areas within the frames. In order to enhance the comprehensiveness and correctness of the final classroom evaluation results, we use deep convolutional neural network to capture students' behaviors while obtaining their classroom expressions. Then, an intelligent classroom state assessment method(Weight_classAssess) combining students' expressions and behaviors is proposed to evaluate the classroom state. Finally, on the basis of the public datasets CK+ and FER2013, we construct two more comprehensive synthetic datasets CK+_Class and FER2013_Class, which are more suitable for the scene of classroom teaching, by adding some collected video sequences of students in class and images of students' expressions in class. The proposed method is compared with the existing methods, and the results show that STRAN can achieve 93.84% and 80.45% facial expression recognition rates on CK+ and CK+_Class datasets, respectively. The accuracy rate of classroom intelligence assessment of students based on Weight_classAssess also reaches 78.19%, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Recent increase in wildfires worldwide has led to the need for real-time fire nowcasting. Physics-driven models, such as cellular automata and computational fluid dynamics can provide high-fidelity fire spread simulations but they are computationally expensive and time-consuming. Much effort has been put into developing machine learning models for fire prediction. However, these models are often region-specific and require a substantial quantity of simulation data for training purpose. This results in a significant amount of computational effort for different ecoregions. In this work, a generative model is proposed using a three-dimensional Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders to generate spatial-temporal sequences of unseen wildfire burned areas in a given ecoregion. The model is tested in the ecoregion of a recent massive wildfire event in California, known as the Chimney fire. Numerical results show that the model succeed in generating coherent and structured fire scenarios, taking into account the impact from geophysical variables, such as vegetation and slope. Generated data are also used to train a surrogate model for predicting wildfire dissemination, which has been tested on both simulation data and the real Chimney fire event.

AB Decentralized algorithms to solve the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in smart grids have been a significant focus within engineering research due to their advantages in scalability, robustness, and flexibility. Its purpose is to optimize the generation power of each generator to jointly achieve the minimal total generation cost on the premise of satisfying the total demand and generation capacity. Recently, the emergence of data security and the requirement for complex computing have led to a resurgence of activity in this area. To address EDP while considering the issues of private security and computation efficiency, we propose a novel privacy-protected decentralized random sleep algorithm over an unbalanced directed network. On the one hand, the proposed algorithm can effectively protect sensitive information by adding conditional noises in the state exchange. On the other hand, it can also promote computation efficiency over an unbalanced directed network by incorporating the random sleep strategy into the decentralized inexact gradient method with the gradient rescaling technique. It is proved that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve the optimal solution of the EDP. Furthermore, we also provide theoretical proof to guarantee the convergence and privacy properties of the proposed algorithm. Finally, two simulation examples of EDP in smart grids are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB Recently, rating prediction based on deep models has been a promising way to the personalized recommendation for the problem of information overloaded, which is a crucial problem to evaluate users' preferences for different items. In reality, the rating distribution in training data being mostly imbalanced in that the number of low ratings is often much less than that of high ratings, which is the biased prediction or imbalanced dataset problem in the recommendation. However, due to the degree of imbalance always varying greatly in different scenarios, most of the existing imbalanced recommendation methods fix the model parameters and cannot adapt to the change of the ratio between frequent and rare ratings in different datasets. In this article, we propose a novel Self-adaptive Deep Asymmetric Network (SDAN) to address the problem of imbalanced recommendation, which can automatically adjust the model based on the degree of imbalance in the recommendation dataset and accurately predict users' frequent and rare ratings of items. Specifically, two different autoencoders are first introduced to learn the user-based and item-based feature representations. Then the self-adaptive deep network is designed to automatically emphasize more on rare ratings and compensate for the bias prediction problem. Finally, the reconstructed approximated matrix with the features of users and items is utilized for predicting the ratings of user-item pairs. Through comprehensive experiments on several public recommendation datasets with varying imbalanced degrees, our SDAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB As an important component of the rotating machinery, rolling bearings usually work under the condition of variable speed and load, and vibration signals in the same health state are significantly different due to the change in operating conditions. To address the problem that the existing deep learning (DL) methods have fixed nonlinear transformations for all input signals in cross-domain fault diagnosis, we propose a new activation function, i.e., parameter-free adaptively rectified linear units (PfAReLU). The proposed activation function performs adaptive nonlinear transformations according to the input data and can better capture the fault features of vibration signals in the same fault state under different operating conditions. Furthermore, the number of PfAReLU parameters is zero, so that the risk of network overfitting is reduced. At the same time, deep parameter-free reconstruction-classification networks with PfAReLU (DPRCN-PfAReLU) are also constructed for cross-domain fault diagnosis. Specifically, DPRCN-PfAReLU consists of a shared encoder, a target domain decoder, and a source domain classifier. The shared encoder adds a parameter-free attention module at the output to enhance the weight of domain-invariant features without increasing network parameters. The shared encoded representation of source domain and target domain is learned by target domain decoder and source domain classifier. Compared with other methods under nine different operating conditions via real experiment studies, the proposed method shows superiority for cross-domain fault diagnosis.

AB Plants are a major source of food all around the world, and they are mainly affected by diseases caused by pathogens, insects, and parasitic plants. If the diseases are identified in the earlier stage, then it will be easy to apply pesticides and prevent the disease from further propagation. To recognise these diseases at earlier stages automatically, different researchers have established artificial intelligence-based approaches using machine learning and deep learning approaches which can identify the diseased lesions with high accuracy. In this paper, a novel Hybrid Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm-butterfly optimisation algorithm (HMFO-BOA) based optimal ensemble deep transfer network (OEDTN) classifier for banana leaf disease identification is developed. The OEDTN architecture offers increased predictability for banana leaf disease using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), ensemble learning, domain adaptation, and parameter transfer learning. The feature extraction is done by constructing different Deep Transfer Networks (DTN) via diverse kernel MMD. Finally, the DTNs are integrated via ensemble learning to obtain the final classification outcomes. The MFOBOA algorithm assigns optimal voting weights for each DTN to dynamically construct the OEDTN architecture. In the consequent testing process, the input banana leaf disease images are categorised into diverse classes such as BBW (Banana Bacterial Wilt Disease), BBS (Banana Black Sigatoka Disease), Cordana, pestalotiopsis, Sigatoka, and healthy. The experiments conducted on the Banana Leaf and BBW-BBS datasets prove that the proposed model offers improved performance than the state-of-art techniques.

AB Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental tool for data visualization, denoising, and dimensionality reduction. It is widely popular in statistics, machine learning, computer vision, and related fields. However, PCA is well-known to fall prey to outliers and often fails to detect the true underlying low-dimensional structure within the dataset. Following the Median of Means (MoM) philosophy, recent supervised learning methods have shown great success in dealing with outlying observations without much compromise to their large sample theoretical properties. This article proposes a PCA procedure based on the MoM principle. Called the MoMPCA, the proposed method is not only computationally appealing but also achieves optimal convergence rates under minimal assumptions. In particular, we explore the nonasymptotic error bounds of the obtained solution via the aid of the Rademacher complexities while granting absolutely no assumption on the outlying observations. The derived concentration results are not dependent on the dimension because the analysis is conducted in a separable Hilbert space, and the results only depend on the fourth moment of the underlying distribution in the corresponding norm. The proposal's efficacy is also thoroughly showcased through simulations and real data applications.

AB Users an organizations are generating ever-increasing amounts of private data from a wide range of sources. Incorporating private context is important to personalize open-domain tasks such as question-answering, fact-checking, and personal assistants. State-of-the-art systems for these tasks explicitly retrieve information that is relevant to an input question from a background corpus before producing an answer. While today's retrieval systems assume relevant corpora are fully (e.g., publicly) accessible, users are often unable or unwilling to expose their private data to entities hosting public data. We define the Split Iterative Retrieval (SPIRAL) problem involving iterative retrieval over multiple privacy scopes. We introduce a foundational benchmark with which to study SPIRAL, as no existing benchmark includes data from a private distribution. Our dataset, ConcurrentQA, includes data from distinct public and private distributions and is the first textual QA benchmark requiring concurrent retrieval over multiple distributions. Finally, we show that existing retrieval approaches face significant performance degradations when applied to our proposed retrieval setting and investigate approaches with which these tradeoffs can be mitigated. We release the new benchmark and code to reproduce the results.(1)

TI Multilingual Coreference Resolution in Multiparty Dialogue
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Existing multiparty dialogue datasets for entity coreference resolution are nascent, and many challenges are still unaddressed. We create a large-scale dataset, Multilingual Multiparty Coref (MMC), for this task based on TV transcripts. Due to the availability of gold-quality subtitles in multiple languages, we propose reusing the annotations to create silver coreference resolution data in other languages (Chinese and Farsi) via annotation projection. On the gold (English) data, off-the-shelf models perform relatively poorly on MMC, suggesting that MMC has broader coverage of multiparty coreference than prior datasets. On the silver data, we find success both using it for data augmentation and training from scratch, which effectively simulates the zero-shot cross-lingual setting.

TI Directed Acyclic Transformer Pre-training for High-quality
   Non-autoregressive Text Generation
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Non-AutoRegressive (NAR) text generation models have drawn much attention because of their significantly faster decoding speed and good generation quality in machine translation. However, in a wider range of text generation tasks, existing NAR models lack proper pre-training, making them still far behind the pre-trained autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose Pre-trained Directed Acyclic Transformer (PreDAT) and a novel pre-training task to promote prediction consistency in NAR generation. Experiments on five text generation tasks show that our PreDAT remarkably outperforms existing pre-trained NAR models (+4.2 score on average) and even achieves better results than pre-trained autoregressive baselines in n-gram-based metrics, along with 17 times speedup in throughput. Further analysis shows that PreDAT benefits from the unbiased prediction order that alleviates the error accumulation problem in autoregressive generation, which provides new insights into the advantages of NAR generation.(1)

AB Motivated by the fact that there exists the operation of conjugation in quantum systems, the concept of bicon-numbers is proposed in this article. The bicon-numbers are defined by introducing two symbolic parameters into the set of complex numbers. The basic functions of these two symbolic parameters are specified by an axiom which abstracts the operation of complex conjugation. Basic properties are developed for the operations of addition and multiplication in the bicon-number set. In addition, several different forms are given for bicon-numbers, and the corresponding operation rules are established. By exploring the relations of the vensors in the bicon-number set, the structure of the bicon-number set is depicted, and real matrix representations of bicon-numbers are also presented. Besides, bicomplex matrix representations for bicon-numbers are also investigated in view that the operation of multiplication for bicomplex numbers possesses commutativity property. In addition, the matrices with bicon-numbers as entries are investigated, and state responses of some quantum systems are given within the framework of bicon-numbers.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article
DE Hand pose estimation; Efficient annotation; Learning with limited labels
ID TRACKING
AB In this survey, we present a systematic review of 3D hand pose estimation from the perspective of efficient annotation and learning. 3D hand pose estimation has been an important research area owing to its potential to enable various applications, such as video understanding, AR/VR, and robotics. However, the performance of models is tied to the quality and quantity of annotated 3D hand poses. Under the status quo, acquiring such annotated 3D hand poses is challenging, e.g., due to the difficulty of 3D annotation and the presence of occlusion. To reveal this problem, we review the pros and cons of existing annotation methods classified as manual, synthetic-model-based, hand-sensor-based, and computational approaches. Additionally, we examine methods for learning 3D hand poses when annotated data are scarce, including self-supervised pretraining, semi-supervised learning, and domain adaptation. Based on the study of efficient annotation and learning, we further discuss limitations and possible future directions in this field.

ID FACE ALIGNMENT; REGRESSION; ENSEMBLE
AB Head pose estimation (HPE) is a challenging and critical research subject with a wide range of applications in areas such as driver monitoring, attention recognition, and human-computer interaction. However, there are two challenging problems in HPE, the first one is that in real application scenarios, occlusion is very common, which affects the accuracy of HPE to a great extent. The second is that most research works use Euler angles to represent the head pose, which may lead to problems in neural network optimization. To solve these problems, an adaptive occlusion hybrid second-order attention network model was proposed. First, facial landmarks were detected by the occlusion-aware module to generate heat maps reflecting the presence or absence of occlusion in the specific facial parts, thereby enhancing features in the non-occluded parts of the face and suppressing features in the occluded regions. Meanwhile, we designed a novel second-order information attention module to interact with spatial and channel information using second-order statistical information, such that the model learns the feature correlations of different facial parts while paying more attention to important channels and suppressing redundant ones to further reduce the effect of occlusion and excavate more powerful features. Furthermore, to avoid ambiguity in common head pose representation, we introduced an exponential map to represent the head pose and designed a prediction framework capable of capturing the geometry of the pose space. The results of the experiments showed that the proposed model was competitive with methods using depth information from the BIWI dataset and achieved obvious advantages on the challenging AFLW2000 dataset, with more robust performance under large poses and occlusion interference, and stronger robustness compared with other models.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Continual learning; Catastrophic forgetting; Data-free Knowledge
   distillation; Contrastive learning
AB While continual learning has shown its impressive performance in addressing catastrophic forgetting of traditional neural networks and enabling them to learn multiple tasks continuously, it still requires a large amount of input data to train neural networks with satisfactory classification performance. Since collecting a large amount of training data is a time-consuming and expensive procedure, this study attempts to propose a novel data-free contrastive reversion method for continual learning (DFCRCL) to significantly reduce the number of training data for continual learning, while maintaining or even improving the classification performance of continual learning. In order to achieve such a goal, DFCRCL uses contrastive reversion to generate high-semantic pseudo samples from the previous task to guide the training of the current task. DFCRCL has three merits: (1) knowledge distillation from the previous task model to the current task model guarantees both the reduction of training data and the avoidance of catastrophic forgetting, and thus DFCRCL can effectively learn a sequence of tasks continuously (2) contrastive reversion enhances the semantic diversity of pseudo samples by learning the distinguishability between distinct pseudo samples in the feature space (3) contrastive reversion improves the performance of knowledge distillation in DFCRCL by enhancing the semantic diversity of the pseudo samples generated from the previous task model. Compared to six mainstream continual learning methods, the proposed DFCRCL achieves at least comparable or even better classification performance and stability in four benchmarking continual learning scenarios. In addition, the effectiveness of DFCRCL is demonstrated by ablation experiments.

AB In this paper, we propose a deep feature network with multi-scale fusion (DFNet) for addressing the problem of crowd counting in highly congested noisy scenes. DFNet contains three modules: feature encoder, feature decoder and feature fusion. The feature encoder uses a VGG-16-based convolutional neural network (CNN) that encodes features from images and forms a kind of low-level spatial information. The feature decoder is a multi-column dilated convolutional neural network (McDCNN) with different dilation rates that can capture a multi-scale contextual information, decode the low-level spatial information and generate a kind of high-level semantic information. Furthermore, the multi-column architecture in McDCNN can effectively relieve the "gridding" issue presented in the dilated convolution framework. The feature fusion block uses a simple and effective network architecture to sufficiently incorporate the low-level spatial and the high-level semantic information for facilitating high-quality density map estimation and performing accurate crowd counting. Extensive experiments on several highly challenging crowd counting datasets are conducted. Experimental results show that DFNet is comparable with recent state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Annotation has demonstrated its importance in several areas, notably in the modeling of annotation activity in the automation and adaptation phase. However, the context sensor is commonly manual or semi-automatic. The use of the Internet of Things with annotation gives a qualitative leap in the field of higher education and universities. In this field, teachers, during their pedagogical activities, require more information found in different textual documents, tools, and databases. In addition, they organized several meetings and took considerable time to make appropriate and right decisions during the deliberation process. In this paper, we propose an adaptive annotation tool based on the Internet of Things addressed for teachers during their educational tasks. The presented tool automatically adapts according to the context of the teacher's tasks and it enables the annotation of all documents written in different languages. To consider all the parameters of the teaching activities when interfacing with the annotation and to give the useful information for teachers during decision-making, we have adopted an architecture based on the ontology of context and the multilingual ontology of deliberation and redemption. To implement this tool, we used Semantic Web and Internet of Things technology to achieve the desired architecture. Likewise, the usability of the proposed annotation tool has been tested with a real case in coordination with teachers and administrators during the deliberation operation to decide to rescue and redeem students at the university.

TI Python API Misuse Mining and Classification Based on Hybrid Analysis and
   Attention Mechanism

DT Article
DE API misuse; Python; program analysis; mining; deep learning
AB APIs play a crucial role in contemporary software development, streamlining implementation and maintenance processes. However, improper API usage can result in significant issues such as unexpected outcomes, security vulnerabilities and system crashes. To detect API misuses, current methods primarily rely on comparing established API usage patterns with target points for automated detection, mainly based on pre-validated datasets. Nonetheless, there is a scarcity of publicly available datasets on API misuses and their corresponding fixes, which hinders data-driven research. Moreover, most existing techniques concentrate on statically typed languages, such as Java and C, with only a few addressing dynamic languages like Python effectively, due to difficulties in handling dynamic features. Therefore, it is essential to identify Python API misuses and their fixes automatically and promptly. In this paper, we introduce HatPAM, a Hybrid Analysis and Attention-based Python API-Misuse Miner, which (a) provides a method for automatically mining true-positive commits related to Python API-misuse fixes from GitHub and (b) presents the subsequent processing for classifying Python API misuses in true-positive cases. Particularly, HatPAM applies hybrid static analysis and introduces a structure-based attention mechanism to examine syntax, semantics and structural features in Python code context, and considers the consistency between code and developers' natural intent to significantly reduce false-positive cases. Evaluation on six popular Python projects reveals that HatPAM outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 92.2% Precision, 86.7% Recall and 89.3% F1-score, indicating its capability to identify and classify Python API-misuse commits.

TI Learning logic programs by explaining their failures
SO MACHINE LEARNING

DT Article
DE Relational learning; Inductive logic programming; Failure explanation
AB Scientists form hypotheses and experimentally test them. If a hypothesis fails (is refuted), scientists try to explain the failure to eliminate other hypotheses. The more precise the failure analysis the more hypotheses can be eliminated. Thus inspired, we introduce failure explanation techniques for inductive logic programming. Given a hypothesis represented as a logic program, we test it on examples. If a hypothesis fails, we explain the failure in terms of failing sub-programs. In case a positive example fails, we identify failing sub-programs at the granularity of literals. We introduce a failure explanation algorithm based on analysing branches of SLD-trees. We integrate a meta-interpreter based implementation of this algorithm with the test-stage of the Popper ILP system. We show that fine-grained failure analysis allows for learning fine-grained constraints on the hypothesis space. Our experimental results show that explaining failures can drastically reduce hypothesis space exploration and learning times.

AB We develop a new model for tensor completion which incorporates noisy side information available on the rows and columns of a 3-dimensional tensor. This method learns a low rank representation of the data along with regression coefficients for the observed noisy features. Given this model, we propose an efficient alternating minimization algorithm to find high-quality solutions that scales to large data sets. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that this method leads to significant gains in out-of-sample accuracy filling in missing values in both simulated and real-world data. We consider the problem of imputing drug response in three large-scale anti-cancer drug screening data sets: the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and the Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (GCSI). On imputation tasks with 20% to 80% missing data, we show that the proposed method TensorGenomic matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods including the original tensor model and a multilevel mixed effects model. With 80% missing data, TensorGenomic improves the R2 from 0.404 to 0.552 in the GDSC data set, 0.407 to 0.524 in the CCLE data set, and 0.331 to 0.453 in the GCSI data set compared to the tensor model which does not take into account genomic side information.

ID PREDICTION; CARE
AB For many machine learning models, a choice of hyperparameters is a crucial step towards achieving high performance. Prevalent meta-learning approaches focus on obtaining good hyperparameter configurations with a limited computational budget for a completely new task based on the results obtained from the prior tasks. This paper proposes a new formulation of the tuning problem, called consolidated learning, more suited to practical challenges faced by model developers, in which a large number of predictive models are created on similar datasets. In such settings, we are interested in the total optimization time rather than tuning for a single task. We show that a carefully selected static portfolio of hyperparameter configurations yields good results for anytime optimization, while maintaining the ease of use and implementation. Moreover, we point out how to construct such a portfolio for specific domains. The improvement in the optimization is possible due to the more efficient transfer of hyperparameter configurations between similar tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through an empirical study for the XGBoost algorithm and the newly created metaMIMIC benchmarks of predictive tasks extracted from the MIMIC-IV medical database. In the paper, we show that the potential of consolidated learning is considerably greater due to its compatibility with many machine learning application scenarios.

TI Mean-Field Approximations With Adaptive Coupling for Networks With

DT Article
ID SYNAPTIC MODIFICATION; COORDINATED RESET; MODEL
AB Understanding the effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is key to elucidating how neural networks change over long timescales and to design interventions aimed at modulating such networks in neurological disorders. However, progress is restricted by the significant computational cost associated with simulating neural network models with STDP and by the lack of low-dimensional description that could provide analytical insights. Phase-difference-dependent plasticity (PDDP) rules approximate STDP in phase oscillator networks, which prescribe synaptic changes based on phase differences of neuron pairs rather than differences in spike timing. Here we construct mean-field approximations for phase oscillator networks with STDP to describe part of the phase space for this very high-dimensional system. We first show that single-harmonic PDDP rules can approximate a simple form of symmetric STDP, while multiharmonic rules are required to accurately approximate causal STDP. We then derive exact expressions for the evolution of the average PDDP coupling weight in terms of network synchrony. For adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators that form clusters, we formulate a family of low-dimensional descriptions based on the mean-field dynamics of each cluster and average coupling weights between and within clusters. Finally, we show that such a two-cluster mean-field model can be fitted to synthetic data to provide a low-dimensional approximation of a full adaptive network with symmetric STDP. Our framework represents a step toward a low-dimensional description of adaptive networks with STDP, and could for example inform the development of new therapies aimed at maximizing the long-lasting effects of brain stimulation.

AB Mirror descent is an elegant optimization technique that leverages a dual space of parametric models to perform gradient descent. While originally developed for convex optimization, it has increasingly been applied in the field of machine learning. In this study, we propose a novel approach for using mirror descent to initialize the parameters of neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that by using the Hopfield model as a prototype for neural networks, mirror descent can effectively train the model with significantly improved performance compared to traditional gradient descent methods that rely on random parameter initialization. Our findings highlight the potential of mirror descent as a promising initialization technique for enhancing the optimization of machine learning models.

AB In this letter, we use composite optimization algorithms to solve sigmoid networks. We equivalently transfer the sigmoid networks to a convex composite optimization and propose the composite optimization algorithms based on the linearized proximal algorithms and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Under the assumptions of the weak sharp minima and the regularity condition, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a globally optimal solution of the objective function even in the case of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems. Furthermore, the convergence results can be directly related to the amount of training data and provide a general guide for setting the size of sigmoid networks. Numerical experiments on Franke's function fitting and handwritten digit recognition show that the proposed algorithms perform satisfactorily and robustly.

TI A Noise-Based Novel Strategy for Faster SNN Training
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID VISUAL FEATURES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SPIKING
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are receiving increasing attention due to their low power consumption and strong bioplausibility. Optimization of SNNs is a challenging task. Two main methods, artificial neural network (ANN)-to-SNN conversion and spike-based backpropagation (BP), both have advantages and limitations. ANN-to-SNN conversion requires a long inference time to approximate the accuracy of ANN, thus diminishing the benefits of SNN. With spike-based BP, training high-precision SNNs typically consumes dozens of times more computational resources and time than their ANN counterparts. In this letter, we propose a novel SNN training approach that combines the benefits of the two methods. We first train a single-step SNN(T = 1) by approximating the neural potential distribution with random noise, then convert the single-step SNN(T = 1) to a multistep SNN(T = N) losslessly. The introduction of gaussian distributed noise leads to a significant gain in accuracy after conversion. The results show that our method considerably reduces the training and inference times of SNNs while maintaining their high accuracy. Compared to the previous two methods, ours can reduce training time by 65% to 75% and achieves more than 100 times faster inference speed. We also argue that the neuron model augmented with noise makes it more bioplausible.

AB Emotional controllers have been successfully pursued toward various control objectives in the past two decades, but there remain considerable challenges in exploiting their theoretical and cognitive aspects. This paper addresses these two challenges by proposing a modified thalamic connection based on an averaging operator using a radial basis emotional network (RBEN-ATC). From a theoretical perspective, we prove that the resulting RBEN-ATC mapping has the universal function approximation property. It also becomes continuous and differentiable with respect to the network weights. We then incorporate this structure to approximate the unknown dynamics of a nonlinear affine system with nonsymmetric input saturation and develop a stable adaptive radial basis emotional controller (ARBEC). From a cognitive perspective, we stay committed to the fundamental laws of the emotional brain. While this standpoint considerably complicates the design process, the resulting control system becomes interpretable from a biological perspective. For these purposes, a two-prong approach is employed here. Firstly, we incorporate a first-order compensator that handles the errors due to the nonsymmetric actuator saturation with unknown bounds. Secondly, we use a robust adaptive compensator that lessens the effect of uncertainties. Lyapunov stability analysis shows the overall ARBEC closed-loop stability of the nonlinear system. Furthermore, comparisons with other competing neuro- and fuzzy approaches show that ARBEC has better noise rejection and steady-state tracking while having comparable control energy consumption.

TI NFSDense201: microstructure image classification based on non-fixed size
   patch division with pre-trained DenseNet201 layers
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Non-fixed size patch division; Deep feature engineering; SEM image
   classification; DenseNet201
AB In the field of nanoscience, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is widely employed to visualize the surface topography and composition of materials. In this study, we present a novel SEM image classification model called NFSDense201, which incorporates several key components. Firstly, we propose a unique nested patch division approach that divides each input image into four patches of varying dimensions. Secondly, we utilize DenseNet201, a deep neural network pretrained on ImageNet1k, to extract 2920 deep features from the last fully connected and global average pooling layers. Thirdly, we introduce an iterative neighborhood component analysis function to select the most discriminative features from the merged feature vector, which is formed by concatenating the four feature vectors extracted per input image. This process results in a final feature vector of optimal length 698. Lastly, we employ a standard shallow support vector machine classifier to perform the actual classification. To evaluate the performance of NFSDense201, we conducted experiments using a large public SEM image dataset. The dataset consists of 972, 162, 326, 4590, 3820, 3925, 4755, 181, 917, and 1624.jpeg images belonging to the following microstructural categories: "biological," "fibers," "film-coated surfaces," "MEMS devices and electrodes," "nanowires," "particles," "pattern surfaces," "porous sponge," "powder," and "tips," respectively. For both four-class and ten-class classification tasks, we evaluated NFSDense201 using subsets of the dataset containing 5080 and 21,272 images, respectively. The results demonstrate the superior performance of NFSDense201, achieving a four-class classification accuracy rate of 99.53% and a ten-class classification accuracy rate of 97.09%. These accuracy rates compare favorably against previously published SEM image classification models. Additionally, we report the performance of NFSDense201 for each class in the dataset.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB The research on video isolated sign language recognition (SLR) algorithms has made leaping progress, but there are problems that need to be solved urgently in the field of SLR. On the one hand, traditional sign language acquisition equipment has the disadvantages of being expensive and not easy to carry. Sign language collected based on Kinect contains rich information, but it is complicated to use. The data acquired by RGB cameras are beneficial to practical applications, but the existing sign language datasets collected by RGB cameras have disadvantages such as few demonstrators and small vocabulary. On the other hand, most of the existing SLR methods use complex network structures to achieve high accuracy, but complex networks mean longer inference time, which cannot meet practical application scenarios at all. In this paper, we propose a Chinese large-scale isolated sign language dataset named CSLD, which is collected using RGB camera, and each vocabulary is illustrated 10 times by 30 demonstrators, including 400 words. In addition, we proposed a lightweight TIM-SLR network. In order to verify lightweight and validity of the network, we not only conducted experiments on sign language datasets CSLD and LSA64, and obtained 91.6% and 99.8% accuracy, respectively, but also performed experiments on action recognition datasets Sth-Sth (V1 and V2) and both achieve state-of-the-art performance. Not only can it obtain higher accuracy, but also inference speed and parameter of the network can meet practical application scenarios, because TIM-SLR network is only composed of 2D convolution and temporal interaction module (TIM).

DE Smart shop floor; Self-adaptive scheduling; Double deep Q-network;
   Dynamic reward function
AB In the field of smart manufacturing, the data-driven scheduling approach has become an effective way to solve the smart shop floor scheduling problem with high complexity and dynamics. However, most existing approaches rely too heavily on manual supervision in implementation, resulting in poor adaptability and effectiveness in dynamic production environments. Therefore, this paper proposes a self-adaptive scheduling approach based on double deep Q-network (DDQN), which can reduce manual supervision and realize the autonomy of the whole scheduling process. In the presented approach, first, a self-adaptive scheduling framework, which forms a closed-loop optimization structure for scheduling model evaluation, generation/updating, and application, is designed. Second, the interactive learning mechanism of reinforcement learning is introduced, and the scheduling model is generated through the DDQN algorithm without manual supervision. In addition, dynamic reward function based on simulation is proposed to promote the rationality and accuracy of the reward in reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on a semiconductor production shop floor, and the experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of self-adaptive scheduling and significantly reduce the time and labour costs in the dynamic production environments.

TI Optimal neighborhood kernel clustering with adaptive local kernels and
   block diagonal property
SO NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Multiple kernel clustering; Neighborhood kernel; Local base kernels;
   Block diagonal representation
ID SUBSPACE SEGMENTATION
AB The purpose of multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is usually to generate an optimal kernel by fusing the information of multiple base kernels. Among the methods of generating the optimal kernel, a neighborhood kernel is usually used to enlarge the search range of the optimal kernel, or local base kernels are selected to avoid the redundancy of base kernels. However, few studies combine both methods simultaneously; then, the quality of the optimal kernel cannot be improved very well. Furthermore, most MKC methods require two-step strategy to cluster, that is, first generate clustering indicator matrix, and then execute clustering. This does not guarantee that the final clustering results are optimal. In order to overcome the above drawbacks, an optimal neighborhood kernel clustering with adaptive local kernel and block diagonal property (ONKC-ALK-BD) is proposed in this paper. In our proposed method, a simple weight strategy of selecting local base kernels is used to produce a consensus kernel, a neighborhood kernel of which is chosen as the optimal kernel. And a block diagonal (BD) regularizer imposed on the clustering indicator matrix encourages the matrix to be BD. On one hand, our proposed method avoids the redundancy of base kernels and ensures the diversity of selected base kernels. On the other hand, it expands the search range of the optimal kernel and improves its representation ability. Thus, the quality of the optimal kernel is enhanced. In addition, the BD property of the indicator matrix is helpful to obtain explicit clustering indicators and achieve one-step clustering, which ensures that the final results of our method are optimal for the original problem. Finally, extensive experiments on twelve data sets and comparisons with seven clustering methods show that ONKC-ALK-BD is effective.

TI On safe and usable chatbots for promoting voter participation
SO AI MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Chatbots, or bots for short, are multimodal collaborative assistants that can help people complete useful tasks. Usually, when chatbots are referenced in connection with elections, they often draw negative reactions due to the fear of mis-information and hacking. Instead, in this work, we explore how chatbots may be used to promote voter participation in vulnerable segments of society like senior citizens and first-time voters. In particular, we have built a system that amplifies official information while personalizing it to users' unique needs transparently (e.g., language, cognitive abilities, linguistic abilities). The uniqueness of this work are (a) a safe design where only responses that are grounded and traceable to an allowed source (e.g., official question/answer) will be answered via system's self-awareness (metacognition), (b) a do-not-respond strategy that can handle customizable responses/deflection, and (c) a low-programming design-pattern based on the open-source Rasa platform to generate chatbots quickly for any region. Our current prototypes use frequently asked questions (FAQ) election information for two US states that are low on an ease-of-voting scale, and have performed initial evaluations using focus groups with senior citizens. Our approach can be a win-win for voters, election agencies trying to fulfill their mandate and democracy at large.

DT Article
AB Our paper aims to analyze political polarization in US political system using language models, and thereby help candidates make an informed decision. The availability of this information will help voters understand their candidates' views on the economy, healthcare, education, and other social issues. Our main contributions are a dataset extracted from Wikipedia that spans the past 120 years and a language model-based method that helps analyze how polarized a candidate is. Our data are divided into two parts, background information and political information about a candidate, since our hypothesis is that the political views of a candidate should be based on reason and be independent of factors such as birthplace, alma mater, and so forth. We further split this data into four phases chronologically, to help understand if and how the polarization amongst candidates changes. This data has been cleaned to remove biases. To understand the polarization, we begin by showing results from some classical language models in Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. And then use more powerful techniques like the Longformer, a transformer-based encoder, to assimilate more information and find the nearest neighbors of each candidate based on their political view and their background. The code and data for the project will be available here: ""

AB Metaheuristics have emerged as one of the prominent problem-solving methodologies to handle optimization problems as they can provide good quality solutions within acceptable time limits. Numerous studies have been conducted in the field of metaheuristics proposing novel algorithms, modifications in the existing ones, etc to improve the performance of the metaheuristic framework. The multi-population or island approach is one such modification where solutions are divided into smaller subpopulations and migrate from one subpopulation to another to share information. Though useful, this approach is often ignored due to additional parameters, the burden of tuning them, increased time complexity, additional task of deciding migration policy, migration ratio, etc. In the present work, we have proposed a novel framework to enhance the performance of existing population-based metaheuristic algorithms and named it Batch Metaheuristic. The present framework is easy to implement and understand, has no migration of solutions among batches, and is general in nature i.e can easily be incorporated with any population-based algorithm, such as a Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm, and others. It divides the set of solutions in each iteration into several batches that are individually exposed to the algorithm chosen with different parameter values. We included the batch approach in two well-established population-based metaheuristics, Genetic Algorithm, and Particle Swarm Optimization. The approach is tested over fifteen benchmark functions, five shifted benchmark functions, and three classical engineering problems. The results obtained confirm the better performance of the batch approach over its non-batch counterparts. This approach incurs numerous associated benefits when put to use.

AB Modeling snowflake movements as an optimization algorithm is a recently proposed idea with a straightforward formulation. In this paper, we proposed to use different formulations for the movements of the snowflakes and presented a new nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the same phenomenon. The algorithm is based on the forces that affect a snowflake during the snowfall and the collisions between them. We tested the algorithm on three benchmark sets, CEC 2017, CEC 2020 and CEC 2011 and compared its performance with PSO, WOA, BBO, GWO, BAT and MFO in solving these three benchmark sets. We evaluated the results both statistically and with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The evaluations shown that the proposed algorithm has well-balanced exploration and exploitation abilities and outperformed the other algorithms for all the comparison criteria except the execution time. Also, the pairwise comparisons indicated that it is more stable than the other algorithms in solving CEC 2017 and CEC 2020 benchmark problems.

AB Time series forecasting is widely used to predict future values in several applications, such as climate, industries demand, stock markets and business strategies. Fuzzy set based time series (FTS) forecasting models are widely used to solve forecasting problems because of fuzzy logic's ability to deal with uncertainties. But designing a FTS model can be a complex task since there are important hyperparameters to be defined that directly influence performance, mainly the number of fuzzy sets, model order, and membership function used. Therefore, this paper proposes ADPT2FTS, an interval type-2 FTS model that uses an Autonomous Data Partitioning Algorithm (ADP), capable of improving uncertainty handling and relying on an autonomous method for defining the number of fuzzy sets to be used. We also investigated how changing model order and membership function influenced forecasting accuracy to choose the best parameters to design the best performing model possible. ADPT2FTS performance was evaluated using two complex financial datasets: the European Brent Oil Prices (EBOP) and the Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX); and two benchmark time series in the literature: University of Alabama Enrollments and Yealy Sunspot. The proposed model was compared to "state-of-art" forecasting models in the literature, designed with several different working mechanisms such as type-1 and type-2 fuzzy logic, neural networks and regression algorithms. Results show that ADPT2FTS achieved better performance and lower error values in terms of RMSE and MAPE metrics.

AB Differential equations (DEs) are widely employed in the mathematical modelling of a wide range of scientific and engineering problems. The analytical solution of these DEs is typically unknown for a variety of practical problems of relevance. Several numerical methods have been developed over time to find the solution to such DEs and numerous new approaches are still being proposed daily. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising method for solving high-dimensional DEs. Due to the universal approximation capability of neural networks, there is no doubt that studies in this field will continue to grow in the near future. However, there is a need to understand the best-performing neural network architectures and algorithms that demonstrated their effectiveness and ability over traditional algorithms for solving various types of high-dimensional DEs. In this survey, we provide a review of deep learning algorithms classified as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) for solutions of DEs, that have been published in the last decade (between 2011 and 2022). The key purpose of this study is to explore the research papers published in the area of numerical solutions of DEs in order to get a deeper understanding of the current situation.

AB Constraint discovery in relational databases aims to find constraints that express dependency relationships among a set of attributes and has witnessed remarkable success in the applications of data cleaning, detecting data errors, and enhancing police and security operations. In this paper, we propose a new type of constraint, called distributional constraints (DCs), which leverages the attribute value distribution feature for intelligent auditing and security analysis. The constraint, which specifies the range of attribute values that most data follow, enables financial auditors, law enforcement, and security analysts to identify data with anomalous distributions and explain the reasons for such data anomalies. In the context of police and security applications, distributional constraints can help detect potential criminal activities, fraud, and other security threats by identifying unusual patterns in data. To efficiently discover distributional constraints, we propose an inference system to find the minimum coverage of a set of DCs. The efficient optimization technique BitVector indexing is also proposed to further speed up the distributional constraint discovery. We conduct experiments on 12 real datasets such as medical bills and credit card statements to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our solution. We show the performance of the discovery DCs and the effectiveness of using DCs for detecting abnormal data in different audit datasets.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB The development of AI systems represents a significant investment of funds and time. Assessment is necessary in order to determine whether that investment has paid off. Empirical evaluation of systems in which humans and AI systems act interdependently to accomplish tasks must provide convincing empirical evidence that the work system is learnable and that the technology is usable and useful. We argue that the assessment of human-AI (HAI) systems must be effective but must also be efficient. Bench testing of a prototype of an HAI system cannot require extensive series of large-scale experiments with complex designs. Some of the constraints that are imposed in traditional laboratory research just are not appropriate for the empirical evaluation of HAI systems. We present requirements for avoiding "unnecessary rigor." They cover study design, research methods, statistical analyses, and online experimentation. These should be applicable to all research intended to evaluate the effectiveness of HAI systems.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article
DE image segmentation; medical image processing
AB Medical image segmentation from noisy labels is an important task since obtaining high-quality annotations is extremely difficult and expensive. There are a lot of approaches proposed for such task. However, some issues like the overfitting on noisy annotations, the limited learning of boundary features, and no consideration of the corrupted local pixels are still not solved. Therefore, a novel approach named uncertainty-aware iterative learning (UaIL) is proposed for medical image segmentation with noisy labels. UaIL iteratively and jointly trains two deep networks using the original images and their argumented ones through a joint loss function including softened label loss, hard label loss and consistency loss, which encourages UaIL to produce segmentations that are robust to the perturbations in arbitrary semantic space. The uncertainty of labels is estimated based on the predictions in iterative learning, then the original labels are refined, which improves the learning of boundary features in segmentation. To avoid overfitting, a stopping strategy is designed based on the dice coefficient in iterative learning. Experiments on two public datasets verify the effectiveness of UaIL under different levels of annotation noise. Especially, when there are serious noises in the labels, the dice achieved by UaIL is 1.43% to 15.03% higher than the competing approaches on the two public datasets. The UaIL is further verified on a private dataset, which shows its ability of applying in the real application with noisy labels.

AB Existing applications of deep learning in computational imaging and microscopy mostly depend on supervised learning, requiring large-scale, diverse and labelled training data. The acquisition and preparation of such training image datasets is often laborious and costly, leading to limited generalization to new sample types. Here we report a self-supervised learning model, termed GedankenNet, that eliminates the need for labelled or experimental training data, and demonstrate its effectiveness and superior generalization on hologram reconstruction tasks. Without prior knowledge about the sample types, the self-supervised learning model was trained using a physics-consistency loss and artificial random images synthetically generated without any experiments or resemblance to real-world samples. After its self-supervised training, GedankenNet successfully generalized to experimental holograms of unseen biological samples, reconstructing the phase and amplitude images of different types of object using experimentally acquired holograms. Without access to experimental data, knowledge of real samples or their spatial features, GedankenNet achieved complex-valued image reconstructions consistent with the wave equation in free space. The GedankenNet framework also shows resilience to random, unknown perturbations in the physical forward model, including changes in the hologram distances, pixel size and illumination wavelength. This self-supervised learning of image reconstruction creates new opportunities for solving inverse problems in holography, microscopy and computational imaging.
   Microscopic imaging and holography aim to decrease reliance on labelled experimental training data, which can introduce biases, be time-consuming and costly to prepare, and may lack real-world diversity. Huang et al. develop a physics-driven self-supervised model that eliminates the need for labelled or experimental training data, demonstrating superior generalization on the reconstruction of experimental holograms of various samples.

AB This study proposes a stack framework of light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) for Taiwan stock market index prediction. Stock market predictions have been regarded as a challenging task, as the market is affected by several factors such as political events, general economic conditions, institutional investors' choices, movement of the global market, psychology of investors. We construct a rich feature set to capture the impacts of global markets, institutional investors' choices, and the psychology of investors. A feature selection algorithm is proposed to choose important feature subset and enhance the training performance. To further improve the prediction accuracy, we employ stacking strategy to combine multiple classifiers together. A 10-year period of the Taiwan stock exchange capitalization weighted stock index (TAIEX) is used to verify the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results suggest that our prediction model as well as the feature selection method can achieve good prediction performance.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article

ID MODEL
AB Underwater images are the most direct and effective ways to obtain underwater information. However, underwater images typically suffer from contrast reduction and colour distortion due to the absorption and scattering of water by light, which seriously limits the further development of underwater visual tasks. Recently, the convolutional neural network has been extensively applied in underwater image enhancement for its powerful local information extraction capabilities, but due to the locality of convolution operation, it cannot capture the global context well. Although the recently emerging Transformer can capture global context, it cannot model local correlations. Cformer is proposed, which is an Unet-like hybrid network structure. First, a Depth Self-Calibrated block is proposed to extract the local features of the image effectively. Second, a novel Cross-Shaped Enhanced Window Transformer block is proposed. It captures long-range pixel interactions while dramatically reducing the computational complexity of feature maps. Finally, the depth self-calibrated block and the cross-shaped enhanced window Transformer block are ingeniously fused to build a global-local Transformer module. Extensive ablation studies are performed on public underwater datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual components in the network. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons indicate that Cformer achieves superior performance compared to other competitive models.

AB This study presents a classification model that incorporates significant enhancements based on the Bayesian method and genetic algorithm (BGA). Firstly, the prior probabilities in each iteration are determined using the ratio of the number of elements in each group, obtained through clustering techniques, to the total number of elements in the training set. Secondly, an automatic selection process optimizes the training set to minimize classification errors. Finally, the traditional genetic algorithm operators are improved by utilizing the Bayes error as the objective function. These improvements combine to create an effective classification model. Additionally, the BGA demonstrates effective performance on real data using the established MATLAB procedure. A numerical example illustrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to existing methods. The study also applies the BGA for image classification using the Gabor filter, which extracts essential image features. The proposed model outperforms popular methods in classifying various numerical and image datasets. These applications highlight the potential of this study in real-world scenarios.

AB Civic engagement is increasingly becoming digital. The ubiquity of computing increases our technologically mediated interactions. Governments have instated various digitization efforts to harness these new facets of virtual life. What remains to be seen is if citizen political opinion, which can inform the inception and effectiveness of public policy, is being accurately captured. Civicbase is an open-source online platform that supports the application of Quadratic Voting Survey for Research (QVSR), a novel survey method. In this paper, we explore QVSR as an effective method for eliciting policy preferences, optimal survey design for prediction, Civicbase's functionalities and technology stack, and Personal AI, an emerging domain, and its relevance to modeling individual political preferences.

   STRATEGY
AB In this paper, a new staircase sinusoidal voltage synthesizer based on dc-dc boost converter and dc-ac multilevel inverter is proposed for dynamic voltage restorer to accurately compensate the power quality issues. The dc-dc boost converter which is connected to photovoltaic-based power supply system can provide required energy and high-gain voltage [2*(1-K)(-2)] via tracking the maximum power for the compensation process. The dc-ac multilevel inverter which their dc power sources have followed septenary geometric progression can provide high step staircase sinusoidal voltage [7((Nsw/6))] with low switch count. In this regard, the proposed staircase sinusoidal voltage synthesizer can effectively compensate the voltage disturbance conditions. In view of the fact that the compensator control system must properly operate so that the proposed voltage synthesizer reveals its step creation capability, an interval type-2 fuzzy controller is implemented to assist the power electronic part. The controller parameters have been optimally extracted using multi-objective stochastic fractal search algorithm to ensure the control process accuracy. To verify and validate the compensation capability of the proposed compensator, the simulation results have been focused on asymmetrical voltage disturbance conditions. Finally, the comparison and simulation results have strongly confirmed the high step creation and compensation capabilities of the proposed DVR.

ID IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB Breast cancer classification and segmentation play an important role in identifying and detecting benign and malignant breast lesions. However, segmentation and classification still face many challenges: 1) The characteristics of cancer itself, such as fuzzy edges, complex backgrounds, and significant changes in size, shape, and intensity distribution make accurate segment and classification challenges. 2) Existing methods ignore the potential relationship between classification and segmentation tasks, due to the classification and segmentation being treated as two separate tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, a novel Semantic-aware transformer (SaTransformer) for breast cancer classification and segmentation is proposed. Specifically, the SaTransformer enables doing the two takes simultaneously through one unified framework. Unlike existing well-known methods, the segmentation and classification information are semantically interactive, reinforcing each other during feature representation learning and improving the ability of feature representation learning while consuming less memory and computational complexity. The SaTransformer is validated on two publicly available breast cancer datasets - BUSI and UDIAT. Experimental results and quantitative evaluations (accuracy: 97.97%, precision: 98.20%, DSC: 86.34%) demonstrate that the SaTransformer outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Lightweight deep learning models for face recognition are becoming increasingly crucial for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as embedded systems or mobile devices. This paper presents a highly efficient and compact deep learning (DL) model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various face recognition benchmarks. The developed DL model employs one- or few-shot learning to obtain effective feature embeddings and draws inspiration from FaceNet with significant refinements to achieve a memory size of only 3.5 MB-about 30 times smaller than FaceNet-while maintaining high accuracy and real-time performance. The study demonstrates the model's effectiveness through extensive experiments, which include testing on public datasets and the model's ability to recognize occluded faces in uncontrolled environments using grayscale input images. Compared to the state-of-the-art lightweight models, the proposed model requires fewer FLOPs (0.06G), has a smaller number of parameters (1.2 M), and occupies a smaller model size (3.5 MB) while achieving a competitive level of recognition accuracy and real-time performance. The results show that the model is well-suited for deployment in embedded domains, including live entrance security checks, driver authorization, and in-class attendance systems. The entire code of FN8 is available on GitHub.

ID DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORK; INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION
AB Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a retinal proliferative disorder, and it is the primary cause of childhood blindness. Accurate and convenient automatic diagnostic tools are required to assist ophthalmologists in diagnosing ROP. Existing methods only extract information from fundus image captured from posterior angle, while images captured from other angles are ignored, which limits the performance of the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a graph-based feature fusion network (GFF-Net) that can jointly analyze multiple images and make full use of the relevant information between these images to diagnose the plus disease in ROP. The convolutional features of different fundus images are connected into a graph, where the edges of the graph model the correlation between these images. A graph-based feature fusion module is proposed to aggregate features from the constructed feature graph and produce the final prediction. We compared the proposed GFF-Net with state-of-the-art methods on a clinical dataset and a low-quality "attack dataset". The GFF-Net achieved superior performance compared to other methods on both datasets. The results show that the proposed GFF-Net could be more effective than existing methods in clinical practice.

ID NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; ADAPTIVE SIMILARITY
AB Data samples in real-world applications are not only related to high-dimensional features, but also related to each other. To fully exploit the interconnection between data samples, some recent methods embed latent representation learning into unsupervised feature selection and are proven effective. Despite superior performance, we observe that existing methods first predefine a similarity graph, and then perform latent representation learning based feature selection with this graph. Since fixed graph is obtained from the original feature space containing noisy features and the graph construction process is independent of the feature selection task, this makes the prefixed graph unreliable and ultimately hinders the efficiency of feature selection. To solve this problem, we propose joint learning of graph and latent representation for unsupervised feature selection (JGLUFS). Different from previous methods, we integrate adaptive graph construction into a feature selection method based on the latent representation learning, which not only reduces the impact of external conditions on the quality of graph but also enhances the connection between graph learning and latent representation learning for benefiting the feature selection task. These three basic tasks, including graph learning, latent representation learning and feature selection, cooperate with each other and lead to a better solution. An efficient algorithm with guaranteed convergence is carefully designed to solve the optimization problem of the algorithm.

AB Tackling traffic signal control through multi-agent reinforcement learning is a widely-employed approach. However, current state-of-the-art models have drawbacks: intersections optimize their own local rewards and cause traffic to waste time and fuel with a start-stop mode at each intersection. They also lack information sharing among intersections and their specialized policy hinders the ability to adapt to new traffic scenarios. To overcome these limitations, This work presents a centralized collaborative graph network (CCGN) with the core objective of a signal-free corridor once the traffic flows have waited at the entry intersection of the traffic intersection network on either side, the subsequent intersection gives the open signal as the traffic flows arrive. CCGN combines local policy networks (LPN) and global policy networks, where LPN employed at each intersection predicts actions based on Transformer and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In contrast, GPN is based on GCN and Q-network that receives the LPN states, traffic flow and road information to manage intersections to provide a signal-free corridor. We developed the Deep Graph Convolution Q-Network (DGCQ) by combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and GCN to achieve a signal-free corridor. DGCQ leverages GCN's intersection collaboration and DQN's information aggregation for traffic control decisions Proposed CCGN model is trained on the robust synthetic traffic network and evaluated on the real-world traffic networks that outperform the other state-of-the-art models. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is a robust incremental supervised learning algorithm. It has the best training and incremental learning time over all other classification algorithms. This feature is essential to online learning and knowledge acquisition when dealing with new and unknown situations. In this article, we propose an efficient method of online learning based on the KNN algorithm named hoKNN (hybrid online KNN), which we successfully applied to autonomous wall-following robot navigation. Our approach allowed the robot to effectively gain the ability to acquire new knowledge "on the fly." The proposed hoKNN resulted in high accuracy levels for live gathered data at 99.7%, with a 95% decrease in the error rate compared to the classic KNN algorithm, while maintaining a very low online learning time. It can rapidly learn from its previous mistakes (in real-time) and adapt to new situations with little overhead time. Moreover, our proposed hoKNN outperformed both the multilayer perceptron as a deep learning classification approach and Q-learning as a reinforcement learning approach in terms of accuracy and total time.

AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task for natural language processing, which aims to detect mentions of real-world entities from text and classifying them into predefined types. Recently, research on overlapped and discontinuous named entity recognition has received increasing attention. However, we note that few studies have considered both overlapped and discontinuous entities. In this paper, we proposed a novel sequence-to-sequence model that is capable of recognizing both overlapped and discontinuous entities based on machine reading comprehension. The model utilizes machine reading comprehension formulation to encode significant inferior information about the entity category. Then input sequence passes through a question-answering model to predict the mention relevance of the given source sentences to the query. Finally, we incorporate the mention relevance into the BART-based generation model. We conducted experiments on three type of NER datasets to show the generality of our model. The experimental results demonstrate that our model beats almost all the current top-performing baselines achieves a vast amount of performance boost over current SOTA models on overlapped and discontinuous NER datasets.

AB Renewable energy sources are seen as a sustainable solution to the problem of global energy security. Among the renewable energy sources, wave energy has great prospects for development in a few countries, including South Africa. However, South Africa's wave energy projects are still underinvested in practice compared to wind energy and solar PV. This paper investigates several questions related to the influence of both quantitative and qualitative factors on the effectiveness of wave energy projects (WEPs) and the appropriate placement for WEP in South Africa. For this purpose, a novel two-phase framework novel two-phase data envelopment analysis (DEA) supporting integrated multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework is proposed. The first phase aims to identify potential locations for WEPs and calculate the technical advantage of these locations using the DEA model. In the second phase, other qualitative criteria, which affect the sustainable development of WEPs, are identified. Based on expert surveys, potential locations are analyzed and ranked by a novel integrated MCDM approach called OPA-EDAS. In the proposed approach, the advantages of the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) are utilized to simultaneously determine the weight of the criteria and prioritize the alternatives. However, the results of OPA depend on the priorities of the experts participating in the assessment. Therefore, this study attempted to overcome that by integrating the EDAS technique to assess the expertise. Furthermore, the DEA model is applied to increase the objectivity of the results. In addition, the robustness of the study's findings is validated by comparing the location with upcoming WEPs in South Africa. The result shows that the coast of Cape Nature Walker Bay has the most effectiveness for South Africa's WEPs.

The methodology is performed in the platform of ontology creation and performs the classification analysis. The calculation analysis found the result, and the brain images were classified. The classification analysis of burnout people's brain images, separation of prolonged vigorous activities, and the ontology creation for treatment and prevention against burnout people's brain images were obtained. The analysis received the result, and the results of the precision, recall, storage, computation time, specificity, and classification of burnout people's brain images were obtained. Furthermore, all these Ontology analysis of Treatment and prevention and intermediate layers formation based on a hypothetical sense model had the prediction sensitivity (SN) over 50% and specificity (SP) over 90%. The Classification of Burnout People's Brain performance comparison shows that the proposed system is much more successful than existing methods, especially on a scoring accuracy of 98%.

ID SCORE
AB To date, multilabel learning has garnered attention increased from scholars and has a significant effect on practical applications; however, most feature selection models with classification margin cannot fully reflect the correlations between the feature and label sets. This work constructs a label enhancement-based feature selection method via ant colony optimization (ACO) on multilabel data. First, by combining the feature cosine distance and label distance of the samples, a global distance between the samples is presented, and an adjustment parameter is defined to dynamically regulate the label distance between the samples. The discriminant relation between the samples is presented to distinguish the homogeneous or heterogeneous samples of the target sample. An average classification margin-based adaptive neighborhood radius of the target sample is designed. Thus, a new adaptive fuzzy neighborhood rough set is proposed. Second, by integrating the algebraic and information viewpoints, the roughness degree is fused with the multilabel fuzzy neighborhood mutual information. The weight of each label is generated based on the label distribution of all the samples. Label enhancement-based fuzzy neighborhood mutual information can be determined to generate the final correlation of each feature and label set. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficient with an upper approximation will be applied to construct the pheromone initialization of the feature. Two metrics can be used as the heuristic information of the ACO to guide the ants to select significant features. Thus, a label enhancement-based multilabel feature subset selection methodology will be provided to obtain a superior set of features. The results from experiments confirm the capability of the proposed methodology in implementing significant classification effects on 13 datasets.

   CONSENSUS
AB This paper addresses distributed multi-sensor multi-object tracking based on probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. Due to the scalar fusion weights, existing distributed fusion methods only work well in cases where the information confidence within multi-object densities (MODs) returned by local filters remains unchanged over the object state space. Therefore, severe performance degradation can be observed as, in practice, the information confidence of an MOD is usually space-varying and can be utterly different due to the limited sensor abilities and various environment impacts. We make three contributions towards addressing this problem. Firstly, we propose a heterogeneous fusion method for multi-object Poisson process (MPP) MODs. The resulting MOD has a parallelizable structure that allows multiple clusters of sub-densities to be fused independently based on different sets of heterogeneous fusion weights. Secondly, a density-based heterogeneous fusion weights design method is proposed, in which the fusion weights are determined according to the relative information confidence of MODs. Lastly, to enhance the adaptability and robustness of the proposed fusion method, we extend it to decentralized sensor networks in conjunction with consensus and flooding protocols, respectively. The implementation of the proposed fusion algorithms using Gaussian approximation is also presented. The efficacy of the proposed fusion methods is demonstrated in various numerical experiments, including a challenging scenario in which each sensor in a decentralized network has dynamic detection probability and space-varying detection accuracy. In the experiments, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in distributed fusion. In fact, the Optimal Sub-Pattern Assignment (OSPA) distances returned by the proposed method are at least 38.8% less than other solutions.

AB Feature importance evaluation is one of the prevalent approaches to interpreting Machine Learning (ML) models. A drawback of using these methods for high-dimensional datasets is that they often lead to high-dimensional explanation output that hinders human analysis. This is especially true for explaining multimodal ML models, where the problem's complexity is further exacerbated by the inclusion of multiple data modalities and an increase in the overall number of features. This work proposes a novel approach to lower the complexity of feature-based explanations. The proposed approach is based on uncertainty quantification techniques, allowing for a principled way of reducing the number of modalities required to explain the model's predictions. We evaluated our method in three multimodal datasets comprising physiological time series. Results show that the proposed method can reduce the complexity of the explanations while maintaining a high level of accuracy in the predictions. This study illustrates an innovative example of the intersection between the disciplines of uncertainty quantification and explainable artificial intelligence.

AB List recommendation, an approach for recommending a set of items closely related to user preferences, plays a significant role in improving the user experience and has received growing attention in recent years. However, most existing models ignore list-level attributes and the heterogeneity of the interactions between the users and lists when predicting user preferences. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous graph neural network list recommendation (HGLR) model to bridge these gaps. First, a representation learning module based on pre-training techniques is developed to learn the embeddings of the lists, by encoding textual information and aggregating the features of the constituent items. We then transform the user-list interaction into a bipartite graph and incorporate the list attributes into a heterogeneous information network (HIN). Propagation-based embedding learning is subsequently performed to generate user and list representation based on the message-passing mechanism of the graph neural network. Finally, an attentive fusion layer is designed to obtain the global representations for the recommendation. We also develop a new large-scale dataset containing multiple types of side information to evaluate the list recommendation model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art list recommendation methods and achieves performance gains over 8.96% and 14.59% in Recall and NDCG, respectively, against the strongest baselines.

AB Lungs are crucial parts of the human body and can be captured as Chest x-ray images for disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, in many countries, hospitals and healthcare centers lack quali<overline>ed doctors for medical images-based diagnosis. Recent numerous advancements in arti<overline>cial intelligence have deployed with many medical applications to support doctors for disease diagnosis. In our research, we have leveraged YOLOv5s to identify and extract lungs and performed segmentation tasks with Fast R-CNN and YOLOv5 for comparison. The lung region abnormality detection models have pretty good average precision. For example, the YOLOv5 model outperforms both in terms of training time, prediction, and accuracy, with the AP@.5 and AP@.5:.95 metric values, 0.616 and 0.322 on 2,500 images of 5 abnormalities (aortic enlargement, cardiomegaly, lung opacity, pleural e (R) usion, and pulmonary <overline>brosis).

AB Sketch-RGB cross-modality person re-identification (ReID) is a challenging task that aims to match a sketch portrait drawn by a professional artist with a full-body photo taken by surveillance equipment to deal with situations where the monitoring equipment is damaged at the accident scene. However, sketch portraits only provide highly abstract frontal body contour information and lack other important features such as color, pose, behavior, etc. The difference in saliency between the two modalities brings new challenges to cross-modality person ReID. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream model for cross-modality person ReID, which is able to mine modality-invariant features to reduce the discrepancy between sketch and camera images end-to-end. More specifically, we propose a multi-spectrum image fusion (MSIF) method, which aims to exploit the image appearance changes brought by multiple spectrums and guide the network to mine modality-invariant commonalities during training. It only processes the spectrum of the input images without adding additional calculations and model complexity, which can be easily integrated into other models. Moreover, we introduce a joint structure via a generalized mean pooling (GMP) layer and a self-attention (SA) mechanism to balance background and texture information and obtain the regional features with a large amount of information in the image. To further shrink the intra-class distance, a weighted regularized triplet (WRT) loss is developed without introducing additional hyperparameters. The model was first evaluated on the PKU Sketch ReID dataset, and extensive experimental results show that the Rank-1/mAP accuracy of our method is 87.00%/91.12%, reaching the current state-of-the-art performance. To further validate the effectiveness of our approach in handling cross-modality person ReID, we conducted experiments on two commonly used IR-RGB datasets (SYSU-MM01 and RegDB). The obtained results show that our method achieves competitive performance. These results confirm the ability of our method to effectively process images from different modalities.

AB As a fast algorithm for training single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks, extreme learning machine (ELM) has been successfully applied to various classification and regression problems. In recent years, regularization techniques have been widely used in ELM to improve its stability, sparsity and generalization capability. In order to determine the appropriate number of hidden layer nodes, the ELM regularized by l(1/2) quasi-norm (L-1/2-ELM) was developed to prune the redundant hidden nodes. However, in multi-dimensional output tasks, L-1/2-ELM only removes redundant weights of hidden nodes but cannot guarantee the sparsity at the node level. In this paper, we present the L-2,L-1/2-ELM, which is regularized by L-2,L-1/2 quasi-norm to achieve sparsity in multi-dimensional output problems. With the generalization of L-1/2 regularization to L-2,L-1/2 regularization, L-2,L-1/2-ELM can prune the corresponding hidden nodes by setting some rows of the output weight matrix to zero. Since the proximal operator corresponding to L-2,L-1/2 regularization has a closed-form solution, the powerful alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed to achieve a fast solution of L-2,L-1/2-ELM. Furthermore, to face the challenge of distributed computing, we extend L-2,L-1/2-ELM to its distributed version, namely DL2,1/2-ELM. DL2,1/2-ELM is solved by the consensus ADMM algorithm. Experiments on multi-classification and multi-target regression datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve competitive sparsity without compromising accuracy.

AB Pseudo-labeling is an effective semi-supervised segmentation method. Most pseudo-labeling works were based on a common assumption: lower entropy means lower uncertainty. Hence many high entropy pseudo-labels are discarded and not involved in the training. Inadequate labeled data limit performance of model segmentation. In order to expand the labeled data capacity, we propose a new semi-supervised segmentation method, namely, different treatments of pixels in unlabeled images (DTP). Our DTP consists of three main components: labeled images segmentation, certain pixels segmentation, uncertain pixels segmentation. A sonar image with two different parallel segmentation networks will produce two one-hot segmentation maps. If the predictions of a pixel in the sonar image are consistent on two one-hot segmentation maps, this pixel is regarded as reliable in this segmentation and delineated as the certain pixel. On the contrary, if the prediction results are different, the pixel is delineated as the uncertain pixel. Then uncertain pixels are necessary to choose an advanced semi-supervised framework for label assignment to minimize the possible error propagation. Meanwhile, certain pixels are assessed in two extreme ways-radical segmentation and conservative segmentation. Compared with other methods, our method is novel in (1) indicating certain/uncertain pixels to expand the labeled data capacity (2) introducing other advanced semi-supervised methods for segmenting uncertain pixels to improve the segmentation performance. Experimental results show that our method achieves advanced semi-supervised segmentation performance in sonar dataset.

AB The energy demanding nature of deep learning (DL) has fueled the immense attention for neuromorphic architectures due to their ability to operate in a very high frequencies in a very low energy consumption. To this end, neuromorphic photonics are among the most promising research directions, since they are able to achieve femtojoule per MAC efficiency. Although electrooptical substances provide a fast and efficient platform for DL, they also introduce various noise sources that impact the effective bit resolution, introducing new challenges to DL quantization. In this work, we propose a quantization-aware training method that gradually performs bit reduction to layers in a mixed-precision manner, enabling us to operate lower-precision networks during deployment and further increase the computational rate of the developed accelerators while keeping the energy consumption low. Exploiting the observation that intermediate layers have lower-precision requirements, we propose to gradually reduce layers' bit resolutions, by normally distributing the reduction probability of each layer. We experimentally demonstrate the advantages of mixed-precision quantization in both performance and inference time. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate the proposed method in different tasks, architectures, and photonic configurations, highlighting its immense capabilities to reduce the average bit resolution of DL models while significantly outperforming the evaluated baselines.

DE Desktop object instance segmentation; Metric learning; Transformer-based
   fusion module; Multi-scale embedding loss
AB To perform object-specific tasks on the desktop, robots need to perceive different objects. The challenge is to calculate the pixel-wise mask for each object, even in the presence of occlusions and unseen objects. We take a step toward this problem by proposing a metric learning-based network called TRF-Net to perform desktop object instance segmentation. We design two ResNet-based branches to process the RGB and depth images separately. Then, we propose a Transformer-based fusion module called TranSE to fuse the features from both branches. This module also transfers the fused features to the decoder part, which helps generate fine-grained decoder features. After that, we propose a multi-scale feature embedding loss function called MFE loss to reduce the intra-class distance and increase the inter-class distance, which contributes to the feature clustering in embedding space. Due to the lack of large-scale real-world datasets for desktop objects, the proposed TRF-Net is trained with the synthetic dataset and tested with the small-scale real-world dataset. The target objects in the testing dataset do not present in the training dataset, ensuring the novelty of testing objects. We demonstrate that our method can produce accurate instance segmentation masks, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods on desktop object instance segmentation.

AB In real-world industrial applications, learning to recognize novel visual categories from a few samples is challenging and promising. Although some efforts have been made in the academic field for few-shot classification studies, there is still a lack of high-precision fine-grained few-shot classification models in some specific fields, especially in the fine-grained agricultural field. As far as we know, this study is the first work on meta-learning few-shot classification for fine-grained plant disease classification (specific to disease severity). We propose a multi-perspective hybrid attention meta-learning model based on a Batch Nuclear-norm constraint. The model explores discriminative features by focusing on key regions, and the hybrid attention module is divided into two sub-modules, soft attention model and patch-hard attention model. The discriminability and diversity constraint module is introduced in the loss function to constrain the Batch Nuclear-norm of the classification matrix, which improves the discriminative properties of the classification model and increases its diversity at the same time. In this paper, a large number of experiments have been carried out on multiple datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our work has better performance than state-of-the-art models. It can be said that our work is a valuable supplement to the domain-specific industrial application models.

AB A novel generalized modular MLI topology blends the unique advantages associated with existing MLIs to enhance the output voltage level incorporating a comparatively lesser number of power electronic components for similar performances. The unique features of the proposed topology pertain to lower distortion as well as total standing voltage (TSV) and best level-switch ratio (LSR) among the state-of-the-art MLIs. Extensive simulations using MATLAB/Simulation platforms as well as experimental models of single-phase 7-level, 9-level, 11-level, 13-level, and 15-level inverters validate the superiority of the proposed topology for pragmatic applications in uninterruptable power supplies, photovoltaic farms, wind farms, and fuel cells.

AB In this paper, two new uncertainty modeling concepts, namely strait soft set and strait rough set, between the structures of rough sets and soft sets, which will bring new perspectives to both theoretical and practical aspects, are presented. A reduction method of alternatives is given using strait soft sets. Another convenience arising from the structure of strait soft sets is that they allow the parameters to be combined. Thus, the fusion of parameters is defined and its use in soft set operations is demonstrated. Strait rough sets naturally contain the characteristics of the rough sets and also allow the parameters to be characterized. The strait soft set and strait rough set are supported by many examples and comparisons. In addition, a new decision-making approach based on the strait soft set and strait rough set is proposed and then followed by real-life applications to illustrate the computational processes.

AB Rationale refers to making human judgments, sets of reasons, or intentions to explain a particular decision. Nowadays, crowd-users argue and justify their decisions on social media platforms about market-driven software applications, thus generating a software rationale. Such rationale information can be of pivotal importance for the software and requirements engineers to enhance the performance of existing software applications by revealing end-users tactic knowledge to improve software designing and development decision-making. For this purpose, we proposed an automated approach to capture and analyze end-user reviews containing rationale information, focusing on low-rating applications in the amazon store using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning (ML) classification methods. In the literature, high-rating applications have been emphasized while ignoring low-rating software application that causes potential biasness. Therefore, we examined 59 comparatively low-ranked market-based software applications from the Amazon app store covering various software categories to capture and identify crowd-users justifications. Next, using a developed grounded theory and content analysis approach, we studied and recorded how crowd-users analyze and explain their rationale based on issues encountered, attacking or supporting arguments registered, and updating or uninstalling software applications. Also, to achieve the best results, an experimental study is conducted by comparing various ML and deep learning (DL) algorithms, i.e., MNB, LR, RF, MLP, KNN, AdaBoost, Voting, LSTM, and BILSTM classifiers on the end-users rationale data set by preprocessing the input data, applying feature engineering, balancing the data set, and then training and testing the ML algorithms with a standard cross-validation approach. We obtained satisfactory results with MLP, voting, LSTM, and RF Classifiers, having 93%, 93%, 91%, and 90% average accuracy, respectively. Also, we plot the ROC curves for the high-performing ML and DL classifiers to identify and capture classifiers yielding the best performance with an under-sampling or oversampling balancing approach. The proposed research approach outerperforms the existing rationale approaches with better Precision, Recall, and F-measure values. Additionally, the paper discusses various aspects of the proposed approach by extending it in multiple directions to be utilized by software developers and vendors to help improve the performance of existing software applications.

AB In the paper, we first explore a novel problem of training the robust Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against noisy graphs and noisy labels. To the problem, we propose a general Self-supervised Robust Graph Neural Network framework that consists of three modules: graph structure learning, sample selection, and self-supervised learning. Specifically, we first employ a graph structure learning approach to obtain an optimal graph structure. Next, using this structure, we use a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels that represent the clusters. We then design a sample selection strategy based on these pseudo-labels to select nodes with clean labels. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised learning technique where low-level layer parameters are shared with GNNs to predict pseudo-labels. We jointly train the graph structure learning module, the GNNs model, and the self-supervised model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our methods compared with state-of-the-art methods for semi-supervised node classification under noisy graphs and noisy labels.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Heterogeneous graph representation; Global homogeneous neighborhood;
   Multiview learning
AB Multiview learning has caught the interest of many graph researchers because it can learn richer information about graphs from different views. Recently, multiview learning, as a novel paradigm in learning, has been widely applied to learn nodes representation of heterogeneous graphs, such as MVSE, HeMI, etc., they only utilize the local homogeneous neighborhood information of nodes, which degrades the quality of nodes representation. We are aware that the heterogeneous graph representation aims to drive the representation of a node to be near the homogeneous neighbors that are similar to it in the heterogeneous graph and far wary from heterogeneous neighbors. Besides, in the heterogeneous graph, linked nodes are more likely to be dissimilar, but remote nodes may have some similarities. Therefore, we can move the locality of a node to discover more homogenous neighbors' information to improve the quality of node representation. In this work, we propose an unsupervised heterogeneous graph embedding technique that is simple yet efficient; and devise a systematic way to learn node embeddings from the local and global views of the homogeneous neighborhood of nodes by introducing a regularization framework that minimizes the disagreements among the local and global node embeddings under the specific meta-path. Inspired by Personal PageRank graph diffusion, we expand an infinite meta path-based restart random walk to obtain global homogenous neighbors of nodes and construct a meta path-based diffusion matrix to represent the relation between global homogenous neighbors and nodes. Finally, we employ mini-batch gradient descent to train our model to reduce computational consumption. Experimental findings demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide variety of baselines on different datasets when it comes to node classification and node clustering tasks, with a particularly impressive 7.22% improvement over the best baseline on the ACM dataset.

AB Bangla Optical Character Recognition (OCR) poses a unique challenge due to the presence of hundreds of diverse conjunct characters formed by the combination of two or more letters. In this paper, we propose two novel grapheme representation methods that improve the recognition of these conjunct characters and the overall performance of OCR in Bangla. We have utilized the popular Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network architecture and implemented our grapheme representation strategies to design the final labels of the model. Due to the absence of a large-scale Bangla word-level printed dataset, we created a synthetically generated Bangla corpus containing 2 million samples that are representative and sufficiently varied in terms of fonts, domain, and vocabulary size to train our Bangla OCR model. To test the various aspects of our model, we have also created 6 test protocols. Finally, to establish the generalizability of our grapheme representation methods, we have performed training and testing on external handwriting datasets. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of our novel approach. Furthermore, our synthetically generated training dataset and the test protocols are made available to serve as benchmarks for future Bangla OCR research.

AB Although deep learning makes great success in increasing the accuracy for long sequence time-series forecasting, its complex neural network structure, which comprises many different types of layers and each layer containing hundreds and thousands of neurons, challenges the computing and memory capability of embedded platforms. This paper proposes a lightweight and efficient neural network called TTFNet, which forecasts long time series using three types of features (i.e., the Trend, Temporal attention, and Frequency attention) extracted from raw time series. In TTFNet, we perform a pooling operation on the historical data in a recent time window to extract a general trend, use a multi-layer perceptron to discover the temporal correlation between data as temporal attention, and apply the fast Fourier transforms on data to obtain frequency information as frequency attention. Each feature is separately extracted from its neural network branch with an output result, and we weight the three results to generate the final prediction while optimal weights are learnt. Also, the three prediction results can run in parallel since they are independent from one another. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the memory overhead and runtime by 62% and 81% of the five counterpart methods on average while achieving comparable performance.

AB Multi-metric learning is important for improving performance of learners. For complex data, multi metric learning algorithms need intensive research. Moreover, the existing multi-metric learning methods may lead to the distance not being comparable. To solve these shortcomings and characterize better complexity data, we propose a novel multi-metric learning framework, where each class is divided into several clusters, and then a local metric and two concentric hypers-pheres are trained jointly in a cluster, such that the samples of the same cluster distribute within one hypersphere, and the classification margin are as large as possible simultaneously. This will leads to intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. During the test phase, the relative distance in learned metric space is designed to make classification decisions. A new example is classified to the class of its closest hyper-sphere center. This ensures that the comparison of distances is meaningful and avoids effectively the limitation of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifiers. Moreover,some important properties the proposed algorithm are analyzed theoretically. Further, an alternating iterative algorithm is developed to solve the problem. Numerical experiments are carried out on different scales and types datasets. Experiment results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In knowledge graph embedding, an attempt is made to embed the objective facts and relationships expressed in the form of triplets into multidimensional vector space, facilitating various applications, such as link prediction and question answering. Structure embedding models focus on the graph structure while the importance of language semantics in inferring similar entities and relations is ignored. Semantic embedding models use pretrained language models to learn entity and relation embeddings based on text information, but they do not fully exploit graph structures that reflect relation patterns and mapping attributes. Structure and semantic information in knowledge graphs represent different hierarchical properties that are indispensable for comprehensive knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a general knowledge graph embedding framework named SSKGE, which considers both the graph structure and language semantics and learns these two complementary characteristics to integrate entity and relation representations. To compensate for semantic embedding approaches that ignore the graph structure, we first design a structure loss function to explicitly model the graph structure attributes. Second, we leverage a pretrained language model that has been fine-tuned by the structure loss to guide the structure embedding approaches in enhancing the semantic information they lack and obtaining universal knowledge representations. Specifically, guidance is provided by a distance function that makes the spatial distribution of the two types of graph embeddings have a certain similarity. SSKGE significantly reduces the time cost of using a pretrained language model to complete a knowledge graph. Common knowledge graph embedding models such as TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, PairRE, and HousE have achieved better results with multiple datasets, including FB15k, FB15k-237, WN18, and WN18RR, using the SSKGE framework. Extensive experiments and analyses have verified the effectiveness and practicality of SSKGE.

AB It is of great significance to compress neural network models so that they can be deployed on resource-constrained embedded mobile devices. However, due to the lack of theoretical guidance for non-salient network components, existing model compression methods are inefficient and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a new pruning method to achieve model compression. By exploring the rank ordering of the feature maps of convolutional layers, we introduce the concept of sensitive layers and treat layers with more low-rank feature maps as sensitive layers. We propose a new algorithm for finding sensitive layers while using reinforcement learning deterministic strategies to automate pruning for insensitive layers. Experimental results show that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art in floating-point operations and parameter reduction, with lower precision loss. For example, using ResNet-110 on CIFAR-10 achieves a 62.2% reduction in floating-point operations by removing 63.9% of parameters. When testing ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our method reduces floating-point operations by 53.8% by deleting 39.9% of the parameters.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Residual Network (ResNet) is a distinguished network structure in deep learning, and its layers can be profound. We theoretically explore the mathematics characteristics of the ResNet, in particular, to pay attention to the gradient information, which is a powerful and straightforward mathematical tool for analysing the properties of ResNet, such as the gradients of the loss function with respect to the input and the weight parameters and the gradient of the entry of the logits with respect to the input. A theorem about the explicit matrix expression of gradients in Resnet is given in this work. A rigorous mathematical and logical derivation of the theorem is obtained in detail by the matrix derivative definition and matrix differentiation. We further provide explicit matrix expressions of some deep learning algorithms in ResNet, including backpropagation, gradient-based adversarial attacks, and gradient-based saliency maps. Furthermore, the reasons why the ResNet network works are analysed. Finally, experimental results are provided to verify the correctness and efficiency of the proposed theorem.

AB Stress is a common feeling in people's day-to-day life, especially at work, being the cause of several health problems and absenteeism. Despite the difficulty in identifying it properly, several studies have established a correlation between stress and perceivable human features. The problem of detecting stress has attracted significant attention in the last decade. It has been mainly addressed through the analysis of physiological signals in the execution of specific tasks in controlled environments. Taking advantage of technological advances that allow to collect stress-related data in a non-invasive way, the goal of this work is to provide an alternative approach to detect stress in the workplace without requiring specific controlled conditions. To this end, a video-based plethysmography application that analyses the person's face and retrieves several physiological signals in a non-invasive way was used. Moreover, in an initial phase, additional information that complements and labels the physiological data was obtained through a brief questionnaire answered by the participants. The data collection pilot took place over a period of two months, having involved 28 volunteers. Several stress detection models were developed; the best trained model achieved an accuracy of 86.8% and a F1 score of 87% on a binary stress/non-stress prediction.

AB Image foresting transform (IFT) is a graph-based framework to develop image operators based on optimum connectivity between a root set and the remaining nodes, according to a given path-cost function. Oriented image foresting transform (OIFT) was proposed as an extension of some seeded IFT-based segmentation methods to directed graphs, enabling them to support the processing of global object properties, such as connectedness, shape constraints, boundary polarity, and hierarchical constraints, allowing their customization to a given target object. OIFT lies in the intersection of generalized graph cut and general fuzzy connectedness frameworks, inheriting their properties. Its returned segmentation is optimal, with respect to an appropriate graph cut measure, among all segmentations satisfying the given constraints. In this work, we propose differential oriented image foresting transform, which allows multiple OIFT executions for different root sets, making the processing time proportional to the number of modified nodes. Experimental results show considerable efficiency gains over the sequential flow of OIFTs in image segmentation, while maintaining a good treatment of tie zones. We also demonstrate that the differential flow makes it feasible to incorporate the prior knowledge about the maximum allowable size for the segmented object, thus avoiding false positive errors in the segmentation of multi-dimensional images. We also propose an algorithm to efficiently create a hierarchy map that encodes area-constrained OIFT results for all possible thresholds, facilitating the quick selection of the object of interest.

AB This paper addresses a variant of the Job Shop Scheduling Problem with makespan minimisation where uncertainty in task durations is taken into account and modelled with intervals. A novel Artificial Bee Colony algorithm is proposed where the classical layout is simplified, increasing the algorithm's speed and reducing the number of parameters to set up. We also take into account the fundamental principles of exploration around a local solution and attraction to a global solution to improve diversity in the hive. The increase on speed and diversity allows to include a Local Search phase to better exploit promising areas of the search space. A parametric analysis is conducted and the contribution of the new strategies is analysed. The results of the new approach are competitive with those obtained with previous methods in the literature, but taking less runtime. The addition of Local Search improves the results even further, outperforming the best-known ones from the literature. An additional sensitivity study is conducted to assess the advantages of considering uncertainty and how increasing it affects the solution's robustness.

ID INFERENCE; BIAS
AB Association between alcohol intake and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk has been explored in several observational studies, but the results are still controversial. These associations may be biased by reverse causation or confounded by other environmental exposures. To avoid potential biases, we used Mendelian randomization (MR) method to evaluate whether alcohol intake is the causal risk factor for COVID-19. Two-sample MR analyses were performed utilizing summary data from the UK Biobank with 38,984 COVID-19 patients and 1,644,784 control participants. Both inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and genetic risk score (GRS) methods were applied to estimate the relationship including COVID-19 vs. general population, hospitalized COVID-19 vs. not hospitalized COVID-19, hospitalized COVID-19 vs. general population, and severe COVID-19 vs. general population. Additionally, we conducted various sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of assumptions on the findings and ensure the robustness of the results. Using 80 single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables, we found that alcohol intake was not significantly associated with the occurrence of COVID-19 in both IVW and GRS methods (IVW: beta = 0.0372; 95% CI - 0.1817 to 0.2561; P = 0.74; GRS: beta = 0.0372, 95% CI - 0.1737 to 0.2481, P = 0.73). Furthermore, similar results were also observed in comparison hospitalized COVID-19 with not hospitalized COVID-19 (IVW: beta = - 0.3625; 95% CI - 1.4151 to 0.6900; P = 0.50; GRS: beta = - 0.3625, 95% CI - 1.3633 to 0.6383, P = 0.48), hospitalized COVID-19 with general population (IVW: beta = - 0.1203; 95% CI - 0.5997 to 0.3591; P = 0.62; GRS: beta = - 0.1203, 95% CI - 0.5352 to 0.2946, P = 0.57), and severe COVID-19 with general population (IVW: beta = 0.2963; 95% CI - 0.3682 to 0.9607; P = 0.38; GRS: beta = 0.2963, 95% CI - 0.3240 to 0.9166, P = 0.35). Besides, the heterogeneity and sensitivity tests suggested absence of bias due to pleiotropy. Our results highlight no evidence to support the causal role of alcohol consumption in COVID-19 risk. Further large-scale prospective studies are warranted to replicate our findings.

AB This paper analyses a new hybrid paradigm resulting from the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), commonly referred to as drones, in logistics and distribution processes. This work is motivated by a real application, where the company Connect Robotics, the first drone delivery provider in Portugal, made a partnership with a pharmacy located at a rural region to start implementing the delivery of medicines by drone. The pharmacy receives orders throughout the day and has to deliver in the same day with tight lead-times. The resulting problem is modelled as a Dynamic Parallel Drone Scheduling Vehicle Routing Problem with Lead-Time. A solution method is devised to solve it, thus helping the pharmacist to plan the car and drone delivery routes during the day. The results obtained on real instances revealed that the solution method is effective when compared to the optimal solutions of the static version of the problem, since the dynamic solution only differs, on average, about 7% from the static one. Moreover, some managerial insights about the impact of adding drones to the distribution operation are discussed, namely the economic and environmental impacts with cost savings up to 41% and reduction of monthly CO2 emissions of 310 kg, the use of spare batteries which increase the benefit from 16% to 41%, and same-day versus next-day delivery.

AB Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is machine learning task to recognize samples from classes that are not observed during training. Transductive ZSL (TZSL) is a more realistic and effective paradigm that leverages unlabeled unseen data during training to reduce the bias towards seen classes. However, most existing TZSL methods neglect the information gap between visual and semantic spaces, and thus fail to generate distribution-consistent unseen features. To address this issue, we propose a novel TZSL approach named Anchor-based Discriminative Dual Distribution Calibrated Feature Generative Network (AD3C-FGN), which performs anchor-based distribution calibration in both visual and semantic spaces for improving generalization ability of the model. In AD3C-FGN, we adopt conditional generative adversarial network with an unseen discriminator to construct a Y-shape generation model that mitigates the domain shift problem. Moreover, an AD3C module is elaborated for calibrating the distribution of generated and real samples in both visual and semantic spaces with real sample anchors, and also enhance the discriminability of the generated samples. AD3C enforces the generated sample to be closer to its homogenous anchor but farther away from inhomogeneous anchors in both spaces. Extensive experimental results on six popular ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves promising performances in different settings. The source codes of our model have been released onhttps://github.com/ZYi-CQU/AD3C-FGN.

AB The emergence of the vehicular network makes the early road safety warning become possible because vehicles can retrieve road safety information via the vehicular network. The topology of the vehicular network is frequently fragmented due to some reasons such as vehicle mobility. To guarantee communication continuity, vehicular data is usually uploaded to infrastructures so that vehicles can download data from these infrastructures. However, in some places such as suburban parts of a city, infrastructures are sparsely deployed, which leads to long delays of data delivery and failures of data reception. Nowadays, resources of parking vehicles are not fully utilized, so we are motivated to exploit parking vehicles to work as virtual infrastructures and provide data for driving vehicles. Based on this idea, we propose a vehicular Data Delivery based on Virtual Infrastructures (DDVI) and aim to reduce data delivery delays and failures. In DDVI, parking vehicles in the peripheral area of a parking lot are elected as gateways so that driving vehicles on the roads surrounding the parking lot can rely on gateways and name-centric reverse paths to share data from the nearest provider via one data delivery process. DDVI is evaluated, and the experimental results demonstrate its strengths.

AB Convolutional and Transformer models have achieved remarkable results for Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR). However, the tremendous memory and computation consumption of these models restricts their usage in resource-limited scenarios. Knowledge distillation, as an effective model compression technique, has received great research focus on the SISR task. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient SISR method via hybrid knowledge distillation from intermediate layers, termed HKDSR, which leverages the knowledge from frequency information into that RGB information. To accomplish this, we first pre-train the teacher with multiple intermediate upsampling layers to generate the intermediate SR outputs. We then construct two kinds of intermediate knowledge from the Frequency Similarity Matrix (FSM) and Adaptive Channel Fusion (ACF). FSM aims to mine the relationship of frequency similarity between the Ground-truth (GT) HR image, and the intermediate SR outputs of teacher and student by Discrete Wavelet Transformation. ACF merges the intermediate SR output of the teacher and GT HR image in a channel dimension to adaptively align the intermediate SR output of the student. Finally, we leverage the knowledge from FSM and ACF into reconstruction loss to effectively improve student performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HKDSR on different benchmark datasets and network architectures.

AB In recent years, computer vision-based methods have been widely used in steel defect detection. Traditional image detection methods mainly rely on manually extracted features, resulting in poor generalization. Deep learning methods are sensitive to the number of samples, and the network structure design relies heavily on manual experience. To address these problems, a backbone network search algorithm based on evolutionary topology is proposed in this paper for crack detection on continuous casting surfaces. Firstly, a variable-length genetic encoding scheme is designed for industrial defect problems with different data complexity, which can improve the applicability of the algorithm and extend the search space. Secondly, to effectively solve the channel redundancy problem in densely connected CNNs, a random pruning strategy for network connection channels is proposed to reduce the topological space and the complexity of the model. Finally, a computational resource allocation mechanism based on a dynamic surrogate model is devised. The surrogate model predicts the individual performance to ensure that computational resources can be concentrated on individuals with better quality. In addition to the steel crack image dataset, the proposed method also uses the workpiece crack image dataset for a supplementary experiment. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better detection performance with fewer computational resources compared to manually designed deep learning algorithms and classical approaches that use evolutionary algorithms to search network architectures.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the main challenges of cognitive science is to explain the representation of conceptual knowledge and the mechanisms involved in evaluating the similarities between these representations. Theories that attempt to explain this phenomenon should account for the fact that conceptual knowledge is not static. In line with this thinking, many studies suggest that the representation of a concept changes depending on context. Traditionally, concepts have been studied as vectors within a geometric space, sometimes called Semantic-Vector Space Models (S-VSMs). However, S-VSMs have certain limitations in emulating human biases or context effects when the similarity of concepts is judged. Such limitations are related to the use of a classical geometric approach that represents a concept as a point in space. Recently, some theories have proposed the use of sequential projections of subspaces based on Quantum Probability Theory (Busemeyer and Bruza, 2012; Pothos et al., 2013). They argue that this theoretical approach may facilitate accounting for human similarity biases and context effects in a more natural way. More specifically, Pothos and Busemeyer (2011) proposed the Quantum Similarity Model (QSM) to determine expectation in conceptual spaces in a non-monotonic logic frame. To the best of our knowledge, previous data-driven studies have used the QSM subspaces in a unidimensional way. In this paper, we present a data-driven method to generate these conceptual subspaces in a multidimensional manner using a traditional S-VSM. We present an illustration of the method taking Tversky's classical examples to explain the effects of Asymmetry, Triangular Inequality, and the Diagnosticity by means of sequential projections of those conceptual subspaces.

AB Many important engineering optimization problems require a strong and simple optimization algorithm to achieve the best solutions. In 2020, Rao introduced three non-parametric algorithms, known as Rao algorithms, which have garnered significant attention from researchers worldwide due to their simplicity and effectiveness in solving optimization problems. In our simulation studies, we have developed a new version of the Rao algorithm called the Fully Informed Search Algorithm (FISA), which demonstrates acceptable performance in optimizing real-world problems while maintaining the simplicity and non-parametric nature of the original algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested FISA approach by applying it to optimize the shifted benchmark functions, such as those provided in CEC 2005 and CEC 2014, and by using it to design mechanical system components. We compare the results of FISA to those obtained using the original RAO method. The outcomes obtained indicate the efficacy of the proposed new algorithm, FISA, in achieving optimized solutions for the aforementioned problems. The MATLAB Codes of FISA are publicly available at https://github.com/ebrahimakbary/FISA.

AB Arbitrary style transfer (AST) has garnered considerable attention for its ability to transfer styles infinitely. Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they may overlook style consistencies and fail to capture crucial style patterns, leading to inconsistent style transfer (ST) caused by minor disturbances. To tackle this issue, we conduct a mathematical analysis of inconsistent ST and develop a style inconsistency measure (SIM) to quantify the inconsistencies between generated images. Moreover, we propose a consistent AST (CAST) framework that effectively captures and transfers essential style features into content images. The proposed CAST framework incorporates an intersection-of-union-preserving crop (IoUPC) module to obtain style pairs with minor disturbance, a self-attention (SA) module to learn the crucial style features, and a style inconsistency loss regularization (SILR) to facilitate consistent feature learning for consistent stylization. Our proposed framework not only provides an optimal solution for consistent ST but also outperforms existing methods when embedded into the CAST framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CAST framework can effectively transfer style patterns while preserving consistency and achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

AB Predicting software defects is an important task during software testing phase, especially for allocating appropriate resources and prioritizing testing tasks. Typically, classification algorithms are used to accomplish this task by using previously collected datasets. However, these datasets suffer from imbalanced label distribution where clean modules outnumber defective modules. Traditional classification algorithms cannot handle this nature in defect datasets because they assume the datasets are balanced. Failing to address this problem, the classification algorithm will produce a prediction biased towards the majority label. In the literature, there are several techniques designed to address this problem and most of them focus on data re-balancing. Recently, ensemble class imbalance techniques have emerged as an opposing approach to data rebalancing approaches. Regarding the software defect prediction, there are no studies examining the performance of ensemble class imbalance learning against data re-balancing approaches. This paper investigates the efficiency of ensemble class imbalance learning for software defect prediction. We conducted a comprehensive experiment that involved 12 datasets, six classifiers, nine class imbalance techniques, and 10 evaluation metrics. The experiments showed that ensemble approaches, particularly the Under Bagging technique, outperform traditional data re-balancing approaches, particularly when dealing with datasets that have high defect ratios.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Long-term target tracking; Tracking algorithm; Uncertainty estimation
   method; Adaptive model-updating method
AB In recent years, tracking algorithms based on correlation filtering have been widely considered because of their high real-time performance. However, most of these algorithms do not consider the reliability of tracking results; thus, model drift is often a challenge in long-term target tracking. Moreover, the target is significantly occluded or disappears in long-term target tracking, hence the need for research to address such complexities. This paper proposes a long-term tracking framework comprising a tracking and re-detection module. The tracking module is based on the efficient convolution operator target-tracking algorithm (ECO) (Danelljan et al. in Proc IEEE Conf Comput Vis Pattern Recognit, 1). To redetect a lost target, a tracking uncertainty estimation method is developed that evaluates the tracking results of each image. Furthermore, an adaptive model-updating method is proposed, which can reduce the number of model updates and improve the robustness of the tracking algorithm. The model is inspired by long and short-term memory pool mechanisms of the brain, applying both mechanisms to the traditional tracking algorithm to improve long-term tracking. The memory model is effectively integrated into a brain-inspired visual long-term tracker through mutual learning and inspiration from computer and biological vision. In addition, the brain-inspired visual model can be made bio-cognitive on a small hardware platform with limited computing power. Central processing unit (CPU)-based experiments using two data sets, UAV20L (Mueller et al. in Eur Conf Comput Vision, 2) and UAV123 (Wu et al. in Proc IEEE Conf Comput Vis Pattern Recognit, 3), confirmed that the proposed method runs faster than 30fps. Furthermore, the long-term tracking test using the UAV20L data set showed that the proposed method performs better than any other method by 39%. Compared with conventional tracking methods, the proposed method has better performance in terms of coverage rate and positioning accuracy.

DE Leakage delay; Self-connection delay; Unequal delays; Hopf bifurcation;
   Fractional-order BAM neural network
AB The bidirectional associative memory (BAM) neural network has the capability to store hetero-associative pattern pairs, which has high requirements for stability. This paper inquires into Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order bidirectional associative memory neural network (FOBAMNN) and implants three types of delays into the FOBAMNN. Namely leakage delay, self-connection delay, and communication delay, both of which are unequal. Drawing support from matrix eigenvalue theory, stability theory of fractional differential equations and bifurcation technology, The delay-dependent stability criterion and bifurcation point of the model are established by exploiting the characteristic polynomial. Afterwards, the self-connection delay or leakage delay is selected as the bifurcation parameter, and the unselected delay of the two is fixed in its stable interval, so as to obtain the condition of bifurcation. The results show that different types of delay affect the stability of the system. Simultaneously, once the delay outreaches the critical value of bifurcation, the stability of the model will be wrecked. Thereupon, in the application, we should adopt small delays to maintain the stability of the system. We illustrate that the leakage delay and self-connection delay can affect the stability of FOBAMNN. And the calculation method of the critical value of the delay will also be given. At length, the authenticity of the developed key fruits is elucidated via numerical simulations.

TI PIDray: A Large-Scale X-ray Benchmark for Real-World Prohibited Item
   Detection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article
DE Prohibited item dataset; Object detection; Instance segmentation;
   Multi-label classification
AB Automatic security inspection relying on computer vision technology is a challenging task in real-world scenarios due to many factors, such as intra-class variance, class imbalance, and occlusion. Most previous methods rarely touch the cases where the prohibited items are deliberately hidden in messy objects because of the scarcity of large-scale datasets, hindering their applications. To address this issue and facilitate related research, we present a large-scale dataset, named PIDray, which covers various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially for deliberately hidden items. In specific, PIDray collects 124, 486 X-ray images for 12 categories of prohibited items, and each image is manually annotated with careful inspection, which characterizes it, to our best knowledge, with the largest volume and varieties of annotated images with prohibited items to date. Meanwhile, we propose a general divide-and-conquer pipeline to develop baseline algorithms on PIDray. Specifically, we adopt the tree-like structure to suppress the influence of the long-tailed issue in the PIDray dataset, where the first course-grained node is tasked with the binary classification to alleviate the influence of head category, while the subsequent fine-grained node is dedicated to the specific tasks of the tail categories. Based on this simple yet effective scheme, we offer strong task-specific baselines across object detection, instance segmentation, and multi-label classification tasks and verify the generalization ability on common datasets (e.g., COCO and PASCAL VOC). Extensive experiments on PIDray demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against current state-of-the-art methods, especially for deliberately hidden items. Our benchmark and codes are available at .

AB This work examined whether a virtual drilling task can be appropriately simulated using combinations of sound, and kinesthetic stimuli obtained with movement of a basic 2D mouse in the absence of a haptic device. An experiment was conducted where participants were asked to drill a virtual block of wood under different sound conditions using a standard computer mouse, or keyboard. Although preliminary and greater work remains, the results of these experiments indicate that kinesthetic cues can be used to provide a suitable perceptual drilling experience without a haptic device. This preliminary work has provided a greater understanding of virtual drilling perception using traditional computer interfaces in the absence of haptic devices. This is particularly important when considering remote learning where trainees may be able to practice various psychomotor-based skills at home with commonly available computer hardware and devices.

AB Amidst the COVID-19 humanitarian catastrophe, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are premier technologies in the healthcare domain that have emerged to a great extent. This global health emergency highlights the need to bolster current healthcare systems for future preparedness. Conspicuously, the current paper presents a non-invasive AI-empowered model for passive health monitoring and predicting viral C-19 infection in the home environment. It consists of four notable layers: fully automated data acquisition, data analysis and Bayesian probabilistic classification, temporal COVID-19 severity prediction, and communication layer. These layers include IoT sensors embedded in the intelligent toilet system to collect required data, processes and analyses of the urine parametric data at the fog layer, and forecasting the COVID-19 severity using the XGBoost machine learning model at the cloud layer. The model has been evaluated over 53,550 data instances in a simulated environment for implementation purposes. The results implied that the proposed AI framework outperformed state-of-the-art strategies in terms of temporal approximation (94.53 s), reliability (92.69%), stability (0.89%), and predictive performance analysis (95.26%) metrics.

AB Mammography is one of the most effective tools radiologists use to detect breast cancer early, as it can detect cancer up to ten years before it manifests. The accuracy of breast cancer segmentation using computer aided design (CAD) systems is challenged by several factors, such as insufficient data for model training and data complexity. For example, mammography images are symmetrical by nature and appear complex to computer vision models, making accurate segmentation difficult. Data augmentation techniques are employed by researchers to help computer vision models preserve the invariance and equivariance features of transformed input images. However, these techniques have been insufficient and incur a computational cost. To improve the data efficiency of the computer vision models, this study proposes a model that combines the functionalities of the Mask Region Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask-RCNN) and Group Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNN) to provide highly accurate breast cancer segmentation. The GCNN preserves the invariant rotation of the transformed mammography images, increases weight sharing and the expressive capacity of the model, and minimizes computational costs. Our proposed model was applied to two mammography datasets, INbreast and MIAS. It achieved competitive results in terms of accuracy, Dice coefficient, Jaccard index, specificity, and sensitivity of 99.01%, 86.63%, 87.76%, 99.24%, and 98.55%, respectively, compared to conventional architectures.

AB Although social robots equipped with visual devices may leak user information, countermeasures for ensuring privacy are not readily available, making visual privacy protection problematic. In this article, a semi-supervised learning algorithm is proposed for visual privacy behaviour recognition based on an improved generative adversarial network for social robots; it is called PBR-GAN. A 9-layer residual generator network enhances the data quality, and a 10-layer discriminator network strengthens the feature extraction. A tailored objective function, loss function, and strategy are proposed to dynamically adjust the learning rate to guarantee high performance. A social robot platform and architecture for visual privacy recognition and protection are implemented. The recognition accuracy of the proposed PBR-GAN is compared with Inception_v3, SS-GAN, and SF-GAN. The average recognition accuracy of the proposed PBR-GAN is 85.91%, which is improved by 3.93%, 9.91%, and 1.73% compared with the performance of Inception_v3, SS-GAN, and SF-GAN respectively.

AB Tongue diagnosis is a useful process in traditional Chinese medicine to assess diseases non-invasively by visually inspecting the tongue and its various properties. In this study, we developed an automated tongue diagnosis system with a mobile app for the general public. The image-segmentation component extracts the tongue body image from an input photograph taken by a smartphone. The tongue-coating color classification component predicts the category of the coating color. The segmented image and diagnosis results are returned to the app and shown to the user. Experimental results show that Mask R-CNN is the optimal choice for tongue-image segmentation under various input image conditions based on the mean interaction over union value of 91% and the Dice score of 95%. ResNeXt outperformed other baseline tongue coating color classification models. In addition, when the input image is adjusted with our color-correction modules in advance, the classification accuracy of ResNeXt101 is improved by approximately 12%.

AB Rehabilitation training for patients with limb activity dysfunction and sub-healthy state has gradually shifted from therapies to strategies with remote assistance. Stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) are characterized by a structure that varies with task complexity, making them ideal for use as the lightweight AI activity recognition model in a remote rehabilitation training system. Given an imbalanced data classification and large-scale data analytics task, the original SCN classifiers may fail to provide satisfied performance. In this paper, we propose two solution that are Bagging SCNs and Boosting SCNs for HAR based on SCNs. Bagging SCNs use the bootstrap method to generate balanced subsets to reduce the influence caused by imbalance dataset. Then, multiple SCNs models are trained in parallel, followed by the identification of the best ensemble model through validation sets. Boosting SCNs employ forward stagewise additive modeling and utilize the SAMME algorithm to minimize the multi-class exponential loss for multi-class classification. This algorithm progressively enhances the base learner's focus on previously misclassified instances from previous rounds, ultimately lowering the misclassification rate. The activity datasets of three groups of tests are collected by using a self-built experimental platform. Our experiments compare the performance of two Ensemble SCNs with original SCNs, Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) and Support Vector Classifier. Results in the performance of two Ensemble SCNs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has good potential to be applied for HAR algorithm.

ID HANDWRITING EVIDENCE; IDENTIFICATION; COMPUTATION; STRENGTH; EVALUATE
AB Machine learning-based score likelihood ratios (SLRs) have emerged as alternatives to traditional likelihood ratios and Bayes factors to quantify the value of evidence when contrasting two opposing propositions. When developing a conventional statistical model is infeasible, machine learning can be used to construct a (dis)similarity score for complex data and estimate the ratio of the conditional distributions of the scores. Under the common source problem, the opposing propositions address if two items come from the same source. To develop their SLRs, practitioners create datasets using pairwise comparisons from a background population sample. These comparisons result in a complex dependence structure that violates the independence assumption made by many popular methods. We propose a resampling step to remedy this lack of independence and an ensemble approach to enhance the performance of SLR systems. First, we introduce a source-aware resampling plan to construct datasets where the independence assumption is met. Using these newly created sets, we train multiple base SLRs and aggregate their outputs into a final value of evidence. Our experimental results show that this ensemble SLR can outperform a traditional SLR approach in terms of the rate of misleading evidence and discriminatory power and present more consistent results.

ID VOLATILITY
AB Bitcoin (BTC) perpetual futures contracts are highly leveraged speculative trading instruments with daily market trading of $45 Billion. BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts, which depend upon the underlying BTC SPOT (current) price. Pricing perpetual futures fairly is hard, using traditional arbitrage arguments, because of the volatile nature of the so called funding rate, which is used as the replacement of risk free rate in the Cryptocurrency market. This work presents a novel technique for pricing BTC futures contracts using conditional volatility and mean models. Intra-day high-frequency futures' return volatility and mean are modelled using different ML and econometric techniques. A comparison is made using statistical measures to find the model that best captures the intra-day conditional mean and volatility. Exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is shown to be an almost unbiased predictor of intra-day volatility, while a constant autoregressive moving average (0, 0) model best captures the conditional mean of the returns. A market directional high frequency trading algorithm is developed using the volatility and mean models. The algorithm first prices the futures contract at some future point of time using the volatility and mean regression models. Next, the slope between the current futures price and the expected price are used to predict the market direction. A long or short position is taken depending upon the expected market direction movement. Extensive back-testing results show absolute returns of 1500%-8000% depending upon the transaction fees and leverage used. On average, the market direction is predicted correctly 85% of the time by the best model. Finally, the trading technique is market neutral, in that it gives large positive returns, with low SD, in both bull and bear markets.

ID RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHM; INTERNET
AB Here, a novel image-based quantized compressive sensing (QCS) framework based on complex-valued Vandermonde (Vander) matrix is proposed. In the proposed QCS framework, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) serves as a sparse basis and a partial complex-valued Vander matrix serves as a measurement matrix. The theoretical analysis based on mutual coherence metric of compressive sensing (CS) theory shows that the proposed Vander measurement matrix has the best reconstruction performance among other conventional measurement matrices. The simulation results also show that the recovery quality using the proposed measurement matrix can be greatly improved compared with the other existing real-valued measurement matrices. In particular, the experiment results also show that under the same measurement matrix, the reconstruction performance of Smoothed l(0) norm (SL0) algorithm is better than that of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm, sparsity adaptive matching pursuit (SAMP) algorithm and approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm. In addition, a sparse measurement matrix scheme is further proposed to achieve a trade-off between recovery performance and computational complexity. The theoretical analysis and simulation results both show the proposed image-based QCS is efficient.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the problem of functional outlier detection. Our method leverages a low-dimensional and stable representation of functions using Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We define a depth measure based on density kernels that satisfy desirable properties. We also address the challenges associated with estimating the density kernel depth. Throughout a Monte Carlo simulation we assess the performance of our functional depth measure in the outlier detection task under different scenarios. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we showcase the proposed method in action studying outliers in mortality rate curves.

AB Multi-attribute decision making is aimed at identifying the problem of ranking the finite alternatives or selecting the best alternatives within feasible alternatives. In this study, we investigate two new notions, namely q-rung orthopair multi-fuzzy set and q-rung orthopair multi-fuzzy soft set, which combine the benefits of both q-rung orthopair fuzzy set and multi-fuzzy soft set. The eminent characteristic of these two new notions is their ability to overcome the insufficiency of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy set and multi-fuzzy soft set. It is observed that the nature of the q-rung orthopair multi-fuzzy set and the q-rung orthopair multi-fuzzy soft set is more beneficial for expressing unclear and vague information. Some of their fundamental operations, namely complement, equality, subset, union and intersection operations, are defined. Next, the TOPSIS mechanism using the correlation coefficient has been presented to rank the best airlines to fly during the COVID-19 pandemic in a q-rung orthopair multi-fuzzy soft environment. Finally, a comparative analysis of the developed approach is given to ensure the supremacy of the proposed method in the existing literature.

AB Under the retailing environment, shelf space-based competition between items with different brands has drawn much attention from practitioners and researchers, the decision for low-temperature stored items on limited shelf spaces are compounding this challenge. This paper discusses the shelf display space partition assignment decision for low-temperature dairy items with two-phase demand in remaining shelf-life to maximize the profit of the shelf. Two-phase demand is assumed for the first time based on the knowledge that consumers' perception on the quality of the dairy item is unequal to its true shelf-life. Moreover, considering shelf partitions in different heights carry different sale gaining potentials, three profit weights are given to the partitions. Herein, a new research model named as SPSPA of shelf profit space partition assignment for the low-temperature stored dairy items is constructed. To effectively solve the proposed SPSPA, a hybrid firefly particle swarm optimization (HFPSO) is developed combing the superiority of particle swarm optimization (PSO) in coarse search and firefly algorithm (FA) in fine search. Numerical experiments have been performed on small- and large-scale cases to verify the performance of the proposed HFPSO algorithm by comparing with genetic algorithm, differential evolution (DE), PSO, and FA based on which management insights are obtained for the shelf space assignment decision.

AB This paper aims to present a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) technique where inputs of the decision-makers (DMs) have been collected using triangular Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (TPFNs) to capture the uncertainty of the real-world scenario better. The correlation consensus degree has been calculated to determine the weights of DMs. The correlation between a DM's judgment and collective judgment has been estimated to determine how much any individual judgment resembles the collective judgment. Accordingly, weights have been allocated to the DMs. Dombi aggregation operator (DAO), known for demonstrating good flexibility with the operational parameter, has been developed in the triangular Pythagorean fuzzy environment for information fusion. Furthermore, the properties of the newly introduced operator, namely the triangular Pythagorean fuzzy Dombi aggregation (TPFDA) operator, are described. To determine the criteria weights, preference and non-preference of one criterion over another are expressed in terms of the strength and weakness scores based on the advantage and disadvantage scores, respectively. An optimization model is developed for maximizing the overall satisfaction degree utilizing the strength and weakness scores. The methodology has been applied for the site selection problem for installing solar photovoltaic (PV) cells in India. Many analyses have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology developed.

ID SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB A novel online critical neural network weight adjustment algorithm is proposed in this paper by combining policy iteration and recursive least squares (RLSs) to address the problem of optimal control of players in nonlinear systems with nonzero-sum games. The interaction between players and the nonlinearity of the system make it difficult to solve the Hamiltonian function directly. From a linear regression perspective, this paper regards any admissible control and its corresponding value function as the input and output affected by perturbations. By using RLS to process the current data and store the historical data's covariance matrix to adjust the weights, the calculation is greatly simplified by avoiding the space waste caused by a lot of historical data storage and the time waste caused by data collection. When calculating the cumulative error, a discount factor is introduced to avoid the total error value tending to infinity and the effect of historical policy evaluation, where the covariance matrix tends to zero and loses its adjustment effect. When the error of the Hamiltonian equation is zero, the proposed adjustment law will also tend to zero. After that, the stability of the covariance matrix was analysed as well as the convergence of the weight errors was proved. Finally, two simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm based on the RLS method for solving the Nash equilibrium solution online.

DE Evidence retrieval; Question answering; Machine reading comprehension;

AB Evidence retrieval is a crucial step in question answering (QA) tasks, which can filter original context to provide supporting evidence for reading comprehension and reduce the time of answer inference. Most research interests in evidence retrieval have been paid to supervised methods, while unsupervised evidence retrieval received limited attention. However, most existing works for unsupervised evidence retrieval regard sentence-level and passage-level evidence retrieval as two independent processes. In order to fuse these two levels of information, we propose an efficient and unsupervised multi-grained evidence retrieval method for QA, which considers multiple interactions, including query-sentence, query-passage, and passage-passage. Specifically, we use sentence-level retrieval to obtain an evidence framework. Then we propose a score fusion mechanism to model the unilateral guiding relationship between sentence-level and passage-level retrieval. On the basis of score fusion, we propose a gated selection mechanism to retrieve evidence passages, which can supplement reasoning information for the evidence framework. Extensive experiments on open-domain and multi-hop QA datasets show that our method has fast retrieval speed while achieving better retrieval and QA performance than baselines.

AB To enhance the real-time performance and reduce CPU usage in feature-based visual SLAM, this paper introduces a lightweight tightly coupled stereo-inertial SLAM with fisheye cameras, incorporating several key innovations. First, the stereo-fisheye camera is treated as two independent monocular cameras, and the SE(3) transformation is computed between them to minimize the CPU burden during stereo feature matching and eliminate the need for camera rectification. Another important innovation is the application of maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation for the inertial measurement unit (IMU), which effectively reduces inertial bias and noise in a short time frame. By optimizing the system's parameters, the constant-velocity model is replaced from the beginning, resulting in improved tracking efficiency. Furthermore, the system incorporates the inertial data in the loop closure thread. The IMU data are employed to determine the translation direction relative to world coordinates and utilized as a necessary condition for loop detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior real-time performance and lower CPU usage compared to the majority of other SLAM systems.

AB Weighted nuclear norm provides a simple yet powerful tool to characterize the intrinsic low-rank structure of a matrix, and has been successfully applied to the matrix completion problem. However, in previous studies, the weighting functions to calculate the weights are fixed beforehand, and do not change during the whole iterative process. Such predefined weighting functions may not be able to precisely characterize the complicated structure underlying the observed data matrix, especially in the dynamic estimation process, and thus limits its performance. To address this issue, we propose a strategy of adaptive weighting function, for low-rank matrix/tensor completion. Specifically, we first parameterize the weighting function as a simple yet flexible neural network, that can approximate a wide range of monotonic decreasing functions. Then we propose an effective strategy, by virtue of the bi-level optimization technique, to adapt the weighting function, and incorporate this strategy to the alternating direction method of multipliers for solving low-rank matrix and tensor completion problems. Our empirical studies on a series of synthetic and real data have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach, as compared with representative low-rank matrix and tensor completion methods.

AB To protect the images and provide a more secure cipher image, DNA encoding is crucial in image encryption. Applying a single, easily detectable coding rule to the image during DNA encoding has no impact on the encryption model's security level. Therefore, using various coding rules while applying encryption to the image, dynamic DNA-coding techniques have emerged to strengthen and improve the encryption of the image and its security. This study integrates a dynamic DNA-coding method with an encryption model. The model is applied to gray-scale images, where using a predetermined coding rule, every two bits are DNA-encoded in the image. The proposed model generates the key by sending the image and its metadata to hash functions. Following that, the hyperchaotic system constructs three chaotic sequences using the key, and the Lorenz-Liu chaotic system generates a sequence of coding rules. Then, the image is passed to Arnold Transform, where the resulted image is diffused by applying five chaotic maps. Last, using the coding rules, it is DNA-encoded, provided with the chaotic sequences to DNA, and DNA-decoded. Twelve metrics were used to assess the proposed model on ten widely used images. Results show a promising improvement in performance, since it enhanced the security of the model.

AB The rapid advancement of technology such as stream processing technologies, deep-learning approaches, and artificial intelligence plays a prominent and vital role, to detect heart rate using a prediction model. However, the existing methods could not handle high -dimensional datasets, and deep feature learning to improvise the performance. Therefore, this work proposed a real-time heart rate prediction model, using K-nearest neighbour (KNN) adhered to the principle component analysis algorithm (PCA) and weighted random forest algorithm for feature fusion (KPCA-WRF) approach and deep CNN feature learning framework. The feature selection, from the fused features, was optimized by ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to enhance the selected fused features from deep CNN. The optimized features were reduced to low dimensions using the PCA algorithm. The significant straight heart rate features are plotted by capturing out nearest similar data point values using the algorithm. The fused features were then classified for aiding the training process. The weighted values are assigned to those tuned hyper parameters (feature matrix forms). The optimal path and continuity of the weighted feature representations are moved using the random forest algorithm, in K-fold validation iterations.

AB This paper studies synchronization problems for a kind of parameter mismatched fractional-order neural networks with leakage terms and multiple delays by utilizing a novel hybrid impulsive control mechanism. The hybrid controller combines time-triggered and event-triggered, and switching updates can be described by the behavior between positive auxiliary function and preset exponentially decreasing function. The impulsive controlled neural networks can be translated to the impulsive differential fractional-order systems by using fractional-order calculus and Laplace transform method. Some lemmas are derived for fractional-order inequality with time delays, which together with the hybrid controller are employed to establish some sufficient quasi-synchronization criteria. And the event-triggered mechanism is proved to have no Zeno behavior. Some numerical simulations are showed to illustrate the effectiveness of the results.

AB Mobility robots may soon be among us, triggering a need for safety regulation. Robot safety regulation, however, remains underexplored, with only a few articles analyzing what regulatory approaches could be feasible. This article offers an account of the available regulatory strategies and attempts to theorize the effects of simulation-based safety regulation. The article first discusses the distinctive features of mobility robots as regulatory targets and argues that emergent behavior constitutes the key regulatory concern in designing robot safety regulation regimes. In contrast to many accounts, the article posits that emergent behavior dynamics do not arise from robot autonomy, learning capability, or code unexplainability. Instead, they emerge from the complexity of robot technological constitutions coupled with near-infinite environmental variability and non-linear performance dynamics of the machine learning components. Second, the article reviews rules-based and performance-based regulation and argues that both will fail adequately constrain emergent robot behaviors. The article claims that controlling mobility robots requires a simulation-based regulatory approach. Simulation-based regulation is a novelty with significant theoretical and practical implications. The article argues that the approach signifies a radical break in regulatory forms of knowledge and temporalities. Simulations enact virtual futures to create a new regulatory knowledge type. Practically, the novel safety knowledge type may destabilize the existing conceptual space of safety politics and liability allocation patterns.

TI BamnetTL: Bidirectional Attention Memory Network with Transfer Learning
   for Question Answering Matching
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

DT Article
AB In KBQA (knowledge base question answering), questions are processed using NLP (natural language processing), and knowledge base technology is used to generate the corresponding answers. KBQA is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of NLP. Q & A (question and answer) matching is an important part of knowledge base QA (question answering), in which the correct answer is selected from candidate answers. At present, Q & A matching task faces the problem of lacking training data in new fields, which leads to poor performance and low efficiency of the question answering system. The paper puts forward a KBQA Q & A matching model for deep feature transfer based on a bidirectional attention memory network, BamnetTL. It uses biattention to collect information from the knowledge base and question sentences in both directions in order to improve the accuracy of Q & A matching and transfers knowledge from different fields through a deep dynamic adaptation network. BamnetTL improves the accuracy of Q & A matching in the target domain by transferring the knowledge in the source domain with more training resources to the target domain with fewer training resources. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.

AB Signature verification requires high reliability. Especially in the writer-independent scenario with the skilledforgery-only condition, achieving high reliability is challenging but very important. In this paper, we propose to apply two machine learning frameworks, learning with rejection and top-rank learning, to this task because they can suppress ambiguous results and thus give only reliable verification results. Since those frameworks accept a single input, we transform a pair of genuine and query signatures into a single feature vector, called Paired Contrastive Feature (PCF). PCF internally represents similarity (or discrepancy) between the two paired signatures; thus, reliable machine learning frameworks can make reliable decisions using PCF. Through experiments on three public signature datasets in the offline skilled-forgery-only writer-independent scenario, we evaluate and validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed models by comparing their performance with a state-of-the-art model.

AB This paper investigates the use of Valid Inequalities (VIs) and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) neural networks in addressing the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem within the context of mission planning. The ONTS problem focuses on optimizing task scheduling while adhering to energy constraints and maximizing mission objectives. We propose a methodology that incorporates VIs to enhance the solution process and embeds a ReLU proxy model within a standard Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) framework to accu-rately predict photovoltaic (PV) power generation, aiding the scheduling process in maintaining the Maximum Power Point (MPP). In the MILP, the neural network weight vector is employed as a constant input, and an iterative technique refines the constraints. We introduce the P-split formulation to balance computational simplicity and the strength of the disjunctive constraint relaxation. The k-means algorithm identifies clusters for disjunctive constraints representing subsets of the decision space, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization is conducted using Optuna. Our computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VI methodologies in streamlining the problem-solving process, resulting in a significant speed improvement of 110 times faster on average when solving literature ONTS problem instances. Moreover, when applied to real-world nanosatellite mission planning instances, the proposed methodologies reveal the advantages of using our Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach over a constant voltage method, capturing more energy, extending task operation duration, and increasing objective values.

AB Deep learning based 3D point cloud classification and segmentation has achieved remarkable success. Existing methods are usually implemented in the original space with 3D coordinates as inputs. However, we find that point networks taking only information of first-order coordinates hardly learn geometric features of higher order, such as point cloud normals or poses. In this study, we propose to map the input point clouds into a non-linear space to facilitate networks learning and leveraging high-order features. Firstly, we design the Parametric Veronese Mapping (PVM) function which automatically learns to map point clouds into a non-linear space. As a result, the mapped point clouds are enriched with high-order elements and maintain the basic point set properties as in the original 3D space. We can then exploit existing networks to learn high-order features from mapped point clouds. Secondly, we contribute a two-stage transformation learning module that modifies the previous one-stage module to better leverage high-order features for aligning point clouds in the projective space. Finally, an interaction module is designed to learn more discriminative features by aggregating information from both the original and projective space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method successfully improves the ability of most existing networks to learn high-order features and thus contributing to more accurate classification and segmentation. Moreover, the resulting models show stronger robustness to affine transformations and real-world perturbations.

AB Internet giants collects a huge volume of data using the modern technologies and apply them to data mining for prediction and decision making in numerous fields, for instance, health care, web analysis, insurance, market basket analysis and bioinformatics. However, the huge repositories collects variety of data, it inevitably gathers a mass of private and sensitive data about the users. The revelation of such private and sensitive information may harm the user's privacy. In recent years, privacy is becoming an increasingly main concern in many data mining applications. Privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) has been evolved as the solution for the privacy issues. PPDM deals with protecting the individual's data without compromising the data utility. In this paper, privacy-chain based homomorphic encryption scheme along with the statistical transformation method weight of evi-dence and information value is proposed to preserve the private and sensitive information about the user. The proposed statistical transformation with homomorphic encryption (STHE) algorithm will perturb both the nu-merical and categorical values from the adult income, bank marketing and lung cancer datasets without affecting the data utility. In STHE, the quasi-identifiers are initially perturbed with IV and then privacy-chain based ho-momorphic encryption using RSA is applied to preserve the data privacy. The performance of the STHE algorithm is made compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms using the classifier models, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boost, and support vector machines. The experimental results shows that the proposed STHE algorithm outperforms the existing techniques in terms of accuracy, performance, data transformation, data retrieval and privacy preservation level along with the data utility.

AB In this paper, multi-objective allocation of photovoltaic (PV) energy resources (MO-APVER) in unbalanced 33 -bus distribution network is performed widely with objective of minimizing energy losses, improving reliability and reducing the unbalanced voltage considering the variable load for a 24-hour period. The problem is defined as a multi-objective optimization model based on the fuzzy decision-making method (FDMM) and decision variables include the location and size of PV sources as well as the network phase number for single-phase PV distribution, which is optimally, determined using multi-objective improved manta ray foraging optimization (MOIMRFO) algorithm. The conventional MRFO is inspired with hunting behavior of the manta ray and its performance is improved in local and global exploration using an inertia weight decreasing strategy. The sim-ulations are performed in different cases of distributing the single-phase PVs on different phases of the network as constant phase, unplanned and optimal. The results show that the non-optimal and unplanned distribution of the PVs in the network phases has increased the voltage unbalance although reduced the energy losses and slightly improved the reliability, while the optimal case based on the MOIMRFO has significantly reduced the voltage unbalance in addition to reducing the energy losses and improving the reliability. Also, the MO-APVER compared to the single-objective (SO) has achieved a compromise between different objectives without any violation. Moreover, the superiority of the proposed optimization algorithm is confirmed in SO-and MO-APVER in achieving to the better values of the objectives in comparison with the conventional multi-objective MRFO, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithms.

AB Bird song recognition plays an important function in ecosystem balance monitoring, biodiversity detection, and biodiversity conservation. Due to the complexity of the natural environment, based on deep learning, there is a problem of information loss in extracting audio features with a single filter. Identifying bird sounds efficiently and quickly is still a challenge. To address this problem, a lightweight multi-sensory field dual-feature fusion residual network (LDFSRE-NET) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, using the feature extraction filters based on Mel and SincNet to extract birdsong's low -frequency and timbre information. The proposed dual-feature fusion module (FFMS) is used to fuse the low-frequency and timbre information with the differences between the two feature sets. Secondly, the double-layer residual module (DBNet), connected by basicblock and downblock, is used as the backbone network for bird song recognition to improve the training speed. To improve the different perceptual fields of the backbone network, the 3 x 3 convolutional modules in the basicblocks of the two residual modules are replaced with a Diverse Branch Block. They make the network performs better on recognition tasks under complex situations of multiple branches. Then, the ShuffleAttention attention module is embedded between the two layers of the residual module for transferring its valid information, enhancing the spectrogram ripple feature, and further improving the network's recognition performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on three datasets: the self-built 30-class bird song dataset (Birdselfdata), the public datasets Birdsdata and Urbansound8K. The model proposed in this paper surpasses the state-of-the-art sound recognition model methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The recognition accuracy on these three datasets of this model are 96.75%, 96.46%, and 97.98%, with the F1-score of 96.79%, 96.39%, and 97.88%. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the development of social platforms, the social network has aroused wide attention. Since social networks contain a lot of personal sensitive information, many privacy preservation methods have been designed for social networks to allay concerns about privacy disclosure of people. However, most of the existing methods disturb the social networks too much to ensure the utility of social networks. To this end, we propose a negative survey based privacy preservation method, called NetNS, to preserve the topology privacy of social networks, where a dedicated negative survey model is developed to disturb edges in social networks in order to preserve the topology privacy of them. The theoretical analysis indicates that the developed NetNS is efficient, and can resist two common graph structure attacks including friendship attack and subgraph attack, while empirical studies conducted on three real-world social networks show that compared to six existing privacy preservation algorithms tailored for the topology of social networks, the developed NetNS can provide disturbed social networks with better utility while achieving same privacy preservation level. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Deep learning algorithms have the potential to automate the examination of medical images ob-tained in clinical practice. Using digitized medical images, convolution neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated their ability and promise to discriminate among different image classes. As an initial step towards explainability in clinical diagnosis, deep learning models must be exceedingly precise, offering a measure of uncertainty for their predictions. Such uncertainty-aware models can help medical professionals in detecting complicated and corrupted samples for re-annotation or exclusion. This paper proposes a new model and data-agnostic mechanism, called Actionable Uncertainty Quantification Optimization (AUQantO) to improve the performance of deep learning architectures for medical image classification. This is achieved by optimizing the hyperparameters of the proposed entropy-based and Monte Carlo (MC) dropout uncertainty quantification techniques escorted by single -and multi-objective optimization methods, abstaining from the classification of images with a high level of uncertainty. This helps in improving the overall accuracy and reliability of deep learning models. To support the above claim, AUQantO has been validated with four deep learning architectures on four medical image datasets and using various performance metric measures such as precision, recall, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve score (AUC), and accuracy. The study demonstrated notable enhancements in deep learning performance, with average accuracy improvements of 1.76% and 2.02% for breast cancer histology and 5.67% and 4.24% for skin cancer datasets, utilizing two uncertainty quantification techniques, and AUQantO further improved accuracy by 1.41% and 1.31% for brain tumor and 4.73% and 1.83% for chest cancer datasets while allowing exclusion of images based on confidence levels.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORK; FREQUENCY
AB For acoustic event recognition (AER), it is important to extract the semantic feature that considers both the content information and the temporal ordering. To this end, our previous work proposed a common subspace learning (CSL) based method. However, the CSL treats the subspace learning and the back-end classifier training as two separate phases. In this manner, the discriminative information of the latter phase cannot be utilized to supervise the former learning. Therefore, the extracted feature based on the learned subspace also cannot contain the discriminative information. To solve this problem, we further propose a task-driven CSL (TD-CSL) based method to extract the semantic feature by jointly learning the above two phases. In the TD-CSL, the discriminative information, obtained during the classifier training phase, can be effectively adopted to supervise the learning of the common subspace. Specifically, the TD-CSL is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, which regards the objective for the CSL in the lower level as a constraint of that for the classifier training in the upper. Furthermore, to obtain the optimal solutions of the subspace and the classifier, a gradient-based algorithm is designed. To evaluate the performance of the TD-CSL, experiments are conducted on the ESC-50 and ESC-10 databases. The TD-CSL can achieve 85.75% and 98.75% recognition accuracies on the two databases respectively, which outperforms the CSL and the related state-of-the-art methods.

AB Efficient communication is significant for federated learning and DNN model deployment. However, transferring hundreds of millions of DNN parameters over networks with limited bandwidth results in long communication delays or even data losses. To alleviate or even remove the communication bottleneck, efficient methods for parameter compression can be applied. Inspired by video encoding, which exploits inter-frame similarity for compression, we investigate the strong temporal correlations of parameter updates in two near epochs of the DNN model and introduce a model parameter residual encoding framework. By transmitting encoded residual between model parameters in two near epochs, the receiver can reconstruct new model parameters and finish the updates with less communication cost. Furthermore, with respect to our framework, we develop lossless and lossy model parameter compression methods and demonstrate them on popular classification and detection networks. The results show that the lossless method can compress the data size of the parameters to less than 90%, and the lossy method can shrink the parameter size to less than 50% with a fair low loss.

AB Introduction: Biomarkers of mental effort may help to identify subtle cognitive impairments in the absence of task performance deficits. Here, we aim to detect mental effort on a verbal task, using automated voice analysis and machine learning.
   Methods: Audio data from the digit span backwards task were recorded and scored with automated speech recognition using the online platform NeuroVocalix (TM), yielding usable data from 2,764 healthy adults (1,022 male, 1,742 female; mean age 31.4 years). Acoustic features were aggregated across each trial and normalized within each subject. Cognitive load was dichotomized for each trial by categorizing trials at >0.6 of each participants' maximum span as "high load." Data were divided into training (60%), test (20%), and validate (20%) datasets, each containing different participants. Training and test data were used in model building and hyper-parameter tuning. Five classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were trained to predict cognitive load ("high" vs. "low") based on acoustic features. Analyses were limited to correct responses. The model was evaluated using the validation dataset, across all span lengths and within the subset of trials with a four-digit span. Classifier discriminant power was examined with Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis.
   Results: Participants reached a mean span of 6.34 out of 8 items (SD = 1.38). The Gradient Boosting classifier provided the best performing model on test data (AUC = 0.98) and showed excellent discriminant power for cognitive load on the validation dataset, across all span lengths (AUC = 0.99), and for four-digit only utterances (AUC = 0.95).
   Discussion: A sensitive biomarker of mental effort can be derived from vocal acoustic features in remotely administered verbal cognitive tests. The use-case of this biomarker for improving sensitivity of cognitive tests to subtle pathology now needs to be examined.

AB While the continuing decline in genotyping and sequencing costs has largely benefited plant research, some key species for meeting the challenges of agriculture remain mostly understudied. As a result, heterogeneous datasets for different traits are available for a significant number of these species. As gene structures and functions are to some extent conserved through evolution, comparative genomics can be used to transfer available knowledge from one species to another. However, such a translational research approach is complex due to the multiplicity of data sources and the non-harmonized description of the data. Here, we provide two pipelines, referred to as structural and functional pipelines, to create a framework for a NoSQL graph-database (Neo4j) to integrate and query heterogeneous data from multiple species. We call this framework Orthology-driven knowledge base framework for translational research (Ortho_KB). The structural pipeline builds bridges across species based on orthology. The functional pipeline integrates biological information, including QTL, and RNA-sequencing datasets, and uses the backbone from the structural pipeline to connect orthologs in the database. Queries can be written using the Neo4j Cypher language and can, for instance, lead to identify genes controlling a common trait across species. To explore the possibilities offered by such a framework, we populated Ortho_KB to obtain OrthoLegKB, an instance dedicated to legumes. The proposed model was evaluated by studying the conservation of a flowering-promoting gene. Through a series of queries, we have demonstrated that our knowledge graph base provides an intuitive and powerful platform to support research and development programmes.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Hate speech detection; Deep learning; Semi-supervised learning
AB Anti-Asian speech during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a serious problem with severe consequences. A hate speech wave swept social media platforms. The timely detection of Anti-Asian COVID-19-related hate speech is of utmost importance, not only to allow the application of preventive mechanisms but also to anticipate and possibly prevent other similar discriminatory situations. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting Anti-Asian COVID-19-related hate speech from social media data. Previous approaches that tackled this problem used a transformer-based model, BERT/RoBERTa, trained on the homologous annotated dataset and achieved good performance on this task. However, this requires extensive and annotated datasets with a strong connection to the topic. Both goals are difficult to meet without employing reliable, vast, and costly resources. In this paper, we propose a robust semi-supervised model, SSL-GAN-RoBERTa, that learns from a limited heterogeneous dataset and whose performance is further enhanced by using vast amounts of unlabeled data from another related domain. Compared with the RoBERTa baseline model, the experimental results show that the model has substantial performance gains in terms of Accuracy and Macro-F1 score in different scenarios that use data from different domains. Our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance results while efficiently using unlabeled data, showing promising applicability to other complex classification tasks where large amounts of labeled examples are difficult to obtain.

We develop an effective optimal adaptive particle swarm optimization-triangular neural network (PSO-TNN), which consists of three parts: particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) improved trigonometric function, extreme learning machine algorithm with initial conditions (IELM) and improved reduction algorithm. The results obtained that PSO-TNN is superior to triangular neural network (TNN) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and PSO is superior to Aquila Optimizer (AO), Smell Agent Optimization (SAO), African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA), Arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) in the optimization of neural network. Because the relationship between the number of neural networks and the mean square error is uncertain, we propose the adaptive reduction algorithm (AR). Through the comparison of numerical solutions with the analytical solutions and traditional numerical solutions, the PSO-TNN algorithm clearly reduced the mean square error and relative error. The PSO-TNN algorithm shows a clear improvement in terms of accuracy and overall efficiency.

AB Motivated by a leading Chinese multinational manufacturer's practical air cargo logistics activities, we investigate an air cargo partitioning problem with a piecewise linear cost function (ACPP-PLC). In this problem, the charging policy chooses the higher value between the actual weight and the volumetric weight of the cargo as the chargeable weight, where the volumetric weight is calculated from the cargo's volume according to a particular conversion factor. The variable transportation cost is then computed using a piecewise linear cost function of the chargeable weight. We formulate the ACPP-PLC as a mixed-integer linear programming model and propose a tailored adaptive large neighborhood search (TALNS) algorithm, combining the adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm and the tabu search heuristic in a single framework. Numerical experiments show that the proposed TALNS can generate high-quality solutions for all the instances in a much shorter time than the off-the-shelf solver CPLEX. Additional experiments are also conducted to analyze the effects of critical ingredients of the TALNS algorithm.

AB This paper presents an effective approach for solving economic load dispatch problems contemplating the scheduling a set of thermal generating units to produce a specific power at low consumption costs. These problems can be thought of as nonlinear, non-convex, and highly constrained optimization problems with a large number of local minima. To cope with the above issues in solving such problems, a new meta-heuristic named capuchin search algorithm was adopted. To boost the search performance of this algorithm as well as to mitigate its early convergence and regression to the local optimum, it was hybridized with another algorithm and improved using several positive amendments. First, a memory element was added to this algorithm to ameliorate its position and velocity update mechanisms in order to exploit the most encouraging candidate solutions. Second, two adaptive parametric functions were used to manage the exploration and exploitation features of this algorithm and balance them appropriately. Finally, the hybridization was made using the gradient-based optimizer to strengthen the intensification ability of this algorithm and balance its searching ability to fulfill sensible search performance. The proficiency of the proposed algorithm was divulged by assessing it on computationally difficult economic load dispatch problems under 6 different tests with a generator of 3, 13, 40, 80, and 140 units, each with different constraints and load conditions. The proposed algorithm provided the best performance among many other competitors. Its superiority and practicality were revealed by obtaining optimal solutions for large-scale test cases such as 40-unit and 140-unit test systems.

AB This paper describes a randomized algorithm for computing mixed Nash equilibrium (NE) in bimatrix games. The new algorithm transforms the NE problem of bimatrix games into a new form by using a fuzzification technique, it calculates mixed NE points in the new bimatrix games. This paper proves that the solution of the new bimatrix games is also a solution of the original bimatrix games. It proves that the computational complexity of the new algorithm for computing mixed NE points in bimatrix games is in the class of randomized polynomial time (RP). Examples are given that show the new algorithm can find two times more mixed NE points than Lemke-Howson algorithm. Numerical experiments indicate that the average computational time of the new algorithm is four hundred time faster than Lemke-Howson algorithm for calculating the first mixed NE point.

ID BREAST-CANCER; RISK-FACTORS
AB Transcription activating factor 3 (STAT3) is a cytokine involved in signal transduction in the STAT transcription factor family, which exists in the cytoplasm. It plays an important role in the process of signal transduction from cell surface receptor to nucleus after receiving extracellular environment information. STAT3 is strictly regulated in normal cells. Overactivation of this cytokine will lead to the generation of cancer and the proliferation of cancer cells, promote cancer cells to metastasize through blood vessels, and inhibit apoptosis. STAT3 is also involved in the inhibition of antitumor immune response and other carcinogenic processes. In this paper, erythropolonine A is used as the precursor to synthesize STAT3 inhibitor to study whether the inhibitor has the efficacy of treating tumors. First, this paper screened erythropolonine A, the STAT3 inhibitor, through computer-aided virtual screening, and further evaluated its mechanism of action on the platform of DU145 cell line. Then, compound ST-073 was used to detect whether it affected the expression of downstream apoptosis inhibitor gene (survivin) and G1/S-specific cyclin-D1 (cyclin D1). We found that compound ST-073 can promote the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells by inhibiting the concentration-dependent expression of survivin gene, but has no significant effect on cyclin D1, which proves that STAT3 inhibitor has the effect of treating tumors. Therefore, the rhodioline A screened by the computer can be used as a precursor for the biosynthesis of STAT3 inhibitors. Experiments show that STAT3 inhibitors have significant tumor therapeutic effects.

ID REGRESSION
AB This article studies the performance monitoring problem for the potassium chloride flotation process, which is a critical component of potassium fertilizer processing. To address its froth image segmentation problem, this article proposes a multiscale feature extraction and fusion network (MsFEFNet) to overcome the multiscale and weak edge characteristics of potassium chloride flotation froth images. MsFEFNet performs simultaneous feature extraction at multiple image scales and automatically learns spatial information of interest at each scale to achieve efficient multiscale information fusion. In addition, the potassium chloride flotation process is a multistage dynamic process with massive unlabeled data. To overcome its dynamic time-varying and working condition spatial similarity characteristics, a semi-supervised froth-grade prediction model based on a temporal-spatial neighborhood learning network combined with Mean Teacher (MT-TSNLNet) is proposed. MT-TSNLNet designs a new objective function for learning the temporal-spatial neighborhood structure of data. The introduction of Mean Teacher can further utilize unlabeled data to promote the proposed prediction model to better track the concentrate grade. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed MsFEFNet and MT-TSNLNet, froth image segmentation and grade prediction experiments are performed on a real-world potassium chloride flotation process dataset.

AB This article deals with the distributed proportional-integral state estimation problem for nonlinear systems over sensor networks (SNs), where a number of spatially distributed sensor nodes are utilized to collect the system information. The signal transmissions among different sensor nodes are realized via their individual channels subject to energy-constrained Denial-of-Service (EC-DoS) cyber-attacks launched by the adversaries whose aim is to block the nodewise communications. Such EC-DoS attacks are characterized by a sequence of attack starting time-instants and a sequence of attack durations. Based on the measurement outputs of each node, a novel distributed fuzzy proportional-integral estimator is proposed that reflects the topological information of the SNs. The estimation error dynamics is shown to be regulated by a switching system under certain assumptions on the frequency and the duration of the EC-DoS attacks. Then, by resorting to the average dwell-time method, a unified framework is established to analyze the dynamical behaviors of the resultant estimation error system, and sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the stability as well as the weighted H-8 performance of the estimation error dynamics. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed estimation scheme.

ID POINTING GESTURES
AB This work provides the fundament for a gesture-based interaction system between cargo-handling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground personnel. It enables novice operators to visually communicate commands with higher abstractions through a minimum number of necessary gestures. The interaction concept intends to transfer two goal-directed control techniques to a cargo-handling use case: Selecting objects via deictic pointing communicates intention and a single proxy manipulation gesture controls the UAV's flight. A visual processing pipeline built around an RGB-D sensor is presented and its subordinate components like lightweight object detectors and human pose estimation methods are benchmarked on the UAV-Human dataset. The results provide an overview of suitable methods for 3D gesture-based human drone interaction. A first unoptimized model ensemble runs with 7Hz on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit.

TI Reducing Mode Collapse With Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Transport for

DT Article; Early Access
DE Generative adversarial network (GAN); mode collapse; Monge problem;
   optimal transport (OT) map
AB Mode collapse has been a persisting challenge in generative adversarial networks (GANs), and it directly affects the applications of GAN in many domains. Existing works that attempt to solve this problem have some serious limitations: models using optimal transport (OT) strategies (e.g., Wasserstein distance) lead to vanishing or exploding gradients; increasing the number of generators can cause several generators focusing on the same mode; and approaches that modify the loss also do not satisfactorily resolve mode collapse. In this article, we reduce mode collapse by formulating it as a Monge problem of OT map. We show that the Monge problem can be transformed to the distribution transformation problem in GAN, and a rectified affine neural network can be considered as a measurable function. In this way, we propose Monge GAN that uses this measurable function to transform the generated data distribution into the original data distribution. We utilize the Kantorovich formulation to obtain the OT cost, which is regarded as the OT distance between the two distributions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both image and numerical datasets to validate our Monge GAN in reducing model collapse.

AB The study, simulation, and implementation of neural behavior in the human brain are central goals of neuromorphic engineering. By integrating various scientific fields, we present a hardware solution based on neuronal cell mechanisms that can emulate such a nature-inspired system. This article presents a Fitz-Hugh Nagumo (FHN) neuron implemented using COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer (CORDIC), which accurately reproduces various patterns of the original FHN neuron model. We propose a modification to the original nonlinear term using a CORDIC IP-Core, resulting in high matching accuracy and low computational error. The proposed model is validated through time domain and dynamic analysis, which demonstrates its high accuracy and low error in reproducing all features of the FHN model. For large scale neuron implementations, we present an efficient digital hardware solution based on the resource sharing techniques. The hardware is implemented on Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) using Hardware Description Language (HDL), as a proof of concept. The results from the hardware implementation show that the proposed model uses only 1% of the resources available on a Virtex 4 FPGA board. Additionally, the static timing analysis shows that the circuit can operate at a maximum frequency of 320 MHz.

AB The possibility for one to recover the parameters-weights and biases-of a neural network thanks to the knowledge of its function on a subset of the input space can be, depending on the situation, a curse or a blessing. On one hand, recovering the parameters allows for better adversarial attacks and could also disclose sensitive information from the dataset used to construct the network. On the other hand, if the parameters of a network can be recovered, it guarantees the user that the features in the latent spaces can be interpreted. It also provides foundations to obtain formal guarantees on the performances of the network. It is therefore important to characterize the networks whose parameters can be identified and those whose parameters cannot. In this article, we provide a set of conditions on a deep fully-connected feedforward ReLU neural network under which the parameters of the network are uniquely identified-modulo permutation and positive rescaling-from the function it implements on a subset of the input space.

ID SYSTEMS
AB An event-based social network is a new type of social network that combines online and offline networks, and one of its important problems is recommending suitable activities to users. However, the current research seldom considers balancing the accuracy, diversity and fairness of group activity recommendations. To solve this problem, we propose a group activity recommendation approach that considers fairness and diversity perception. Firstly, we calculate activity similarity based on the context and construct an activity similarity graph. We define the weighted coverage on the similarity graph as a submodular function and transform the problem of fair and diverse group activity recommendation into maximizing the weighted coverage on the similarity graph while considering accuracy, fairness, and diversity. Secondly, we employ a greedy algorithm to find an approximate solution that maximizes the weighted coverage with an approximation ratio. Finally, we conducted experiments on two real datasets and demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing approaches. Specifically, in the domain of diversity-based recommendation algorithms, our method achieves a remarkable 0.02% increase in recall rate. Furthermore, in the domain of fairness-based recommendation algorithms, our proposed method outperforms the latest approach by 0.05% in terms of overall metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of our method in achieving a better balance among accuracy, fairness, and diversity.

AB Ascertaining the precise detection of traffic objects, drivable areas, and lane lines is the foremost obligation for an automatic driving system. The efficient execution of these tasks is made arduous by the intricate and dynamic nature of the driving environment, as well as varying lighting conditions. This paper proposes EHSINet, an efficient and versatile neural network architecture that adaptively addresses multiple tasks, including traffic object detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. ESHINet is based on the fully convolutional network, enabling the long-range and high-order spatial interactions between neighborhood features without using vision transformers. The performance of EHSINet is evaluated on the BDD100K and KITTI datasets, where it demonstrates superior performance, especially in complex environments, illumination changes, and severe weather conditions. EHSINet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets. The test results in real-world scenarios also demonstrate its strong generalization and practical value. Code is available at .

DT Article
DE computer vision; image processing
AB One of the most challenging topics in artificial intelligence is image-to-image translation, the purpose of which is generating images close to those in the target domain while preserving the important features of the images in the source domain. In this direction, various types of generative adversarial networks have been developed. ARDA-UNIT, presented in this paper, seeks to meet the main challenges of these networks, that is, producing a high-quality image in a reasonable amount of time, and transferring content between two images with different structures. The proposed recurrent dense self-attention block, applied in ARDA-UNIT's generator latent space, simultaneously increases its generating capability and decreases the training parameters. ARDA-UNIT has a feature extraction module which feeds both the generator and the discriminator. This module uses a new adaptive feature fusion method which combines multi-scale features in such a way that the characteristics of each scale are preserved. The module also uses a pre-trained CNN that reduces the training parameters. Moreover, a feature similarity loss is introduced that guides the model to change the structure of the source domain in accordance with that in the target domain. Experiments performed on different datasets using FID, KID and IS evaluation criteria have shown that the model reduces computational loads, transfers structures well, and achieves better qualities.

ID IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION; NETWORK; DARK
AB Blind super-resolution (SR) usually involves two sub-problems: (1) estimating the degradation of the given low-resolution (LR) image; (2) super-resolving the LR image to its high-resolution (HR) counterpart. Both problems are ill-posed due to the information loss in the degrading process. Most previous methods try to solve the two problems independently, but often fall into a dilemma: a good super-resolved HR result requires an accurate degradation estimation, which however, is difficult to be obtained without the help of original HR information. To address this issue, instead of considering these two problems independently, we adopt an alternating optimization algorithm, which can estimate the degradation and restore the SR image in a single model. Specifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely Restorer and Estimator. Restorer restores the SR image based on the estimated degradation, and Estimator estimates the degradation with the help of the restored SR image. We alternate these two modules repeatedly and unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In this way, both Restorer and Estimator could get benefited from the intermediate results of each other, and make each sub-problem easier. Moreover, Restorer and Estimator are optimized in an end-to-end manner, thus they could get more tolerant of the estimation deviations of each other and cooperate better to achieve more robust and accurate final results. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world images show that the proposed method can largely outperform state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results.

AB In this study, the performance of machine learning methods was examined in terms of predicting the science education achievement scores of the students who took the exam for the next term, PISA 2018, and the science average scores of the countries, using PISA 2015 data. The research sample consists of a total of 67,329 students who took the PISA 2015 exam from 13 randomly selected countries (Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Peru, Singapore, Turkiye). In this study, multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms were used. For the machine learning process, a randomly determined part from the PISA-2015 data of each country researched was divided as training data and the remaining part as testing data to evaluate model performance. As a result of the research, it was determined that the XGBoost algorithm showed the best performance in estimating both PISA-2015 test data and PISA-2018 science academic achievement scores in all researched countries. Furthermore, it was determined that the highest PISA-2018 science achievement scores of the students who participated in the exam, estimated by this algorithm, were in Luxembourg (r = 0.600, RMSE = 75.06, MAE = 59.97), while the lowest were in Finland (r = 0.467, RMSE = 79.38, MAE = 63.24). In addition, the average PISA-2018 science scores of the countries were estimated with the XGBoost algorithm, and the average science scores calculated for all the countries studied were estimated with very high accuracy.

AB Before languages came into existence, sign language was the mode of communication. For human-computer interaction, recognizing these sign languages is vital; thus, hand gesture recognition comes into play. With the advancement of technology and its vast applications, hand gesture recognition has become a common field of research. Gesture recognition has gained a lot of popularity due to its application in sign language detection for speech and hearing-impaired people. This paper presents a methodology for hand gesture recognition using a 3D convolutional neural network. The dataset used for this purpose is MINDS-Libras, a Brazilian sign language dataset. We propose a novel error correction-based key frame extraction technique that selects significant key frames for video summarization. The chosen key frames are preprocessed through the steps of the region of interest selection, background removal, segmentation, binarization, and resizing. The frames are given as input to the proposed three-dimensional convolutional neural network for the classification of hand gestures, which offers an accuracy of 98% and performs better than state-of-the-art techniques.

AB The exponential growth of social networks has given rise to a wide variety of content. Some social content violates the integrity and dignity of users, therefore, this task has become challenging. The need to deal with short texts, poorly written language, unbalanced classes, and non-thematic aspects. These can lead to overfitting in deep neural network (DNN) models used for classification tasks. Empirical evidence in previous studies indicates that some of these problems can be overcome by improving the optimization process of the DNN weights to avoid overfitting. Moreover, a well-defined learning process in the input examples could improve the order of the patterns learned throughout the optimization process. In this paper, we propose four Curriculum Learning strategies and a new Hybrid Genetic-Gradient Algorithm that proved to improve the performance of DNN models detecting the class of interest even in highly imbalanced datasets.

AB Traffic flow forecasting technology plays an important role in intelligent transportation systems. Based on graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, most previous works utilize the transformer architecture to discover spatiotemporal dependencies and dynamic relationships. However, they have not thoroughly considered correlation information among spatiotemporal sequences. In this paper, based on the maximal information coefficient, we present two elaborate spatiotemporal representations, spatial correlation information (SCorr) and temporal correlation information (TCorr). Using SCorr, we propose a correlation information-based spatiotemporal network (CorrSTN) that includes a dynamic graph neural network component for integrating correlation information into spatial structure effectively and a multi-head attention component for modeling dynamic temporal dependencies accurately. Utilizing TCorr, we explore the correlation pattern among different periodic data to identify the most relevant data, and then design an efficient data selection scheme to further enhance model performance. The experimental results on the highway traffic flow (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07 and PEMS08) and metro crowd flow (HZME inflow and outflow) datasets demonstrate that CorrSTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance. In particular, on the HZME (outflow) dataset, our model makes significant improvements compared with the ASTGNN model by 13.2%, 15.3% and 29.3% in the metrics of MAE, RMSE and MAPE, respectively.

AB The classical influence maximization (IM) in social network analysis aims at selecting a group of influential nodes as seed so that the number of nodes activated by the set is maximized when the spreading process completes. The single stage seeding problem would ignite all the seeds at the very beginning of the diffusion and let the influence diffuses passively with no additional supervision. However, the effect of scheduled seeding activation operations on improving the marginal profit tends to be ignored. More importantly, the practical scenarios that need external seeding activities can not be well depicted. In this paper, seed activation strategies are investigated for the adaptive influence maximization (AIM) problem under general feedback models. A novel bio-inspired meta-heuristic policy named discrete scheduled particle swarm optimization (DSPSO) is proposed to tackle the intractable problem confronted by AIM, i.e., which nodes need to be ignited at the right time during the process of influence spreading? Following the framework, the proposed policy selects optimal size of nodes into the seed set in each round to ensure the continuation of the spreading process. Dynamic encoding mechanism for the particle individuals is constructed. To make a full exploration of the solution space, a local search strategy specifically for the discrete network topology is implemented on the historical best individuals of the swarm. Extensive experiments on four social networks under different activation feedback models demonstrate the advantage of the scheduled seeding mechanism over the single stage seeding approaches, and show that the proposed DSPSO outperforms the existing greedy strategy as well as the topological heuristics.

AB Object-level landmarks enable the SLAM system to construct robust object-keyframe constraints of bundle adjustment and improve the pose estimation performance. In this paper, we present a real-time online object-level SLAM. The dual Bundle Adjustment (BA) optimization method, including high and low frequencies, is proposed to optimize the estimated pose. The High-frequency BA (HBA) module is used to quickly estimate the camera pose by matching landmarks of keyframes and feature points of the current frame. Then, the estimated camera pose is used in the Low-frequency BA (LBA) module to improve the trajectory accuracy. The LBA module integrates the object-level landmarks into the pose graph to optimize the camera pose of local mapping. Moreover, we build an additional object detection thread to extract object 2D bounding boxes online. While this paper improves the data association through the depth projection of point-line features and the Euclidean distance of object centroid. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm effectively reduce the drift error of camera pose estimation and improve the accuracy by a large margin on different datasets.

AB High-utility itemset mining (HUIM) is an effective technique for discovering significant information in data. However, data containing sensitive and private information may cause privacy concerns. Therefore, privacy preserving utility mining (PPUM) has recently become a critical research area. PPUM is the process of transforming a quantitative transactional database into a sanitised one, thus ensuring that utility mining algorithms cannot discover sensitive information. The sanitisation process can have several side effects, including the loss of non-sensitive information and the introduction of redundant information. Additionally, the running times of heuristic algorithms for sanitising data are high. To minimise negative effects and lower the execution time of the hiding process, we propose the G-ILP algorithm with a GPU parallel programming method for preprocessing and a new efficient constraint satisfaction problem for hiding data. The experimental evaluations of G-ILP show the algorithm's efficiency in terms of running time and its ability to minimise side effects in large datasets.

AB Because the distinct advantages of manifold-learning methods for feature extraction, Riemannian manifolds have been used extensively in image recognition tasks in recent years. However, large intra-class variation is a major problem for researchers. Although recent studies have alleviated this problem by extending nonlinear learning to Riemannian manifolds, important classification information may be lost when describing image sets with a single manifold. To address this problem, we design a novel discriminative multiple-manifold network (DMMNet) for image recognition. The Grassmann and symmetric positive definite manifold are first used simultaneously to model each image set. Then, the symmetric positive definite manifold and Grassmann manifold nonlinear learning blocks are devised to transform the data into low-dimensional manifold matrices to enhance their discriminability. A feature fusion layer is designed to fuse the complementary features of different manifolds, and a point-to-point hidden layer is devised to focus on more important feature maps. To acquire the importance of the manifold feature maps, a feature selection method based on manifold feature importance is designed to learn the corresponding weight coefficients. Finally, an output layer is used to map the optimal feature subset into the Euclidean space, such that the kernel discriminant analysis and K-nearest neighbor algorithm are applied. The proposed DMMNet is compared with state-of-the-art techniques on four datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DMMNet.

DE Multi-label learning; Multi-task learning; Transfer learning
AB In multi-label learning it has been widely assumed in the literature that, to obtain best accuracy, the dependence among the labels should be explicitly modeled. This premise led to a proliferation of methods offering techniques to learn and predict labels together (joint modeling). Even though it is now acknowledged that in many contexts a model of dependence is not required for optimal performance, such models continue to outperform independent models in some of those very contexts, suggesting alternative explanations for their performance beyond label dependence. In this article we turn the original premise of multi-label learning on its head, and approach the problem of joint-modeling specifically under the absence of any measurable dependence among task labels. The insights from this study allow us to design a method for cross-domain transfer learning which, unlike most contemporary methods of this type, is model-agnostic (any base model class can be considered) and does not require any access to source data. The results we obtain have important implications and we provide clear directions for future work, both in the areas of multi-label and transfer learning.

AB Tourists share opinions about Points of Interest (POIs) through online posts and social media platforms. Opinion mining is a popular technique for extracting feedback from tourists who visited various places hidden in reviews, which are used in several tourist applications that generally reflect their preference towards POI. On the other hand, a trip schema is difficult for tourists because they must pick up sequential POIs in unknown areas that meet their limitations and preferences. However, most prior trip suggestion methods are suboptimal for several reasons, including that they do not consider valuable user reviews and rely exclusively on left-to-right unidirectional discovery sequence models. This study proposes a Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) POI recommendation system for calculating user similarity based on opinions and preferences. In addition, it presents a method for discovering sequential trip recommendations with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) using a deep learning method. Furthermore, this neural hybrid framework identifies a list of optimal trip candidates by combining personalized POIs with multifaceted context. Furthermore, this method employs the valuable information contained in user posts and their demographic information on social media to mitigate the well-known cold start issue. In the experimental evaluation based on two datasets, Tripadvisor and Yelp, this hybrid method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods when considering F-Score, nDCG, RMSE, and MAP.

AB High-precision and safety control in face of disturbances and uncertainties is a challenging issue of both theoretical and practical importance. In this article, new adaptive anti-disturbance control schemes are proposed for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with composite disturbances, including additive disturbances, multiplicative actuator faults, and implicit disturbances deeply coupled with system states. Both the cases with known and unknown control/fault directions are investigated. By properly fusing the techniques of disturbance observers and adaptive compensation, it is shown that all closed-loop signals are globally uniformly bounded and the tracking error converges to zero asymptotically, no matter the control/fault directions are known or not. In the case of known directions, the proposed control scheme, for the first time, guarantees asymptotic tracking and L $_{\infty}$ tracking performance simultaneously in face of disturbances and actuator faults. Moreover, novel Nussbaum functions and a contradiction argument are introduced, which allow the system to have multiple unknown nonidentical control directions and unknown time-varying fault direction. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

TI TTN-FCN: A Tangut character classification framework by tree tensor
   network and fully connected neural network

ID IDENTIFICATION; STATES
AB The classification of Tangut characters plays a significant role in Western Xia research, and yet it is still a great challenge to recognize Tangut characters accurately due to the less inter-class similarity and smaller intra-class variation of Tangut character images. The main reason is that Tangut characters possess an extremely intricate construct despite some other character recognition methods emerging. For this reason, the authors propose a novel framework for Tangut character classification, named tree tensor network-fully connected neural network (TTN-FCN), in which TTN is embedded to fully connect neural network. Firstly, Tangut images are encoded into quantum product states without entanglement in pre-processing. Then the TTN is adopted to contract quantum product states to intermediate low dimensional quantum states. Finally, low dimensional quantum states are input to the FCN network to perform classification tasks. The Model is evaluated on the Tangut character dataset that is constructed from Tangut character-related documents by scanning and consists of 30,293 Tangut character images with 6077 categories. Experimental results show that TTN-FCN has a faster convergence speed and achieves classification precision (AC) of 99.98% and loss of 0.688% with the max batch size 2042, which outperforms 30 compared networks. Moreover, the proposed model can also be generalized to other character recognition, which enhances its potential for cultural relic research and development.

AB Scatter corrections are commonly applied to refine near-infrared (NIR) spectra. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of measurement errors when using ordinary least squares (OLS) for multiplicative scatter correction (MSC). Any measurement errors attached to the set-mean spectrum may attenuate the OLS slope and that in turn will affect the estimate of the intercept and the adjustment of the spectra when using MSC methods to mitigate scattering. A corrected least squares slope may be used instead to prevent this problem, although the impact of this approach on the final outcome will depend on the relative size of the measurement errors in the individual spectra and the set-mean spectrum. The errors-in-variables or type II regression model (also known as Deming regression) and its special cases, major axis (MA) and reduced major axis (RMA), are discussed and illustrated. The extent of OLS slope bias or attenuation is demonstrated as is the resulting MSC spectral distortion. Further modification to the MSC transformation method is also suggested. The influence of scattering correction (by MSC, standard normal variate (SNV) and detrending) and of using the maximum likelihood estimate of the slope for MSC on the prediction of chemical composition of Lucerne herbage from NIR spectra was assessed. The predictive performance was slightly improved by the use of scattering corrections with fairly minor differences among methods. Nonetheless, it seems well worth considering the use of type II regression models for assessing MSC application aiming at improving the goodness of prediction from NIR spectra.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS; OBJECT DETECTION
AB The region proposal network is indispensable to two-stage object detection methods. It generates a fixed number of proposals that are to be classified and regressed by detection heads to produce detection boxes. However, the fixed number of proposals may be too large when an image contains only a few objects but too small when it contains much more objects. Considering this, the authors explored determining a proper number of proposals according to the number of objects in an image to reduce the computational cost while improving the detection accuracy. Since the number of ground truth objects is unknown at the inference stage, the authors designed a simple but effective module to predict the number of foreground regions, which will be substituted for the number of objects for determining the proposal number. Experimental results of various two-stage detection methods on different datasets, including MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, and CrowdHuman showed that equipping the designed module increased the detection accuracy while decreasing the FLOPs of the detection head. For example, experimental results on the PASCAL VOC dataset showed that applying the designed module to Libra R-CNN and Grid R-CNN increased over 1.5 AP(50) while decreasing the FLOPs of detection heads from 28.6 G to nearly 9.0 G.

AB The Dubois-Prade operator can transform its parameter into different values when processing data, which can make it more flexible. Interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (IVq-ROFSs) give decision-makers more degrees of freedom. Combining the flexibility of the Dubois-Prade operators and the degrees of freedom of IVq-ROFSs, this paper proposes the interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy Dubois-Prade (IVq-ROFDP) operations and the interval-valued q-rung orthopair Dubois-Prade ordered weighted average (IVq-ROFDPOWA) operator under IVq-ROFSs. Built upon this, considering the interaction between the membership degree and nonmembership degree, the interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy interactive Dubois-Prade (IVq-ROFIDP) operations and the interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy interactive Dubois-Prade ordered weighted average (IVq-ROFIDPOWA) operator are further proposed, and their properties are studied. Finally, a new group decision-making method based on the IVq-ROFIDPOWA operator is proposed to solve the multiattribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem. The results of two case implementations and the sensitivity analysis show that the proposed operator and group decision-making method are feasible and effective. Furthermore, the comparative analysis shows that the group decision-making method proposed in this paper can better reflect the differences between alternatives.

TI Zero-shot temporal event localisation: Label-free, training-free,

SO IET COMPUTER VISION

DT Article
DE computer vision; video retrieval
AB Temporal event localisation (TEL) has recently attracted increasing attention due to the rapid development of video platforms. Existing methods are based on either fully/weakly supervised or unsupervised learning, and thus they rely on expensive data annotation and time-consuming training. Moreover, these models, which are trained on specific domain data, limit the model generalisation to data distribution shifts. To cope with these difficulties, the authors propose a zero-shot TEL method that can operate without training data or annotations. Leveraging large-scale vision and language pre-trained models, for example, CLIP, we solve the two key problems: (1) how to find the relevant region where the event is likely to occur; (2) how to determine event duration after we find the relevant region. Query guided optimisation for local frame relevance relying on the query-to-frame relationship is proposed to find the most relevant frame region where the event is most likely to occur. Proposal generation method relying on the frame-to-frame relationship is proposed to determine the event duration. The authors also propose a greedy event sampling strategy to predict multiple durations with high reliability for the given event. The authors' methodology is unique, offering a label-free, training-free, and domain-free approach. It enables the application of TEL purely at the testing stage. The practical results show it achieves competitive performance on the standard Charades-STA and ActivityCaptions datasets.

AB Infrared and visible image fusion aims to generate synthetic images including salient targets and abundant texture details. However, traditional techniques and recent deep learning-based approaches have faced challenges in preserving prominent structures and fine-grained features. In this study, we propose a lightweight infrared and visible image fusion network utilizing multi-scale attention modules and hybrid dilated convolutional blocks to preserve significant structural features and fine-grained textural details. First, we design a hybrid dilated convolutional block with different dilation rates that enable the extraction of prominent structure features by enlarging the receptive field in the fusion network. Compared with other deep learning methods, our method can obtain more high-level semantic information without piling up a large number of convolutional blocks, effectively improving the ability of feature representation. Second, distinct attention modules are designed to integrate into different layers of the network to fully exploit contextual information of the source images, and we leverage the total loss to guide the fusion process to focus on vital regions and compensate for missing information. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in both visual effects and evaluation metrics. The experimental results on public datasets show that our method can improve the entropy (EN) by 4.80%, standard deviation (SD) by 3.97%, correlation coefficient (CC) by 1.86%, correlations of differences (SCD) by 9.98%, and multi-scale structural similarity (MS_SSIM) by 5.64%, respectively. In addition, experiments with the VIFB dataset further indicate that our approach outperforms other comparable models.

AB Few-shot segmentation (FSS) enables rapid adaptation to the segmentation task of unseen-classes object based on a few labelled support samples. Currently, the focal point of research in the FSS field is to align features between support and query images, aiming to improve the segmentation performance. However, most existing FSS methods implement such support/query alignment by solely leveraging middle-level feature for generalization, ignoring the category semantic information contained in high-level feature, while pooling operation inevitably lose spatial information of the feature. To alleviate these issues, the authors propose the Iterative Segmentation Network Based on Feature Pyramid (FPIseg), which mainly consists of three modules: Feature Pyramid Fusion Module (FPFM), Region Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM), and Iterative Optimization Segmentation Module (IOSM). Firstly, FPFM fully utilizes the foreground information from the support image to implement support/query alignment under multi-scale, multi-level semantic backgrounds. Secondly, RFEM enhances the foreground detail information of aligned feature to improve generalization ability. Finally, ISOM iteratively segments the query image to optimize the prediction result and improve segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL-5(i) and COCO-20(i) datasets show that FPIseg achieves considerable segmentation performance under both 1-shot and 5-shot settings.

ID INFORMATION
AB Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is widely used in many domains, e.g. data mining. The unsupervised learning of the finite mixture (ULFM) model based on the minimum message length (MML) criterion for mixtures enables adaptive model selection and parameter estimates. However, some datasets have a hierarchical structure. If the MML criterion does not consider the hierarchical structure of the a priori, the a priori coding length in the criterion is inaccurate. It is difficult to achieve a good trade-off between the model's complexity and its goodness of fitting. Therefore, a locally consistent GMM with the hierarchical MML criterion (GM-HMML) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the MML criterion determines the mixing probability (annihilation of components). To accurately control the competition between these relative necessary components, a hierarchical MML is proposed. Secondly, the hierarchical MML criterion is regularized using the graph Laplacian. The manifold structure is incorporated into the parameter estimator to avoid possible overfitting problems caused by the fine-grained prior. The presented MML criterion enhances the degree of component annihilation, which not only does not annihilate the necessary components but also reduces the iterations. The proposed approach is testified on the real datasets and achieves good model order and clustering accuracy.

AB This study aims to provide a framework which enables decision-makers and researchers to identify AI technology patterns in renewable energy systems from a massive data set of textual data. However, the study was challenged by the Scopus database limitation that allows users to retrieve only 2000 documents per query. Therefore, we developed a search engine based on the Scopus Application Programming Interface (API) that enables us to download an unlimited number of documents per query based on our desirable settings. We extracted 5661 renewable energy systems-related publications from Scopus database and leveraged Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised algorithms to identify the most frequent computational science models and dense meta-topics and investigate their evolution throughout the period 2000-2021. Our findings showed 7 meta-topics based on the class-based Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (c-TD-IDF) score and term score decline graph. Emerging advanced algorithms, such as different deep learning architectures, directly impacted growing meta-topics involving problems with uncertainty and dynamic conditions.

ID DECISION
AB Three-way concept analysis is an integration of formal concept analysis and three-way decision, which has been found wide applications in knowledge representation, cognitive computing and decision sciences. There have been already a huge number of literature on theory and applications on such topics. Most researches on formal concept analysis focus, independently, on specific scenarios such as Boolean formal contexts and fuzzy formal contexts. In this paper, a unified framework for three-way concept analysis is built in lattice-valued formal contexts. The notions of positive concept and negative concept are given in a lattice-valued formal context based on an overlapping function, one of significant operators for information fusion. Two pairs of object induced adjunctive three-way concept operators and attribute induced adjunctive three-way concept operators are introduced. Their properties have been fully investigated. With those operators, the algebraic structures of adjunctive three-way concepts, their extensions and intensions have been explored. Specifically, the local structure within pairs of sub-concept and sup-concept has been finely characterized. The derived results provide ones a way to construct the complete lattice of a lattice-valued formal context or its sublattice by determining all pairs of sub-concept and sup-concept provided that an object fuzzy set or an attribute fuzzy set is given. A case analysis on a real world dataset from UCI repository is presented to verify the rationality and significance of obtained results.

ID IN-VIVO; EXCITATION; CORTEX; INPUT
AB Strong inhibitory recurrent connections can reduce the tendency for a neural network to become unstable. This is known as inhibitory stabilization; networks that are unstable in the absence of strong inhibitory feedback because of their unstable excitatory recurrent connections are known as Inhibition Stabilized Networks (ISNs). One of the characteristics of ISNs is their "paradoxical response", where perturbing the inhibitory neurons with additional excitatory input results in a decrease in their activity after a temporal delay instead of increasing their activity. Here, we develop a model of populations of neurons across different layers of cortex. Within each layer, there is one population of inhibitory neurons and one population of excitatory neurons. The connectivity weights across different populations in the model are derived from a synaptic physiology database provided by the Allen Institute. The model shows a gradient of excitation-inhibition balance across different layers in the cortex, where superficial layers are more inhibitory dominated compared to deeper layers. To investigate the presence of ISNs across different layers, we measured the membrane potentials of neural populations in the model after perturbing inhibitory populations. The results show that layer 2/3 in the model does not operate in the ISN regime but layers 4 and 5 do operate in the ISN regime. These results accord with neurophysiological findings that explored the presence of ISNs across different layers in the cortex. The results show that there may be a systematic macroscopic gradient of inhibitory stabilization across different layers in the cortex that depends on the level of excitation-inhibition balance, and that the strength of the paradoxical response increases as the model moves closer to bifurcation points.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB The rapid development of intelligent manufacturing technology has made data-driven fault diagnosis technology an important research at present. Most existing intelligent approaches, on the other hand, have a flaw: training and testing data are collected under the same operational conditions. As a result, a feature knowledge transfer learning method for rotating machinery fault detection is presented in this study to encourage the effective implementation of intelligent fault diagnosis. This method combines the domain adaptive ability of transfer learning and the ability of deep learning to automatically extract features Firstly, unsupervised convolutional auto-encoder is used for learning information from multiple source domains to construct feature subspace. Then adaptive learning rate, weight initialization and weight change algorithm are used to construct feature matching algorithm and incorporated into the stack-encoder. Finally, the encoder is used for diagnostic recognition of feature subspace information. Three datasets from various experimental platforms are used to validate the proposed method's efficacy. The experimental findings demonstrate the method's capacity to diagnose and identify multi-domain faults in bearings while having strong generalization and flexibility. Comparatively speaking, the proposed model may attain higher diagnostic accuracy with a rate of accuracy of above 98%. In addition, two additional analytical experiments were conducted. The findings demonstrate that the method may provide over-task transfer learning and reliable diagnostic results. And, it demonstrates how improved diagnostic models may be built with a good dataset of unlabeled source domains. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB IntroductionA hot cell is generally deployed with a teleoperation power manipulator to complete tests, operations, and maintenance. The position and pose of the manipulator are mostly acquired through radiation-resistant video cameras arranged in the hot cell. In this paper, deep learning-based target detection technology is used to establish an experimental platform to test the methods for target detection and pose estimation of teleoperation power manipulators using two cameras. MethodsIn view of the fact that a complex environment affects the precision of manipulator pose estimation, the dilated-fully convolutional one-stage object detection (dilated-FCOS) teleoperation power manipulator target detection algorithm is proposed based on the scale of the teleoperation power manipulator. Model pruning is used to improve the real-time performance of the dilated-FCOS teleoperation power manipulator target detection model. To improve the detection speed for the key points of the teleoperation power manipulator, the keypoint detection precision and model inference speed of different lightweight backbone networks were tested based on the SimpleBaseline algorithm. MobileNetv1 was selected as the backbone network to perform channel compression and pose distillation on the upsampling module so as to further optimize the inference speed of the model. Results and discussionCompared with the original model, the proposed model was experimentally proven to reach basically the same precision within a shorter inference time (only 58% of that of the original model). The experimental results show that the compressed model basically retains the precision of the original model and that its inference time is 48% of that of the original model.

AB In order to address a long standing challenge for internal medicine physicians we developed artificial intelligence (AI) models to identify patients at risk of increased mortality. After querying 2,425 records of patients transferred from non-intensive care units to intensive care units from the Veteran Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), we created two datasets. The former used 22 independent variables that included "Length of Hospital Stay" and "Days to Intensive Care Transfer," and the latter lacked these two variables. Since these two variables are unknown at the time of admission, the second set is more clinically relevant. We trained 16 machine learning models using both datasets. The best-performing models were fine-tuned and evaluated. The LightGBM model achieved the best results for both datasets. The model trained with 22 variables achieved a Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve-Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.89 and an accuracy of 0.72, with a sensitivity of 0.97 and a specificity of 0.68. The model trained with 20 variables achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.86 and an accuracy of 0.71, with a sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.67. The top features for the former model included "Total length of Stay," "Admit to ICU Transfer Days," and "Lymphocyte Next Lab Value." For the latter model, the top features included "Lymphocyte First Lab Value," "Hemoglobin First Lab Value," and "Hemoglobin Next Lab Value." Our clinically relevant predictive mortality model can assist providers in optimizing resource utilization when managing large caseloads, particularly during shift changes.

AB This article considers the fixed-time stability (FXTS) issue for discontinuous system described by differential equation (DE) with time-varying parameters. Using the tool of differential inclusion (DI), several improved FXTS criteria and estimation formulas of settling time (SET) are derived by employing a relaxed Lyapunov method. The special novelty of the developed Lyapunov method is that the derivative of Lyapunov function possesses indefiniteness. As an important application, the established FXTS theorems are utilized to deal with fixed-time (FXT) synchronization issue for fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) possessing state discontinuity, where the fuzzy operation is used in the synaptic law computing, and one typical time-varying switching control protocol is designed. Moreover, a series of estimations of SET for FXT synchronization are given out. Finally, the simulation examples are present to substantiate the validity of the obtained results.

AB The current shadow removal pipeline relies on the detected shadow masks, which have limitations for penumbras and tiny shadows, and results in an excessively long pipeline. To address these issues, we propose a shadow imaging bilinear model and design a novel three-branch residual (TBR) network for shadow removal. Our bilinear model reveals the single-image shadow removal process and can explain why simply increasing the brightness of shadow areas cannot remove shadows without artifacts. We considerably shorten the shadow removal pipeline by modeling illumination compensation and developing a single-stage shadow removal network without additional detection and refinement networks. Specifically, our network consists of three task branches, i.e., shadow image reconstruction, shadow matte estimation, and shadow removal. To merge these three branches and enhance the shadow removal branch, we design a model-based TBR module. Multiple TBR modules are cascaded to generate an intensive information flow and facilitate feature integration among the three branches. Thus, our network ensures the fidelity of nonshadow areas and restores the light intensity of shadow areas through three-branch collaboration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The model and code are available at https://github.com/nachifur/TBRNet.

AB As an advanced technique in remote sensing, hyper-spectral target detection (HTD) is widely concerned in civilian and military applications. However, the limitation of prior and heterogeneous backgrounds makes HTD models sensitive to data corruption under various interference from the environment. In this article, a novel united HTD framework based on the concept of transformer is proposed to extract [HTD based on transformer via spectral-spatial similarity (HTD-TS3)] under weak supervision, which opens up more flexible ways to study HTD. For the first time, the transformer mechanism is introduced into the HTD task to extract spectral and spatial features in a unified optimization procedure. By modeling long-range dependence among spectra, it realizes spectral spatial joint inference based on long-range context, which addresses the issues of insufficient utilization of spatial information. To provide samples for weakly supervised learning (WSL), the coarse sample selection and spectral sequence construction in an efficient way are proposed, which makes full use of limited prior information. Finally, an exponential constrained nonlinear function is adopted to acquire pixel-level prediction via combining discriminative spectral spatial features and coarse spatial information. Experiments on real hyperspectral images (HSIs) captured by different sensors at various scenes verify the effectiveness and efficiency of HTD-TS3.

AB The facility management (FM) has been suffering significant changes since the introduction of building information modeling (BIM) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operation (AECO) sector. However, there are still challenges in BIM implementation during the building use phase, such as the difficulties related to the personalization of the maintenance management information for each case, and modeling the as-built conditions. Disclosing building data to all the stakeholders involved in the building life cycle is also a challenging task. So, this paper aims to present an integrated solution for BIM-FM to categorize and prioritize maintenance management, with the resource to digital techniques. For this purpose, the methodology developed consists of 1-the recognition and preparation of the site conditions; 2-Image collection using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); 3-Image processing and software comparison; 4-Obtaining point cloud and its integration in a BIM software; 5-3D building modeling in Revit software, 5-Damage detection through Photogrammetry Point Cloud, and 6-Placement of building anomalies by means of placeholders. This work allows exploring BIM-FM representation and data integration for building condition assessment and its representation in a collaborative tool. This methodology will enhance the usability of BIM methodology in FM since it allows the data update in the model, avoids the information loss or fragmentation of the building life cycle and gives access to BIM users and non-users.

AB The interplay between neuronal network connectivity and neuron dynamics is known to drive global brain behavior; however, the exact relationship between network connectivity and node dynamics is complex and remains poorly understood. Previous theoretical and modeling work has shown that in small toy networks, when nodes are equipped with discrete quadratic dynamics, properties of the emergent behavior of the complex quadratic network (CQN) can give rise to features that relate to the underlying topology. Specifically, when the long-term behavior of CQNs is represented by asymptotic fractal sets, certain topological features of the fractal can be used to classify the network topology. However, the success of this approach has thus far not been tested on more complex real-world networks. Here, we apply a CQN modeling approach to capture individual differences in real-world brain networks derived from human connectome data. We show that CQNs are more sensitive than traditional graph theoretic measures at capturing individual differences in the topology of the human connectome, and that features of the associated equi-M sets can differentiate between male and female connectomes. This study, therefore, provides a basis upon which future work can build in order to better quantify individual differences in brain connectivity, and how these differences drive brain function and behavior.

ID VAN GOGH; STYLOMETRY; STYLE
AB In recent years, transformers, initially developed for language, have been successfully applied to visual tasks. Vision transformers have been shown to push the state of the art in a wide range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. While ample research has shown promising results in art attribution and art authentication tasks using convolutional neural networks, this paper examines whether the superiority of vision transformers extends to art authentication, improving, thus, the reliability of computer-based authentication of artworks. Using a carefully compiled dataset of authentic paintings by Vincent van Gogh and two contrast datasets, we compare the art authentication performances of Swin transformers with those of EfficientNet. Using a standard contrast set containing imitations and proxies (works by painters with styles closely related to van Gogh), we find that EfficientNet achieves the best performance overall. With a contrast set that only consists of imitations, we find the Swin transformer to be superior to EfficientNet by achieving an authentication accuracy of over 85%. These results lead us to conclude that vision transformers represent a strong and promising contender in art authentication, particularly in enhancing the computer-based ability to detect artistic imitations.

ID COOPERATIVE COEVOLUTION; INVERSE PROBLEMS
AB Physics informed neural network (PINN) has become a promising method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The loss function of PINN is a weighted sum of multiple items. This makes it easy to fall into local optima, especially the gradient pathologies when solving high frequency problems. The value of penalty coefficients has a crucial impact on the prediction results. Therefore, a new PINN with adaptive penalty coefficients iteratively optimized by biased multiobjective coevolutionary algorithm (BC-PINN) is presented. In BC-PINN, a two-stage optimization mechanism is used to search for parameters of neural network and penalty coefficients respectively. This method involves constructing the fitness function of penalty coefficients based on the biased dominance ranking by data item and regularization item. Compared with the previous works of others, the accuracy of fitting the initial conditions and boundary conditions is considered to be given priority, which is more conducive to PINN converging to the particular solution of PDE. In addition, the set of penalty coefficients is divided into multiple populations to improve the optimization efficiency through coevolutionary algorithm. The empirical results show that: (1) Our method can improve the gradient pathologies and effectively capture the high-frequency features. (2) Compared to the original PINN, it reduces the MSE by 1-6 orders of magnitude in our benchmark functions.

ID ROBUST FACE RECOGNITION; SPARSE; REPRESENTATION
AB To address image classification challenges caused by noisy disturbances, we propose a new algorithm called structurally incoherent adaptive weighted low-rank matrix decomposition (SIAWLR). This method divides the raw image matrix into a low-rank denoised matrix, which retains all the information of images, and a sparse error matrix that captures the noise components. The incorporation of structural incoherence in the low-rank matrix and the utilization of adaptive weights in the error matrix significantly enhance the classification performance. To solve the SIAWLR, we propose an integrated algorithm consisting of two steps. Firstly, we employ the augmented lagrangian alternating direction method (ALADM) (Shen et al., Optim Methods Softw 29(2), 239-263, 2014) to solve the SIAWLR. Subsequently, we classify the images based on the obtained low-rank matrix. In comparison to other methods, SIAWLR exhibits computational attractiveness as it requires fewer parameters, often determined through cross validation. We conduct experiments comparing the proposed method with four other methods on three datasets. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that SIAWLR outperforms the other methods in terms of classification accuracy.

AB With the rapid development of personalized recommendation technology for big data, online data resources have undergone a rapid expansion, presenting features such as complex structure and diverse forms. For the purpose of improving recommendation accuracy, we adopt the idea of divide and conquer to construct a novel hybrid temporal prediction model to adapt to the features of different user interest data fluctuations. Firstly, the users' data is divided into small and large ranges through fluctuation thresholds. Meanwhile, we introduce a global dynamic factor to adjust the temporal weight decay of the sequence data, and then use the neural network to regress and predict the small range fluctuation series data, at the same time, the large range fluctuation series data is predicted by dividing the fuzzy relationship through the membership degree of fuzzy clustering. Finally, through simulation recommendation experiments, model ablation experiments, and iterative performance experiments by using 8 baseline models and 7 datasets, the results show that the F1 index of the proposed model has increased by an average of 13.21%, the NDCG index has increased by an average of 15.96%, and the convergence iterations are within 600 times. More accurate prediction results can be received through extraction of data feature for different interest fluctuations, which is helpful for optimizing personalized information recommendation services.

AB As an efficient assessment technique, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) plays a critical role in conducting risk analyses of production and decision-making. In FMEA, the determination of the risk priority number (RPN) is the most important stage used to prioritize potential failure modes. However, the elicited RPN oftentimes contains uncertainty. Information fractal dimension is a measure of uncertainty and complexity for probability distributions. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a novel exponential information fractal dimension weighted RPN (IFDRPN). Probability distributions of assessments are provided by experts. Then, the information fractal dimension is calculated with the consideration of the uncertainty of each piece of assessment information. Furthermore, the relative importance of experts based on variable backgrounds and authorities is also taken into consideration. The corresponding FMEA is capable of measuring uncertainty and complexity in opinions for failure modes to facilitate assessment. An application of rotor blades for an aircraft turbine, along with the risk assessment in hydropower finance project, are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FMEA approach.

AB This research focuses mainly on the spherical asymmetric multiple traveling salesman problem (AMTSP). Three-dimension AMTSP is an extension of the AMTSP, it arranges all cities and paths on the three-dimension sphere. Therefore, the AMTSP is more challenging but also has more research value. An improved hybrid algorithm called spherical vector-based artificial gorilla troops optimization (SGTO) with a discrete state transition strategy to deal with the three-dimension sphere asymmetric multiple traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm updates positions in spherical coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates. By combining the discrete state transition algorithm's swap, shift, symmetric, and substitute operators, it enriches the population's diversity and enhances the efficiency of local searches. Numerical simulation results show that SGTO outperformed the basic GTO and other classical metaheuristic algorithms in solving the spherical AMTSP.

AB Semantic segmentation is a hot research issue in the field of image processing. The introduction of depth images improves the effect of semantic segmentation. However, most existing methods do not take into account the differences between RGB and depth features, leading to poor segmentation accuracy. To fully utilize the RGB and depth features, an asymmetric two-branch convolutional neural network structure is proposed in this paper. In the depth feature extraction branch, a feature enhancement module is proposed to reduce noise. Meanwhile, in the branch of RGB feature extraction, a skip connection structure is introduced to extract more abundant RGB features. In addition, a fusion module based on attention mechanism is proposed to make full use of the effective information from the two modals. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, and the results show that the proposed model can complete the semantic segmentation task for indoor scenes efficiently.

AB Federated learning (FL) based intelligent fault diagnosis has developed rapidly in recent years owing to the need for data privacy. However, models trained using FL may suffer from performance degradation when applied to unseen domains. In this regard, we propose a federated domain generalization approach using a pseudo-Siamese network (PSN) and robust model aggregation for intelligent fault diagnosis. Firstly, the proposed method employs PSN to calculate the discrepancy between client and global models at the local clients. This enhances the feature space boundary of fault diagnosis models. Then the proposed method computes cross-classification losses of locally trained global models on the central server for robust model aggregation. Finally, we evaluate our approach through experiments where local clients contain data from varying datasets. Experimental results on the proposed method and other transfer learning and federated learning methods prove the outperformance of the proposed method.

AB Strategic spatial planning is becoming more popular around the world as a decision-making way to build a unified vision for directing the medium- to long-term development of land/marine areas. Recently, the study of marine areas in terms of spatial planning such as Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has received much attention. One of the challenging issues in MSP is to make a balance between determining the ideal zone for a new activity while also considering the locations of existing activities. This spatial zoning problem for multi-uses with multiple objectives could be formulated as optimization models. This paper presents and compares the results of two multi-objective evolutionary-based algorithms (MOEAs), Synchronous Hypervolume-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (SH-NSGA-II) which is an extension of NSGA-II and a memetic algorithm (MA) in which SH-NSGA-II is enhanced with a local search. These proposed algorithms are used to solve the multi-objective spatial zoning optimization problem, which seeks to maximize the zone interest value assigned to the new activity while simultaneously maximizing its spatial compactness. We introduce several innovations in these proposed algorithms to address the problem constraints and to improve the robustness of the traditional NSGA-II and MA approaches. Unlike traditional ones, a different stop condition, multiple crossover, mutation, and repairing operators, and also a local search operator are developed. A comparative study is presented between the results obtained using both algorithms. To guarantee robust results for both algorithms, their parameters are calibrated and tuned using the Multi-Response Surface Methodology (MRSM) method. The effective and non-effective components, as well as the validity of the regression models, are determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Although SH-NSGA-II has revealed a good efficiency, its performance is still improved using a local search scheme within SH-NSGA-II, which is specially tailored to the problem characteristics. The two methods are designed for raster data.

AB Data hallucination generates additional training examples for novel classes to alleviate the data scarcity problem in few-shot learning (FSL). Existing hallucination-based FSL methods normally train a general embedding model first by applying information extracted from base classes that have abundant data. In those methods, hallucinators are then built upon the trained embedding model to generate data for novel classes. However, these hallucination methods usually rely on general-purpose embeddings, limiting their ability to generate task-oriented samples for novel classes. Recent studies have shown that task-specific embedding models, which are adapted to novel tasks, can achieve better classification performance. To improve the performance of example hallucination for tasks, a task-oriented embedding model is used in the proposed method to perform task-oriented generation. After the initialization, the hallucinator is finetuned by applying a task-oriented embedding model with the guidance of a teacher-student mechanism. The proposed task-oriented hallucination method contains two steps. An initial embedding network and an initial hallucinator are trained with a base dataset in the first step. The second step contains a pseudo-labelling process where the base dataset is pseudo-labelled using support data of the few-shot task and a task-oriented fine-tuning process where the embedding network and hallucinator are adjusted simultaneously. Both the embedding network and the hallucinator are updated with the support set and the pseudo-labelled base dataset using knowledge distillation. The experiments are conducted on four popular few-shot datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 0.8% to 4.08% increases in classification accuracy for 5-way 5-shot tasks. It also achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods for 5-way 1-shot tasks.

AB The exponentially increasing amount of data generated by the public on social media platforms is a precious source of information. It can be used to find the topics and analyze the comments. Some researchers have extended the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method by adding a sentiment layer to simultaneously find the topics and their related sentiments. However, most of these approaches do not achieve admirable accuracy in Topic Sentiment Analysis (TSA), particularly when there is insufficient training data or the texts are complex, ambiguous, and short. In this paper, a self-supervised novel approach called SSTSA is proposed for TSA that extracts the hidden topics and analyzes the total sentiment related to each topic. The SSTSA proposes a new method called Pseudo-label Generator. For this purpose, first, it employs semantic similarity and Word Mover's Distance (WMD) measures. Then, the document embedding technique is employed to semantically estimate the sentiment orientation of samples and generate the pseudo-labels (positive or negative). Afterward, a hybrid classifier composed of a pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT (RoBERTa) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is trained to predict the sentiment of unseen data. The evaluation results on different datasets of various domains demonstrate that the SSTSA outperforms similar unsupervised/self-supervised methods.

ID NYSTROM METHOD; KERNEL; MATRIX
AB Domain adaptation (DA) improves the generalization ability of models across source and target domains with different distributions. Current methods aim to reduce domain distribution divergence to learn transferable features. However, in most real cases, the number of available labeled samples is limited, and annotating labels requires significant time and labor costs, making it difficult to achieve high accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called Deep Geometric and Statistic Alignment for Fewer labeled Domain Adaptation (GSA4FDA). This method achieves the target task with fewer labeled source samples by combining manifold learning and leveraging the local geometric structure of sufficient unlabeled source samples. For domain alignment, we employ a joint geometric-statistical alignment and embed it into a specific layer of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to obtain high-level semantic information, taking into account the complementary nature of the two aspects. Specifically, we use the Nystrom method and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compensate for the geometrical and statistical shift between domains. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly when there are limited labeled source samples available.

   language-structure reasoning
AB Referring image segmentation is a multimodal joint task that aims to segment linguistically indicated objects from images in paired expressions and images. However, the diversity of language annotations trends to result in semantic ambiguity, which makes the semantic representation of language feature encoding imprecise. Existing methods ignore the correction of language encoding module, so that the semantic error of language features cannot be improved in the subsequent process, resulting in semantic deviation. To this end, we propose a vision-aware language reasoning model. Intuitively, the segmentation result can be used to guide the reconstruction of language features, which could be expressed as a tree-structured recursive process. Specifically, we designed a language reasoning encoding module and a mask loopback optimization module to optimize the language encoding tree. The feature weights of tree nodes are learned through backpropagation. In order to overcome the problem that local language words and visual regions are easily introduced into noise regions in the traditional attention module, we use the global language prior information to calculate the importance of different words to further weight the visual region features, which could be embodied as language-aware vision attention module. Our experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves performance improvement.

AB Nowadays, people face various societal challenges in their daily lives related to air pollution. With many causes of human fastest lifestyle, different metro cities of India are polluted daily. Air pollution is the most significant societal problem in metropolitan cities in India. People have various health issues due to the air pollution problem in the metro cities. Kolkata is not an exception because Kolkata is India's second most polluted metro city. With decision-making approaches, we can reduce air pollution in a city. So making the proper decision is the primary focus of reducing air pollution problems. We can easily discover the most affected causes of air pollution in this city through the decision-making approaches. Therefore, we have developed a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique and applied it to the air pollution model in Kolkata city. The main contribution of this research is that we invented a possibilistic ranking index of bipolar fuzzy (BpF) numbers based on the possibilistic mean and variance and applied it to the air pollution model. Using the possibilistic ranking index determined the criteria weight of air pollution MCDM model under BpF environment. Due to many uncertainty and negative aspects, the alternative information BpF numbers consider the air pollution MCDM model. The BpF numbers deal with both positive and negative aspects of the causes of pollution in the air pollution MCDM model. By BpF environment, the possibilistic index ranking method efficiently solves the air pollution MCDM model. Finally, a numerical illustration has been presented to demonstrate the applicability and feasibility of our suggested approach.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Graph fusion; graph learning; multi-view clustering (MVC); unpaired data
ID ALGORITHM; ROBUST
AB Multi-view clustering (MVC), which effectively fuses information from multiple views for better performance, has received increasing attention. Most existing MVC methods assume that multi-view data are fully paired, which means that the mappings of all corresponding samples between views are predefined or given in advance. However, the data correspondence is often incomplete in real-world applications due to data corruption or sensor differences, referred to as the data-unpaired problem (DUP) in multi-view literature. Although several attempts have been made to address the DUP issue, they suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) most methods focus on the feature representation while ignoring the structural information of multi-view data, which is essential for clustering tasks; 2) existing methods for partially unpaired problems rely on pregiven cross-view alignment information, resulting in their inability to handle fully unpaired problems; and 3) their inevitable parameters degrade the efficiency and applicability of the models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel parameter-free graph clustering framework termed unpaired multi-view graph clustering framework with cross-view structure matching (UPMGC-SM). Specifically, unlike the existing methods, UPMGC-SM effectively utilizes the structural information from each view to refine cross-view correspondences. Besides, our UPMGC-SM is a unified framework for both the fully and partially unpaired multi-view graph clustering. Moreover, existing graph clustering methods can adopt our UPMGC-SM to enhance their ability for unpaired scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both paired and unpaired datasets.

   classification
AB Model filter pruning has shown efficiency in compressing deep convolutional neural networks by removing unimportant filters without sacrificing the performance. However, most existing criteria are empirical, and overlook the relationship between channel saliencies and the non-linear activation functions within the networks. To address these problems, we propose a novel channel pruning method coined gradient flow based saliency (GFBS). Instead of relying on the magnitudes of the entire feature maps, GFBS evaluates the channel saliencies from the gradient flow perspective and only requires the information in normalization and activation layers. Concretely, we first integrate the effects of normalization and ReLU activation layers into convolutional layers based on Taylor expansion. Then, through backpropagation, the derived channel saliency of each layer is indicated by of the first-order Taylor polynomial of the scaling parameter and the signed shifting parameter in the normalization layers. To validate the efficiency and generalization ability of GFBS, we conduct extensive experiments on various tasks, including image classification (CIFAR, ImageNet), image denoising, object detection, and 3D object classification. GFBS could feasibly cooperate with the baseline networks and compress them with only negligible performance drop. Moreover, we extended our method to pruning scratch networks and GFBS is capable to identify subnetworks with comparable performance with the baseline model at an early training stage. Our code has been released at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/ GFBS.

DE Hardware efficiency; Supernet; Vision transformer
AB We attempt to reduce the computational costs in vision transformers (ViTs), which increase quadratically in the token number. We present a novel training paradigm that trains only one ViT model at a time, but is capable of providing improved image recognition performance with various computational costs. Here, the trained ViT model, termed super vision transformer (SuperViT), is empowered with the versatile ability to solve incoming patches of multiple sizes as well as preserve informative tokens with multiple keeping rates (the ratio of keeping tokens) to achieve good hardware efficiency for inference, given that the available hardware resources often change from time to time. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that our SuperViT can considerably reduce the computational costs of ViT models with even performance increase. For example, we reduce 2 x FLOPs of DeiT-S while increasing the Top-1 accuracy by 0.2% and 0.7% for 1.5 x reduction. Also, our SuperViT significantly outperforms existing studies on efficient vision transformers. For example, when consuming the same amount of FLOPs, our SuperViT surpasses the recent state-of-the-art EViT by 1.1% when using DeiT-S as their backbones. The project of this work is made publicly available at https://github.com/lmbxmu/SuperViT.

DE Convolutional neural networks (CNN); geographical point data; sampling;

AB Numerous sampling strategies have been proposed to reduce the visual clutter of large-scale geographical point data visualization, which focus on the preservation of original data features, such as randomness, spatial distribution, and associated relationship. However, user preferences and demands are not taken into account in the course of sampling, which will lead to the sampled results deviating from user requirements and impede personalized geospatial analysis in specific application scenarios. In this article, we propose a user-driven sampling model for the visual abstraction of the large-scale geographical point data based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). First, a blue noise sampling model is applied to partition the geographical space into local areas, and a set of visual interfaces are designed to present the data features of those points in the local areas, enabling users to visually select representative points according to their requirements. Then, user preferences are quantified with a CNN model based on the eigenvectors of the representative points, which are further utilized to guide the sampling courses of the other local areas. Thus, all the sampled points will retain the spatial distribution of original data points and fulfill the user preference as far as possible. In addition, we implement a visualization framework to integrate manual point selection, CNN training, automatic point sampling, and visual comparison, allowing users to easily obtain and evaluate the sampled points from the perspectives of data analysis and user requirements. Quantitative comparisons and case studies based on real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our sampling model in the preservation of user preferences and visual exploration of large-scale geospatial point data.

AB For any digital application with document images such as retrieval, the classification of document images becomes an essential stage. Conventionally for the purpose, the full versions of the documents, that is the uncompressed document images make the input dataset, which poses a threat due to the big volume required to accommodate the full versions of the documents. Therefore, it would be novel, if the same classification task could be accomplished directly (with some partial decompression) with the compressed representation of documents in order to make the whole process computationally more efficient. In this research work, a novel deep learning model-DWT-CompCNN-is proposed for classification of documents that are compressed using High Throughput JPEG 2000 (HTJ2K) algorithm. The proposed DWT-CompCNN comprises of five convolutional layers with filter sizes of 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256 consecutively for each increasing layer to improve learning from the wavelet coefficients extracted from the compressed images. Experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets, Tobacco-3482 and RVL-CDIP, which demonstrate that the proposed model is time and space efficient, and also achieves a better classification accuracy in compressed domain.

SO CAAI TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article; Early Access
DE deep learning; image processing
AB Generating a realistic person's image from one source pose conditioned on another different target pose is a promising computer vision task. The previous mainstream methods mainly focus on exploring the transformation relationship between the keypoint-based source pose and the target pose, but rarely investigate the region-based human semantic information. Some current methods that adopt the parsing map neither consider the precise local pose-semantic matching issues nor the correspondence between two different poses. In this study, a Region Semantics-Assisted Generative Adversarial Network (RSA-GAN) is proposed for the pose-guided person image generation task. In particular, a regional pose-guided semantic fusion module is first developed to solve the imprecise match issue between the semantic parsing map from a certain source image and the corresponding keypoints in the source pose. To well align the style of the human in the source image with the target pose, a pose correspondence guided style injection module is designed to learn the correspondence between the source pose and the target pose. In addition, one gated depth-wise convolutional cross-attention based style integration module is proposed to distribute the well-aligned coarse style information together with the precisely matched pose-guided semantic information towards the target pose. The experimental results indicate that the proposed RSA-GAN achieves a 23% reduction in LPIPS compared to the method without using the semantic maps and a 6.9% reduction in FID for the method with semantic maps, respectively, and also shows higher realistic qualitative results.

ID OBJECTS GRAB ATTENTION
AB The positional information of objects is crucial to enable robots to perform grasping and pushing manipulations in clutter. To effectively perform grasping and pushing manipulations, robots need to perceive the position information of objects, including the coordinates and spatial relationship between objects (e.g., proximity, adjacency). The authors propose an end-to-end position-aware deep Q-learning framework to achieve efficient collaborative pushing and grasping in clutter. Specifically, a pair of conjugate pushing and grasping attention modules are proposed to capture the position information of objects and generate high-quality affordance maps of operating positions with features of pushing and grasping operations. In addition, the authors propose an object isolation metric and clutter metric based on instance segmentation to measure the spatial relationships between objects in cluttered environments. To further enhance the perception capacity of position information of the objects, the authors associate the change in the object isolation metric and clutter metric in cluttered environment before and after performing the action with reward function. A series of experiments are carried out in simulation and real-world which indicate that the method improves sample efficiency, task completion rate, grasping success rate and action efficiency compared to state-of-the-art end-to-end methods. Noted that the authors' system can be robustly applied to real-world use and extended to novel objects. Supplementary material is available at .

TI Pseudo-trilateral adversarial training for domain adaptive
   traversability prediction
SO AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access

   alignment
AB Traversability prediction is a fundamental perception capability for autonomous navigation. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely used to predict traversability during the last decade. The performance of DNNs is significantly boosted by exploiting a large amount of data. However, the diversity of data in different domains imposes significant gaps in the prediction performance. In this work, we make efforts to reduce the gaps by proposing a novel pseudo-trilateral adversarial model that adopts a coarse-to-fine alignment (CALI) to perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Our aim is to transfer the perception model with high data efficiency, eliminate the prohibitively expensive data labeling, and improve the generalization capability during the adaptation from easy-to-access source domains to various challenging target domains. Existing UDA methods usually adopt a bilateral zero-sum game structure. We prove that our CALI model-a pseudo-trilateral game structure is advantageous over existing bilateral game structures. This proposed work bridges theoretical analyses and algorithm designs, leading to an efficient UDA model with easy and stable training. We further develop a variant of CALI-Informed CALI, which is inspired by the recent success of mixup data augmentation techniques and mixes informative regions based on the results of CALI. This mixture step provides an explicit bridging between the two domains and exposes under-performing classes more during training. We show the superiorities of our proposed models over multiple baselines in several challenging domain adaptation setups. To further validate the effectiveness of our proposed models, we then combine our perception model with a visual planner to build a navigation system and show the high reliability of our model in complex natural environments.

ID MOVEMENTS
AB The majority of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNESs) are brought on by psychogenic causes, but because their symptoms resemble those of epilepsy, they are frequently misdiagnosed. Although EEG signals are normal in PNES cases, electroencephalography (EEG) recordings alone are not sufficient to identify the illness. Hence, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment depend on long-term video EEG data and a complete patient history. Video EEG setup, however, is more expensive than using standard EEG equipment. To distinguish PNES signals from conventional epileptic seizure (ES) signals, it is crucial to develop methods solely based on EEG recordings. The proposed study presents a technique utilizing short-term EEG data for the classification of inter-PNES, PNES, and ES segments using time-frequency methods such as the Continuous Wavelet transform (CWT), Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT), CWT-based synchrosqueezed transform (WSST), and STFT-based SST (FSST), which provide high-resolution time-frequency representations (TFRs). TFRs of EEG segments are utilized to generate 13 joint TF (J-TF)-based features, four gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based features, and 16 higher-order joint TF moment (HOJ-Mom)-based features. These features are then employed in the classification procedure. Both three-class (inter-PNES versus PNES versus ES: ACC: 80.9%, SEN: 81.8%, and PRE: 84.7%) and two-class (Inter-PNES versus PNES: ACC: 88.2%, SEN: 87.2%, and PRE: 86.1%; PNES versus ES: ACC: 98.5%, SEN: 99.3%, and PRE: 98.9%) classification algorithms performed well, according to the experimental results. The STFT and FSST strategies surpass the CWT and WSST strategies in terms of classification accuracy, sensitivity, and precision. Moreover, the J-TF-based feature sets often perform better than the other two.

ID DESIGN
AB An Improved Cascade Chaotic Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm (ICCIWO) is proposed, employing cascade chaotic maps in the structure of a metaheuristic optimisation algorithm. The main aim of this modification is to provide a new algorithm for tuning the parameters of controllers. Conventionally, invasive weed optimisation algorithms (IWO) have been utilised in the literature to solve optimisation problems. The IWO has merits, namely fast convergence and high extraction capability. However, the IWO suffers from a lack of population diversity and poor exploration. Two novel improvements are proposed here to eliminate these disadvantages, based on utilising chaotic behaviours in the population generation and in the standard deviation update rule. The final proposed mechanism is applied to tune the parameters of a PID controller and solve several benchmark optimisation problems. Simulation analysis compares the performance of the proposed method with a recent similar approach. The simulation results validate the high performance of the proposed novel cascade chaotic scheme.

AB Many recent studies have shown that Fractal Dimension (FD), a ratio for figuring out the complexity of a system given its measurements, can be used as an useful index to provide information about certain brain disease. Our research focuses on the Alzheimer's disease changes in white and grey brain matters detected through the FD indexes of their contours. Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Neuroimaging Initiative database (Normal Condition, N = 57, and Alzheimer's Disease, N = 60). After standard preprocessing pipeline, the white and grey matter 3D FD indexes are computed for the two groups. A statistical analysis shows that only grey matter 3D FD indexes are able to differentiate healthy and AD subjects. Although white matter 3D FD indexes do not, it is remarkable that their presence enhance the separation capability of previous ones. In order to valuate the classification capability of these indexes on healthy and AD subjects, we define several Neural Networks models. The performances of these models vary according to the statistical analysis and reach their best performances when each 3D FD input index is changed into a sequence of 2D FD indexes of (a subset of) the horizontal slices of the white and grey matter volumes.

AB Query graph construction aims to construct the correct executable SPARQL on the KG to answer natural language questions. Although recent methods have achieved good results using neural network-based query graph ranking, they suffer from three new challenges when handling more complex questions: 1) complicated SPARQL syntax, 2) huge search space, and 3) locally ambiguous query graphs. In this paper, we provide a new solution. As a preparation, we extend the query graph by treating each SPARQL clause as a subgraph consisting of vertices and edges and define a unified graph grammar called AQG to describe the structure of query graphs. Based on these concepts, we propose a novel end-to-end model that performs hierarchical autoregressive decoding to generate query graphs. The high-level decoding generates an AQG as a constraint to prune the search space and reduce the locally ambiguous query graph. The bottom-level decoding accomplishes the query graph construction by selecting appropriate instances from the preprepared candidates to fill the slots in the AQG. The experimental results show that our method greatly improves the SOTA performance on complex KGQA benchmarks. Equipped with pre-trained models, the performance of our method is further improved, achieving SOTA for all three datasets used.

DE Knowledge graph embedding; entity alignment; adaptive embedding fusion
AB Entity alignment-the discovery of identical entities across different knowledge graphs (KGs)-is a critical task in data fusion. In this paper, we revisit existing entity alignment methods in practical and challenging scenarios. Our empirical studies show that current work has a low level of robustness to long-tail entities and the lack of entity names or relation triples. We aim to develop a robust and adaptive entity alignment method, and the availability of relations, attributes, or names is not required. Our method consists of an attribute encoder and a relation encoder, representing an entity by aggregating its attributes or relational neighbors using the attention mechanisms that can highlight the useful attributes and relations in end-to-end learning. To let the encoders complement each other and produce a coherent representation space, we propose adaptive embedding fusion via a gating mechanism. We consider four evaluation settings, i.e., the conventional setting with both relation and attribute triples, as well as three challenging settings without attributes, without relations, without both relations and names, respectively. Results show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Even in the most challenging setting without relations and names, our method can still achieve promising results while existing methods fail.

AB Non-negativematrix factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and clustering. However, the interpretation of the clustering result from NMF is difficult, especially for the high-dimensional biological data without effective feature selection. To address this problem, we introduce a row-sparse NMF with l(2,0)-norm constraint (NMF_l(20)), where the basis matrix W is constrained by using the l(2,0)-norm constraint such that W has a row-sparsity pattern with feature selection. However, it is a challenge to solve the model, because the l(2,0)-norm constraint is a non-convex and non-smooth function. Fortunately, we prove that the l(2,0)-norm constraint satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. Based on this finding, we present a proximal alternating linearized minimization algorithm and its monotone accelerated version to solve the NMF_l(20) model. In addition, we further present a orthogonal NMF with (2,0)-norm constraint (ONMF_l(20)) to enhance the clustering performance by using a non-negative orthogonal constraint. The ONMF_l(20) model is solved by transforming into a series of constrained and penalized matrix factorization problems. The convergence and guarantees for these proposed algorithms are proved and the computational complexity is well evaluated. The results on numerical and scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our methods in comparison with existing methods.

   consistency heuristic
AB Programming-by-example (PBE) is a program synthesis technique that automatically synthesizes computer programs from input-output (I/O) examples. There are many approaches to program synthesis, and one of the most commonly used solutions is to perform a search over the space of programs. In this paper, we present a novel program synthesis algorithm based on context consistency heuristic (PSACC) that differs from previous heuristic methods. We consider the input-output example as a state and develop a deep neural network-based predictor called DHFnet. DHFnet has the ability to map the current state to the first two instructions of the program which achieves the current state. By considering the current state and its subsequent state obtained by executing the corresponding instruction, we design a context consistency-based search algorithm. Our search algorithm enables a more reasonable and efficient selection of instructions in the program, by judging whether the instructions maintain the context consistency between the current state and its subsequent state. Furthermore, under the same experimental and testing environments, PSACC successfully enhances the success rate of program synthesis by 2-5%, and reduces the synthesis time compared to the baseline method. PSACC also exhibits better synthesis efficiency in terms of comprehensive performance compared to existing program synthesis methods.

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB In recent years, deep convolution neural networks have made significant progress in single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, high-resolution (HR) images obtained by most SISR reconstruction methods still suffer from edge blur-ring and texture distortion. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage feature enhancement network (TFEN) for the SISR reconstruction to realize nonlinear mapping from low-resolution (LR) images to HR images. In the first stage, an initial feature reconstruction module (IFRM) is constructed by combining a feature attention enhancement block and multiple convolution layers that simulate degradation and reconstruction operations to reconstruct a coarse HR image. In the second stage, based on the extracted features and the coarse HR image in the first stage, multiple residual attention modules (RAMs) consisting of the proposed spatial feature enhancement blocks (SFEBs) and an attention interaction block (AIB) are cascaded to generate the final HR image. In RAM, the SFEB is designed to learn more refined features for the reconstruction by adopting dilated convolutions and constructing spatial feature enhancement block, and the AIB is built to enhance the important features learned by RAMs through constructing multi-directional attention maps. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method has better performance than some current state-of-the-art SISR networks.

AB This study is rooted in the direct correlation between the performance of multivariate techniques and the selection of parameters. The complexity and time-consuming nature of parameter selection, due to the need for exhaustive testing of all available parameters for optimal results, is acknowledged. To mitigate this issue, a novel software tool, integrating nine nature-inspired optimization methods (Differential Evolution, Artificial Bee Colony, Particle Swarm, Cat Swarm, Dragonfly, Black Hole, Bacterial Foraging, Genetic Algorithms, and Simulated Annealing), is proposed. These methods are employed in histogram stretching, a parameter-dependent contrast enhancement technique, with multiplication, addition, and root extraction operations as the target parameters for optimization. In addition to this, histogram equalization, a parameter-independent contrast enhancement technique, is included for the purpose of comparative performance analysis. The software tool, publicly available, provides four performance metrics namely, Mean Square Error, Peak Signal-to-noise Ratio, Structural Similarity Index, and processing times. A rigorous evaluation using the widely recognized Tampere Image dataset indicates that Differential Evolution emerged as the most efficient technique, scoring highest for Structural Similarity Index (0.948) and second best for Mean Square Error (278.05) and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (26.962). Furthermore, Particle Swarm Optimization demonstrated the fastest time complexity, requiring merely 0.6 sec per image for parameter definition. Notably, it was observed that while histogram equalization tends to degrade original images, the adaptive nature of optimized histogram stretching remains preserved, thereby leaving the image quality unaffected. Such findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed software tool in the optimization and evaluation of contrast enhancement techniques.

AB The recent emergence of COVID-19 has posed substantial challenges to global health sectors. Given the significant impact of the virus on lung tissues, chest radiography has become a crucial tool in the early screening, detection, and continual monitoring of suspected cases. Among several technologies, X-ray imaging stands as a readily available and promising modality for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. This study presents a methodology for distinguishing between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 chest X-ray images, leveraging deep feature extraction and pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Deep features are extracted using the pre-trained deep CNN models and subsequently fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for end-to-end training. The observational data set comprised 200 X-ray images from non-COVID individuals and 180 from those diagnosed with COVID-19. Image classification was carried out using a variety of models including Visual Geometric Group 16 (VGG16), Visual Geometric Group 19 (VGG19), InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50, MobileNet, and DenseNet121, yielding average accuracies of 92.7%, 94.46%, 78.1%, 90.6%, 80.7%, 65%, and 93.4% respectively. However, the inclusion of LSTM networks significantly improved the performance of these models in differentiating between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of various CNN models supplemented with an LSTM network, utilizing chest X-ray images. The outcomes of this study suggest that the proposed methodology could potentially aid clinicians in enhancing their diagnostic accuracy concerning COVID-19.

AB In the wake of the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) era and the increasing prevalence of image-based applications on mobile platforms, a significant demand for computing resources has been witnessed. While traditional cloud computing has been limited by substantial transmission distances and notable response delays, mobile edge computing, where communication, computation, and storage resources are situated on edge devices, has emerged as a superior alternative. In this context, the challenge of offloading image processing tasks for multiple users, especially considering the collaboration of edge servers under computational and communication resource constraints, is investigated. A primary objective is to strike a balance between energy consumption and task delays, thereby aiming to curtail the total associated costs. The novel framework introduced, termed as Image Collaborative Task Offloading System using Deep Reinforcement Learning (I-CTOS-DRL), is specifically designed for image processing tasks in edge-cloud collaborative scenarios. Through the integration of a set updating mechanism, complications arising from interactions with neighboring edge servers are effectively diminished. Simultaneously, a heuristic algorithm was constructed to identify the most viable servers for task offloading purposes. Building on this foundation, a pioneering methodology for image processing task offloading was devised, leveraging fully connected neural network training. Evaluations conducted extensively indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms established benchmarks in terms of efficiency.

AB The GI tract can develop some medical issues that may require a doctor to evaluate them. These consist of growth anomalies, tissue inflammations, and gastrointestinal issues. In this work, we propose a novel deep-learning (DL) technique to classify the categories of Gastrointestinal Diseases from Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. It has five steps to evaluate. Initially, utilizing the mean filter to remove the noise from given input images. Then extract the features such as shape and position from wireless capsule endoscopy images using the DenseNet-121 technique. To select the features, we utilize the Enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (EWOA). Finally, to classify the eight classes of gastrointestinal diseases, we propose a SE-ResNet technique to classify the GI diseases into Ulcerative-colitis, Normal-cecum, Dyed-resection-margins, Esophagitis, Normal-pylorus, Dyed-lifted-polyps, Normal-z-line, Polyps categories with Bald Eagle Search optimization technique to get better accuracy of classification outcomes. In our experiments, we used the Kvasir v2 dataset, and the experiments performed well in terms of recall, precision, accuracy, and f1-score. The performance of the classification technique achieves 99.66% accuracy. The proposed method detects GI disorders on WCE images better than "state-of-the-art" methods while also classifying the items.

AB This study investigates the efficacy of tensor-based morphometry (TBM) in detecting Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using deep learning techniques. The primary focus is on discerning the volumetric variations in brain tissues characteristic of AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) conditions. TBM, as a measure of minute local volume differences, is employed as the distinguishing feature. The results are juxtaposed with those obtained from machine- learning-based methods, trained using a variety of medical images. Three unique models were developed for this purpose. The first model, trained using medial slices of the brain (train: 1622; test: 406), displayed an accuracy of less than 50%. The second model utilized axial brain slices procured at 5-pixel intervals, encompassing the hippocampus and the temporal lobe (train: 1632; test: 406), and demonstrated a significantly improved accuracy of 93%. The third model, fine-tuned with small kernel sizes to better extract localized changes from the image data used in the second model, achieved an accuracy of 92%. The findings suggest that the application of TBM and deep learning to medial slices alone is insufficient for an accurate diagnosis of AD. However, employing TBM with deep learning techniques to slices covering the hippocampus and temporal lobe can potentially offer a highly accurate approach for early AD detection. Notably, the use of small filters to extract detailed features from TBM did not enhance the model's performance. This research underscores the potential of deep learning in advancing the field of AD detection and diagnosis, providing crucial insights into the future development of diagnostic tools.

AB In the contemporary digital age, an intensified emphasis has been placed on the research of book recommendation systems. Historically, these systems predominantly focused on readers' past preferences, overlooking the inherent characteristics of the book's content and design. To address this gap, a novel algorithm, leveraging both multimodal image processing and deep learning, was designed. Features from book cover images were extracted using the VGG16 model, while textual attributes were discerned through a combination of the Word2Vec model and LSTM neural networks. The integration of the CBAM attention mechanism culminated in the creation of a modality-weighted feature fusion module, facilitating the dynamic allocation of feature weights. Furthermore, an objective function for this recommendation model was formulated, ensuring the enhancement of its performance during the training phase. This study not only presents a groundbreaking methodology to amplify the efficacy and resilience of book recommendation systems but also broadens understanding in the realm of multimodal information processing within deep learning-based recommendation platforms.

AB In the realm of Augmented Reality (AR) within mobile gaming, the planes recognized by depth sensors delineate the space for content implementation, thereby constraining the scope of representation. Errors in these recognized planes may inhibit the progression of mobile AR. A method is explored that utilizes 'Meshing' facilitated by Unity, generating meshes corresponding to physical space and enabling expansion of content space beyond mere planes. This approach, although promising, is contingent on the depth sensor, leading to the creation of holes beyond the sensor's reach. These holes present a critical issue, allowing game objects to escape. To address this challenge, an algorithm is proposed that consists of two main components: 'Hole-Finding' and 'Hole-Filling'. In 'Hole-Finding', real holes are identified by the calculation of the direction of each loop. Subsequently, 'Hole-Filling' computes the centroid-vertex of each hole and employs it for the hole-filling process. A real-time hole-filling performance with only a 7 mu sec degradation was observed, heralding a significant step towards mitigating this problem within AR content. This investigation contributes a novel solution to a crucial technical obstacle, thereby enhancing the functionality and potential of AR in mobile gaming.

AB Background: Sleep disorders pose significant health risks, necessitating accurate diagnostics. The analysis of polysomnographic data and subsequent sleep stage classification by medical professionals are crucial in diagnosing these disorders. The application of artificial intelligence (AI)-based systems for automated sleep stage classification has gained significant momentum recently. Methodology: In this study, we introduce a machine learning model designed for high-accuracy, automated sleep stage classification. We utilized a dataset consisting of polysomnographic data from 50 individuals, obtained from the Yozgat Bozok University Sleep Center. A variety of classifiers, including Extra Tree, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boost, were tested. Sleep stages were classified into three categories: Wakefulness (WK), Rapid Eye Movement (REM), and Non-Rapid Eye Movement (N-REM). Results: The overall classification accuracies were 95.4%, 95%, and 92% for three distinct classifiers, respectively, with the highest accuracy reaching 98.8%. Comparison with Existing Methods: This study distinguishes itself from comparable sleep stage-scoring research by utilizing a unique dataset, and by incorporating data from 16 channels, which contributes to the achieved accuracy. Conclusion: The machine learning model trained with a unique dataset demonstrated high classification success in the automated scoring of sleep stages. This research underscores the potential of machine learning techniques in improving sleep disorder diagnostics.

AB In addressing the digital and intelligent transformation challenges within the traditional desulfurization process of coal secondary utilization, a perception learning model rooted in semantic segmentation networks has been developed. This model, when integrated with real-world operational environments, is shown to confront issues arising from symmetry and multi-scale features inherent to thermal power distribution room contexts. A combination of multi-scale feature fusion and attention mechanisms has facilitated the precise detection of human-like operation knobs on switch operation panels. To cope with extended dynamic scenes, a method relying on the visual bag-of-words has been adopted, wherein local image features are extracted and matched against a visual dictionary, resulting in a refined visual representation. The subsequent selection of consecutive symmetrically similar scene keyframes and the elimination of superfluous data have been observed to augment the efficacy of loop-closure detection. Such enhancements have culminated in improved accuracy in the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) of mobile robots, enabling their autonomous navigation to designated switching operation task locations. Experimental findings underscore the superiority of this optimized model over traditional semantic segmentation networks, with its ability to pinpoint operation knobs on electrical control cabinet panels in distribution rooms. Moreover, before initiating grasping actions under the Eye-in-hand architecture, visual servo grasping maneuvers can be executed, irrespective of the target's appearance angle within the field of view. This optimization offers an insightful foundation for potential integrations into patrol operation mobile robots, marking a feasible and effective stride forward.

AB Cataracts, characterized by the opacification of the eye lens leading to visual deterioration, pose a significant global health issue. Timely and accurate detection of cataracts is pivotal for halting disease progression and augmenting the patients' quality of life. However, conventional diagnostic approaches for cataract detection and grading rely heavily on the expertise of ophthalmologists, a solution that can be unduly costly and inaccessible for certain population segments seeking early intervention. Addressing this challenge, the present study introduces a computer-assisted diagnostic strategy for the detection and grading of cataracts, drawing on fundus retinal images. The proposed approach capitalizes on a deep convolutional neural network to extract features from fundus images, which are subsequently evaluated via three distinct classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The resultant categorization stratifies the images into four severity levels: mild, moderate, normal, and severe. Further enhancing the classifier's prediction accuracy, an Ensemble (ES) learning mechanism via a Majority Voting Scheme (MVS) process is incorporated into the study. A total of 1600 fundus images, sourced from various open-access databases and classified into four categories by an expert ophthalmologist, were utilized for the study. The proposed methodology demonstrated a commendable accuracy rate of 97.34% in the four-stage cataract classification and grading, outperforming existing methodologies. This research advances the field by introducing a reliable, cost-effective, and accessible solution for early cataract detection, contributing significantly to global health improvements.

AB The automatic classification of ECG signals, also known as computer-based classification, has become critically important in the diagnostic landscape of E-health. This study presents an innovative approach that employs Gaussian Modeling to enhance the accuracy of Beat signal approximation prior to training and classification. Previous methodologies largely relied on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and were contingent on the quality of collected field data sets, which often contained numerous artifacts and noise. This study demonstrates that addressing and eliminating these issues before training can significantly improve classification outcomes. The performance of the proposed approach was rigorously evaluated through several classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDL), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These classifiers were applied to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, revealing a significant enhancement in results compared to conventional methods. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the Gaussian function in modeling ECG signals, improving the accuracy of various classifiers. Remarkable levels of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were achieved across classifiers, with some reaching an accuracy rate of 100%. Notably, the CNN classifier exhibited exceptional performance, demonstrating an accuracy rate of 99.65%, sensitivity of 99.64%, and specificity of 99.88%. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts in the E-health domain to improve diagnostic procedures through AI, offering a significant advancement in ECG signal classification.

However, traditional image processing techniques frequently neglect the inherent sequence-level characteristics during action recognition and fail to exploit the comprehensive full-field data when discerning rehabilitation training action standards. Addressing these limitations, a novel method was proposed. Initially, the GaitSet algorithm was employed to recognize the lower limb rehabilitation training actions, ensuring complete consideration of sequence-level features. Subsequently, leveraging the full-field optical flow tracking approach, challenges associated with discerning the standards of lower limb rehabilitation training actions were examined. It is anticipated that this novel methodology can offer an enhanced tool for evaluating the effectiveness of lower limb rehabilitation training in the realm of rehabilitation medicine. Such advancements could potentially contribute to optimizing rehabilitation outcomes and augmenting patients' quality of life.

AB The assurance of fruit freshness during harvest is an enduring challenge that is faced by farmers and suppliers. Traditional methodologies, currently utilized for evaluating fruit freshness, have been characterized by their time-consuming nature, high costs, labor-intensity, and susceptibility to inaccuracies. To address these issues, machine-based detection and sorting systems have been proposed, offering increased efficiency by leveraging technological advancements to analyze fruit attributes such as color, texture, physical appearance, size, and shape. These attributes are critical determinants of fruit quality and value, making accurate fruit evaluation a necessity in the agricultural and food industries. This is particularly true for products such as organic juices and jams, which have significant implications for human health. Providing unfit fruits not only affects the economy adversely but also contributes to augmented carbon dioxide emissions. This work presents a novel technical solution for the detection of pineapple freshness on Vietnamese farms, employing the Fast R-CNN and YOLOv5 techniques. The YOLO model was trained on a diverse dataset, comprised of over a hundred object categories and 50,000 preprocessed images. An aggregated model, combining the outputs of the pre-trained and transfer models, demonstrated improved performance while reducing training time, owing to the extensive training dataset. The classifier displayed an impressive accuracy sensitivity of 94.5% when tested on 50,000 images. Experimental results validate the superior performance of the trained YOLOv5s model, which attains a ripe pineapple recognition accuracy of 98%, outperforming Faster R-CNN by 9.27% and trailing behind YOLOv5x by a mere 0.22%. Additionally, the YOLOv5s model exhibits an impressive detection speed, requiring only 9.2ms to detect a single image-67.88% faster than Faster R-CNN and only 34.06% slower than YOLOv5x. These findings confirm that the YOLOv5s target recognition model meets the requirements for accurate recognition and high-speed processing of ripe pineapples. Its compatibility with agricultural-embedded mobile devices makes it a prime candidate for supporting precision operations in ripe pineapple harvesting machines.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an unprecedented surge in the proliferation of online E-learning platforms, designed to cater to a wide array of subjects across all age groups. However, a paucity of these platforms adopts a learner-centric approach or validates user learning, underscoring the need for effective E-learning validation and personalized learning recommendations. This paper addresses these challenges by implementing an innovative approach that leverages real-time electroencephalogram (EEG) signals collected from learners, who don neuro headsets while partaking in online courses. These EEG signals are subsequently classified using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning models, with the intent of discerning the efficacy of the E-learning process. The proposed models have yielded promising classification accuracies of 68% and 97% for the CNN and LSTM models, respectively, demonstrating their rapidity and precision in classifying E-learning EEG signals. Thus, these models hold substantial potential for application in similar E-learning validation scenarios. Furthermore, this study introduces an automated framework designed to track the learning curve of users and furnish valuable recommendations for E-learning materials. The presented approach, therefore, not only validates the E-learning process but also aids in optimizing the learning experiences on E-learning platforms.

AB With the rise in online shopping, the role of product images in shaping consumer purchase decisions has been accentuated. Despite burgeoning research in this domain, there remains a lacuna in comprehensively understanding the relationship between specific visual attributes, such as color and target shape, in product images and the consequent sales volume. To bridge this gap, the relationship between product image colors and sales volume on online platforms was examined, and color attributes from these images were systematically extracted. Furthermore, an exploration was undertaken into the association between the target shape of product images and sales volume. Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) features from these images were distilled, aiming to furnish a more precise market analysis. Through leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this study not only augments the academic comprehension of consumer behavior but also proffers strategic insights for online retail practitioners. The methodological approach ensures a targeted marketing direction and facilitates informed product design strategies.

AB The economic health of a nation is significantly influenced by the productivity of its agricultural sector. Enhancing this productivity is directly linked to the early detection and management of plant diseases. Automated classification methodologies are instrumental in the early diagnosis of these diseases, offering improved precision over traditional methods. These automated systems initiate disease detection as soon as symptoms begin to manifest on plant leaves, following a four-step process involving pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this study, we present an automated methodology for the detection and classification of plant diseases using a deep-learning approach applied to varying quality leaf images. A deep convolutional neural network architecture was trained utilizing an image dataset. The proposed Deep Neural Network Plant Disease Classifier (DNN-PDC) was specifically designed for the multi-categorization of plant diseases. Tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset on Kaggle were selected for the experiments. The proposed deep learning system demonstrated a high level of accuracy in the classification of various tomato leaf diseases, including Early Blight, Septoria Leaf Spot, and Late Blight. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method surpasses existing approaches in the image-based classification of tomato plant diseases. This study underscores the potential of the DNN-PDC model as a highly effective tool for plant disease detection and classification.

AB The role of machine learning in medical research, particularly in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, has proven to be significant. The current study delineates the design and refinement of an artificial intelligence (AI) framework tailored to differentiate COVID-19 from Pneumonia utilizing X-ray scans in synergy with textual clinical data. The focal point of this research is the amalgamation of diverse neural networks and the exploration of the impact of metaheuristic algorithms on optimizing these networks' weights. The proposed framework uniquely incorporates a lung segmentation process using a pre-trained ResNet34 model, generating a mask for each lung to mitigate the influence of potential extraneous features. The dataset comprised 579 segmented X-ray images (Anteroposterior and Posteroanterior views) of COVID-19 and Pneumonia patients, supplemented with each patient's textual medical data, including age and gender. An enhancement in accuracy from 94.32% to 97.85% was observed with the implementation of weight optimization in the proposed framework. The efficacy of the model in detecting COVID-19 was further ascertained through a comprehensive comparison with various architectures cited in the existing literature.

AB In the realm of geological and mineral exploration, remote sensing technology has emerged as a pivotal high-tech instrument. However, the effective interpretation of remote sensing images, especially in the context of heterogeneous data processing, noise, and the identification of fine granularity, remains a challenge. In this study, a novel method for the identification of mineral elements within remote sensing imagery was introduced. Firstly, a heterogeneous feature tensor migration technique anchored on the Coupled Heterogeneous Tucker Decomposition (CH-Tucker decomposition) was presented. Through this technique, multi-source remote sensing data were effectively processed and fused. Notably, associated data features from varying resolutions and angles were seamlessly coupled. Subsequently, an optical remote sensing image processing model founded on the RFDNet network was established. This model demonstrated robustness against noise data, thereby enabling the identification of mineral elements with a higher degree of granularity. The proposed methodology exhibited the capacity to extract mineral element information comprehensively and with remarkable accuracy. Thus, this research offers both valuable theoretical insights and practical evidence for furtherance in geological research and mineral element exploration.

AB Today, all kinds of institutions and organizations depend on the Internet and information systems. They have been an inseparable part of human life. This brings out not only convenience, but also potentially devastating vulnerabilities. There are countless solutions for such risks and it is true that these solutions greatly contribute to security, but no effective solution has yet been found against Zero-Day malware. Zero-day malware is malicious software that has not yet been identified by competent authorities and is not classified as malicious software. A traditional malware detection tool can only detect previously detected software and classify it as malicious. Machine learning methods, which have proven effective in various domains, offer a promising approach to addressing Zero-Day malware. Throughout this study, a stable solution other than traditional methods have been investigated to overcome all kinds of malware. Instead of solutions consisting of complex, time-consuming and heterogeneous features (such as deleting/adding/changing files, monitoring registry records, or running processes) in various studies in the literature, a simple, low-time cost and stable solution with homogeneous features (only API calls) has been obtained. The 98.04% accuracy score shows that the method is quite successful. The importance of the study is having high accuracy using only API calls as features in malware detection. It has been realized that classical antivirus methods are no longer sufficient for combating malicious software.

AB Dynamic channel modelling allows communication interfaces to integrate continuous learning operations for incremental BER reductions. These models scan temporal BER patterns, and then tune internal-channel parameters in order to improving communication efficiency under real-time traffic scenarios. But these models showcase high complexity, thus cannot be scaled to large-scale network deployments. Moreover, these models are not flexible, and do not support denser channel models, which restricts their applicability under real-time scenarios. To overcome these issues, this text proposes design of a novel dynamic learning method for improved channel modelling in Phased array antennas mm Wave radios via temporal breakpoint analysis. The model initially collects information about channel BER and uses a Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) technique to improve its internal model parameters. These parameters are further tuned via a novel breakpoint model, which enables for continuous and light-weighted tuning of channel modelling parameters. This allows the model to incrementally reduce BER even under denser noise levels. The model is further cascaded with a Q-Learning based optimization process, which assists in improving channel modelling efficiency for large-scale networks. Due to these integrations, the model is capable of reducing Bit Error Rate (BER) by 8.3% when compared with standard channel modelling techniques that use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Sparse Bayesian Learning, etc. These methods were selected for comparison due to their higher efficiency and scalability when applied to real-time communication scenarios. The model also showcased 6.5% lower computational delay due to linear processing operations. It was able to achieve 10.4% better channel coverage, 8.5% higher throughput, and 4.9% higher channel estimation accuracy, which makes it useful for a wide variety of real-time network deployments.

AB In nursery gardens, seedlings are traditionally densely planted, leading to large errors and questionable accuracy when employing standard sampling and probability statistical methods. Such conventional methods also prove labor-intensive. To address these challenges, a patrol platform equipped with a drone-mounted image acquisition system was developed. Remote sensing images, sourced from a nursery garden situated in the Linjiang Forestry Bureau of Jilin Province, China, served as the primary dataset. By leveraging the deep learning-based target detection capabilities of the YOLOv4 algorithm, seedlings within the nursery garden were meticulously surveyed, delineated, and enumerated. For the statistical evaluation of Pinus Koraiensis (Korean pine) seedlings, a precision of 91.85% was achieved using the YOLOv4 algorithm. Results suggest a notable robustness of the model in standard environments. Compared to traditional quadrat sampling and detection approaches, the methodology introduced here offers an intelligent, efficient, and precise mapping strategy for large-scale seedling surveys.

AB Diseases affecting the Oryza Sativa (rice) plant result in substantial agricultural losses, leading to a decline in crop productivity by up to 25% and posing a significant threat to global food security. Hence, the rapid and accurate diagnosis of such diseases is paramount to ensure effective treatment and to enhance overall plant health. This has led to an increased interest among plant pathologists in developing reliable methods for identifying diseases in Oryza Sativa crops. In this study, an innovative disease classification model for the Oryza Sativa plant is proposed, leveraging the Optimal Adaptive Boosting Cascade Classifier (OABCC) and the efficient-artificial fish swarm optimization (EAFSO). A weighted image fusion technique is utilized in the pre-processing stage for image denoising, combining the outcomes of homomorphic filtering (HAF), Laplace filtering (LAF), and the Kuwahara Filter (KF). The diseased portions of the Oryza Sativa plant leaf are localized using the OABCC, while Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (SN-MS) is deployed to select the optimal detection box for each item. The LeNet model, bolstered with an atrous-convolution layer, is integrated into the OABCC for improved disease classification. Further enhancement in model accuracy is achieved through the application of the EAFSO optimization strategy. When applied to the OABCC-ATRLeNet model for rice disease classification, the EAFSO optimization strategy outperforms other strategies such as WSSO, CSO, AFSO, and PSO. This research underscores the potential of deep learning approaches for robust and accurate classification of plant diseases, contributing significantly to the efforts in securing global food resources.

ID DENTAL AGE; TOOTH ERUPTION
AB Forensic odontology, recognized as a fundamental and reliable technique in human identification, frequently employs orthopantomograph images in dental biometry. Despite the introduction of various techniques for age and identity estimation, the accurate and rapid interpretation of these images remains challenging. Manual methods, currently employed by forensic experts, present numerous limitations including time consumption, human error, and challenges in handling large data sets. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a computer-aided hybrid age detection system, Age-Net, leveraging artificial intelligence. A total of 933 orthopantomograph images, categorized into three classes, were collected from Firat University Hospital for this study. These images were subsequently resized to be compatible with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models, such as AlexNet, ResNet50, VGG16, SqueezeNet, EfficientNetB0, DenseNet201, and ResNet18. Following the extraction of feature vectors from these images, algorithms including Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), XGBoost Algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Linear Discriminant (LD) were implemented for detection. The use of an array of feature extraction models and algorithms aimed to best represent the features of the dataset, thereby enhancing classification performance. The proposed system's efficacy was assessed and validated using the 5-fold cross-validation test technique and statistical Friedman test. Of all models, the EfficientNetB0-SVM hybrid model demonstrated superior performance, achieving highest accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F-score, and AUC ratios of 0.846, 0.850, 0.846, 0.846, and 0.970, respectively. This hybrid detection system, Age-Net, is projected to provide time and cost benefits to forensic experts in their clinical studies. However, the data utilized in this study are limited to specific age groups. Future research could expand the number of age groups and data to observe potential enhancements in the system's success rate.

AB In coal mining environments, both complexity and potential hazards are inherently present. Responding to the critical need for improved coal mine safety, a method was developed for the real-time surveillance of these hazards using an adapted YOLO algorithm. Initially, an algorithm, which amalgamates attention mechanisms and multi-feature fusion for the detection of safety hazards in coal mines, was presented. Utilizing the YOLOv3 framework, the Gc Net attention module was integrated, a reverse feature fusion pathway was established, and a three-scale prediction module was constructed. Such modifications were designed to identify hazards of various dimensions and configurations, thus augmenting the approach's robustness in intricate situations. Further, the model's loss function underwent optimization to address the imbalances observed in the distribution of positive and negative samples concerning their numbers and complexities. Through experimentation, the efficacy of the proposed method was demonstrated.

AB This study presents a novel methodology for robust classification of image quality, a critical task in the domain of computer vision. The ability to accurately and promptly classify an image as being of inferior quality, due to factors such as lighting, focus, encoding, and compression, is crucial for a wide range of applications, including autonomous vehicles, web search technologies, smartphones, and digital cameras. Moreover, this capability holds significant potential for numerous industrial applications, particularly in the realm of quality assurance in manufacturing processes or outgoing inspections. In response to this requirement, a novel automated system is proposed herein, employing an optimization algorithm to categorize images into six distinct classes: motion blur, white noise, Gaussian blur, poor illumination, JPEG 2000, and high-quality reference images. The proposed framework is evaluated against existing methodologies using a selection of publicly available datasets. Both subjective and objective assessment results will be presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. This work underscores the potential of leveraging optimized deep learning techniques for robust and automatic image quality classification, thereby paving the way for improved quality assurance across diverse industries.

ID ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION
AB Early and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial in the medical field, as undetected or misdiagnosed tumors can lead to sudden death. Traditional models for diagnosing brain tumors suffer from low Time of Conversion (ToC) and low accuracy, contributing to a high mortality rate among the 5 million people affected by brain disease annually, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Previous methods, such as Elastic Net Regression (ENR), Logistic Regression (LR), and other machine learning models, struggle to accurately locate and identify brain lesions. Moreover, these models are not suited for cloud-based platforms. To address this issue, we developed a sophisticated, cloud-based brain abnormality detection application using the LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the DriveHQ platform. The pre-trained LeNet-5 model extracts features from ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and MIRIAD datasets. Real-time MRI brain images were collected from Manipal Hospital in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India. The LeNet-5 model employs hidden layers, flattened layers, max-pooling layers, dense layers, and ReLu layers for optimal performance. Our 2D-LeNet-5 CNN approach preprocesses images using split and merge techniques of binary mask segmentation. The Python 3.7 software tool was used to train and test datasets to identify abnormalities in MRI brain images. The proposed application achieved remarkable performance metrics, including 99.65% accuracy, 99.59% sensitivity, 99.72% F1-score, 99.25% recall, 59.32 PSNR, and 0.9929 MCC. These results demonstrate the superiority of our methodology in comparison to existing models, making it a promising solution for cloud-based brain tumor diagnosis and recognition.

AB Over extended periods, nature's forces have sculpted and solidified unique cave formations. The scientific community's increasing interest in studying these karst caves has highlighted the significance of advanced detection methods. Sonar caving, a prevalent technique, still grapples with comprehensive detection within these intricate structures. This study delves into the amalgamation of target location and image fusion algorithms to bridge this gap. Target location elucidates an object's position, dimensions, and intrinsic characteristics within a designated temporal and spatial domain. Image fusion, a leading topic within image processing, leverages the consolidation of diverse data types and formats, thereby playing a pivotal role in image enhancement, compression, and recognition. From a deep learning perspective, neural network output values were calculated, facilitating an improvement in positioning accuracy. Further, through matrix decomposition and wavelet transforms, the fusion efficacy was scrutinized, aiming to broaden the sonar detection ambit. Comparative experimentation underscored the efficacy of integrating these two algorithms in sonar-based karst cave detection. It was observed that not only did the image clarity amplify, but there was also a notable 7.93% augmentation in positioning accuracy and a surge in detection speed. Cumulatively, a 7.64% boost in the overall efficiency of sonar detection in karst caves was achieved, underscoring the imperative nature of these technological advancements for cave surveillance.

AB The healing trajectory of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is commonly determined through manual inspection, a method which is often subjective and prone to errors. In an effort to address these limitations, this study explores an artificial intelligence-based, computer-aided assessment technique as an alternative. This approach leverages the power of a Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)-based image fusion technique, integrating thermal and visual data to deliver precise wound characterizations. Further, through the deployment of an instance segmentation-based Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN), the area of the wound is estimated. This randomized, prospective, single-blind study was conducted over a 12-week period, focusing on neuropathic DFUs (Wagner grade 2) located on the plantar aspect of the foot. Forty-two patients were enrolled, with an average age of 54.28 +/- 7.45 years and an average ulcer duration of 5.86 +/- 2.22 years. The healing trajectory of eight patients, observed weekly, was further analyzed. The absolute temperature difference (ATD) between contralateral ulcer regions was found to be 2.63 +/- 1.99 degrees C, with the respective z-score values of ATD providing a significant p-value of 0.000040412 (i.e., p<0.05). The correlation between the ground truth (ulcer area estimation by clinicians using Woundly software) and the proposed method was found to be at an average of 92.50%. The study ultimately concludes that the Mask-RCNN technique, when applied to fused images, can facilitate automated and user-independent assessments of DFUs. This method has the potential to aid in the accurate characterization of healing trajectories, thereby enhancing the overall understanding of wound progression in diabetic patients.

AB Facial expressions are one of the communication ways between humans and their behavior can be determined through their facial expressions. Recently computer technology has been used to identify the facial expressions of people in order to predict their intentions. It remains a challenge for facial expression recognition to extract discriminative features from training sets with few labels because most deep learning-based algorithms primarily rely on spatial information and large labels. In this paper, we propose a system to classify seven types of facial expressions (Angry, Sadness, Surprise, Happiness, Fear, Neutral, and Disgust) instead of six, as in most previous research. In the proposed system, machine learning algorithms with deep learning are used to increase classification accuracy based on removing some unimportant facial regions. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is trained to detect the eyes and mouth regions from the face depending on histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) which is used as a features extractor. Then, merge the eyes and mouth regions for each image to create a new form of an image. After that, five different types of images are generated from the merged image named (RGB, HSV, Gray, Binary, and YCbCr). The images are fed one by one into the convolution neural network (CNN) algorithm. Finally, the voting process is used to select the most predictive class. The proposed system has been tested on three different types of datasets (KDEF, JAFFE, and FER2013) and the prediction accuracy in the system has reached more than 98% in all used datasets. The conclusion is that eliminating unimportant regions impacts the results of the classification accuracy.

AB As image segmentation tasks become increasingly intricate within high-dimensional data flow environments, conventional segmentation techniques are challenged in delivering both efficiency and precision. In this context, the problem of image segmentation under high-dimensional data flux was examined. Depth skip connections, inspired by the U-Net architecture, were introduced, harnessing the superior feature extraction capabilities of deep encoders and enabling the formulation of a lightweight model structure. Furthermore, an equilibrium between Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss and Dice loss was established, targeting enhanced accuracy in small object segmentation tasks within such data-intensive settings. These innovations not only augment algorithmic accuracy and resilience but also provide pivotal contributions to ongoing research in the image segmentation realm. The methodologies delineated herein present a refined approach to image segmentation, revealing significant potential for application in pivotal sectors, including medical image analysis and autonomous vehicular navigation.

AB The classification of an individual as male or female is a significant issue with several practical implications. In recent years, automatic gender identification has garnered considerable interest because of its potential applications in e-commerce and the accumulation of demographic data. Recent observations indicate that models based on deep learning have attained remarkable success in a variety of problem domains. In this study, our aim is to establish an end-to-end model that capitalizes on the strengths of competing convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (ViT) models. To accomplish this, we propose a novel approach that combines the MobileNetV2 model, which is recognized for having fewer parameters than other CNN models, with the ViT model. Through rigorous evaluations, we have compared our proposed model with other recent studies using the accuracy metric. Our model attained state-of-the-art performance with a remarkable score of 96.66% on the EarVN1.0 dataset, yielding impressive results. In addition, we provide t-SNE results that demonstrate our model's superior learning representation. Notably, the results show a more effective disentanglement of classes.

AB Glaucoma, a major ocular disease, often culminates in irreversible blindness if undiagnosed. Characterized by optic nerve fiber degeneration, it instigates structural changes to the optic nerve, thus precipitating vision loss. Despite being symptomless, early detection is imperative to prevent further visual impairment. The disease's inception is attributed to increased intraocular pressure, a condition influenced by blood pressure. Notably, the eye and heart share parallel characteristics, making glaucoma an early indicator of potential cardiac conditions. Increased blood pressure frequently accompanies Diabetes mellitus - a common complication exacerbating cardiac health and fostering the development of cardiovascular diseases. Leveraging computational technologies allows for the early-stage identification of glaucoma. The utilization of deep learning approaches and pruning techniques has yielded significant outcomes in detecting glaucoma-related abnormalities accurately. Pruning, a strategy implemented to eliminate redundant parameters while preserving optimal performance, is particularly beneficial. This study introduces a Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) incorporating wavelet transformation for the detection of glaucoma, thereby assisting in diabetes and heart disease risk identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the GONN method outperforms conventional methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron, ensemble methods, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and decision trees. Notably, the GONN technique achieves an impressive accuracy of 95%, an F1 score of 92%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 98.92%. This study's findings underscore the potential of the GONN technique in accurately identifying glaucoma, thereby aiding in early diabetes and heart disease risk prediction. The results demonstrate that the GONN approach is a viable tool for clinical practice, with potential implications for improved patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

AB Human security screening constitutes a vital component in public safety assurance across varied environments like airports, governmental edifices, and additional public spaces. Among the paramount challenges inherent in human security screening lies the immediate and precise discernment of prospective threats within X-ray images. Despite the potential exhibited by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image recognition tasks, including the detection of targets in X-ray imagery, the substantial computational burden and memory prerequisites often render real-time deployment impracticable on devices with limited resources. In the present study, a novel lightweight CNN approach, melding Yolov5s and GhostNet models with the coordinate attention mechanism, is introduced to alleviate the constraints found in existing techniques. By employing this combination, efficiency in computation and model accuracy has been augmented, thereby addressing the challenges of swift and accurate threat identification. Performance evaluation, conducted on a publicly accessible dataset comprising X-ray images pertinent to human security screening, demonstrated the superior detection accuracy and reduced storage footprint of the proposed model in comparison to prevailing alternatives. Overall, the approach delineated herein presents an efficacious and streamlined solution for real-time human security screening image recognition on resource-constrained devices, contributing a promising advancement in the field.

AB In recent years, advancements in deep learning have fostered the development of sophisticated object detectors, specifically in the realm of computer vision. The inherent complexity of images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents a multitude of challenges for object detection. These include, but are not limited to, the detection of small and densely clustered objects, scale variance, occluded objects, and intricate backgrounds, which are particularly prevalent in drone-captured imagery when compared to natural scenes with larger and more distinct objects. The current landscape of object detection research has seen a surge in interest surrounding advanced, anchor-free object detectors, attention mechanisms, and the use of transformers as an alternative to convolutional neural networks. In light of these developments, this study introduces a novel object detection framework that eschews anchor utilization and leverages a transformer backbone for feature extraction. A cardinal grouping-based split attention module is integrated into this network to selectively extract the most pertinent features. The object detection head, termed the Pyramid Vision Split Attention Module Network (PvSAMNet), comprises three branches: classification, confidence, and regression, which collaboratively facilitate the final object detection from drone images. Additionally, an Intersection over Union (IoU) balanced loss function is employed to effectively equilibrate the classification and localization steps. The performance of the proposed detector is evaluated using the Visdrone-DET dataset, with the efficacy gauged by the average precision (AP) and average recall (AR) metrics. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other detector models with an average precision of 38.74. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse in the field of object detection, providing a novel framework that addresses the unique complexities of UAV imagery and demonstrates promising results in comparative evaluations.

AB The rapid progression of diseases in the elderly, such as Alzheimer's Dementia (AD), necessitates effective early detection mechanisms to ensure appropriate healthcare provision. Given the consistently increasing prevalence of AD, the potential for emerging socio-economic challenges is significant. This underlines the importance of developing early detection strategies to mitigate the progression of this disease. Electroencephalograms (EEG) present a promising avenue for the early diagnosis of AD. EEG signals harbor crucial information pertaining to neuronal death triggered by amyloid plaque accumulation, a characteristic feature of AD. Spectral analysis reveals a deceleration in signal activity in AD patients when compared to healthy elderly individuals. However, this method is frequently compromised by low-frequency noise, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches for analyzing EEG signal features for early AD detection. Considering the complex nature of EEG signals, it is hypothesized that pathological conditions, such as AD, may induce alterations in signal complexity. In this study, an early detection model for AD was simulated utilizing an approach that focused on EEG signal complexity. Complexity analysis, incorporating Spectral Entropy (SpecEn) and fractal dimensions, was calculated across 19 EEG channels from a total of 34 subjects (16 normal and 18 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)). Performance validation of the proposed method was achieved through Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), yielding an accuracy of 82.4%, specificity of 77.8%, and sensitivity of 87.5%. The findings from this study suggest that EEG analysis can serve as a reliable tool for the early detection of AD.

AB Positron Emission Tomography (PET) holds substantial promise in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Nonetheless, PET imaging's constraints, typified by deficient sampling and considerable noise interference, often result in the production of inferior quality reconstructed images. These shortcomings can potentially undermine the clinical utility of the modality. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel image reconstruction algorithm underpinned by Bayesian theory that incorporates the total variation model and the median root prior (MRP) algorithm. The iterative resolution process of the algorithm comprises two stages. Initially, the MRP algorithm is employed for image reconstruction. Subsequently, the total variation model is applied to attenuate noise within the reconstructed image. Simulation outcomes reveal that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates Poisson noise while preserving critical image details, such as edges. When contrasted with traditional reconstruction algorithms, the proposed approach enhances both the precision and reliability of PET imaging markedly. Thus, the algorithm carries significant potential for clinical application and could substantially improve the quality of PET imaging.

AB The sudden appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic as a major health threat is a serious concern for global health professionals. The world's most pressing problem has now been revealed to be a deadly virus. Because of the limited supply of test kits and the need to screen and diagnose patients quickly, a self-operating detection strategy is required for the detection of COVID-19 infections and disorders. SARS-CoV-2 can be adequately screened to lessen the impact on healthcare systems. Models that incorporate a multitude of factors can predict the likelihood of infection. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) use a full-resolution Convolutional network to partition the effected region for easier identification and classification. Use of an existing patient dataset with trained and tested samples for recognition, segmentation and classification is used to evaluate the proposed model. For clinicians worldwide, especially those in countries with little resources in the healthcare sector, new technologies are being developed. Computer Tomography (CT) testing results can be improved by using larger datasets from outside the field. There is a considerable possibility that CT scan interpretation could benefit from knowledge gained from out-of-the-field training. In order to accurately classify and predict COVID-19 from CT scans, an effective Interconnected Antecedence Clustering Model employing DCNN (IACM-DCNN) is proposed in this research. There are a number of datasets taken into account by the proposed model, including https://andrewmvd.kaggle.com/datasets and https://mosmed.ai/datasets and https://github.com/UCSDAI4H/COVID-CT/tree/master. When compared to current models, the proposed model's detection accuracy is better.

AB The accessory spleen, a condition affecting a subset of the population, often presents diagnostic challenges due to its potential for being mistaken for a tumor or cyst. This underscores the importance of accurate identification of the accessory spleen. In this study, the development of a patch-based hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for the automatic detection of the accessory spleen is presented. The proposed model applies a five-step process in the detection of the accessory spleen, encompassing the extraction of the potential accessory spleen region, extraction of features from this region, selection of consistent and significant features, integration of these features, and their subsequent classification. Specialist physicians were responsible for the extraction of the region of interest. For feature extraction, four distinct CNN architectures were employed (AlexNet, Vgg16, MobileNet, Resnet50), and the feature vectors derived from these architectures were integrated. The Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) and ReliefF algorithms were utilized for the selection of the most representative features, which were subsequently classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The study revealed that the highest performance was achieved through the combination of SVM and ReliefF, yielding an accuracy of 93.87% (evaluated via 10-fold crossvalidation). The findings suggest that the proposed model could offer valuable decision support for physicians in the preliminary identification of the accessory spleen during clinical evaluations of tumors and similar structures resembling the accessory spleen.

AB The capacity of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is significantly enhanced through the use of abundant antennas at the base station (BS), supporting a multitude of users. However, in Time Division Duplex (TDD) mode, the multiplexing of pilots inevitably leads to Pilot Contamination (PC). In this study, a novel approach to interference alignment and pilot purification in a large MIMO system was proposed, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing and deep learning. The primary aim of the Compressive Sensing-Based Location Scheduling System (CSLSS) is to mitigate PC issues while optimizing the pilot sequence for the user. By introducing an additional sequence, the pilot set is enhanced using our location-based decontamination technique. Furthermore, a Feed-Forward Convolutional Neural Network (FFCNN) is employed for interference alignment in the MIMO system. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in the parameters under consideration. The sum rate showed an increase of 74.6%, the Bit Error Rate (BER) improved by 57.8%, the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) rose by 79.8%, and the spectral efficiency of the channel improved by 98% in terms of interference alignment. In addition, a compressive sensing-based parameter showed an enhancement of 98%. The Mean Square Error (MSE) for CSLSS was reduced by 64.5% for the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and the BER for the proposed compressive sensing method improved by 41.2% for SNR. The throughput also improved, with an increase of 97.5% for SNR and 97.8% for the number of antennas used in the BS.

AB Brain tumors, the second leading cause of mortality as identified by numerous health agencies, constitute a significant health challenge. Given the integral role of the brain in governing essential functionalities, such as memory, vision, learning, and problem-solving, early detection of malignant brain tumors is critical for effective medical intervention. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), demonstrating superior precision and reliability over Computed Tomography (CT), is a preferred modality for brain cancer identification. This study introduces an innovative approach to brain tumor detection and segmentation, utilizing fragmentation. Fragmentation, a promising method for brain cancer analysis, involves the differentiation of cancerous tissue from other brain components, such as fatty tissue, edema, normal brain matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. The critical role of denoising in this process, which entails iterative thresholding until the tumor is appropriately segregated, is examined. Further, the use of image classification for distinguishing abnormal regions indicative of a brain tumor in MRI scans is outlined. The proposed Multilevel De-noising model with Precision Edge-based Fragmentation for Tumor Size Diagnosis (MD-PES-TSD) is presented as a comprehensive framework for the detection and segmentation of MRI images. The MD-PES-TSD model is designed to effectively reduce image noise, identify structural brain edges, differentiate between abnormal and normal brain regions, and ultimately determine the size of the tumor. An evaluation of MRI data scans segregated into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) regions, following the implementation of early-stage denoising in the pre-processing phase and feature extraction through segmentation, is conducted. The MD- PES-TSD model is shown to outperform existing models in comparative analysis, signifying its potential as an effective solution for brain tumor detection and segmentation.

AB In the context of Industry 4.0, a transformative shift in industrial manufacturing, product enhancement, and distribution methods has been observed, emphasizing the critical need for precise recognition of human intention to ensure operational reliability, safety, and efficiency. Central to this recognition, especially in equipment manufacturing, is the accurate identification of tools manipulated by human operators. In this study, a novel object detection model, referred to as 'Industry-RetinaNet', has been proposed for advanced tool detection. Improvements upon the conventional RetinaNet are evident in the form of optimized anchor box shapes derived from advanced anchor generation techniques, an augmented number of detection boxes, and the reinforcement of an alternate backbone architecture. When validated against a test dataset, the model demonstrated notable performance metrics with an F1-score of 0.904, an mAP of 0.903, and a recall of 0.809, while preserving real-time processing capabilities. It is anticipated that the implementation of this methodology will pave the way for improved interpretation of worker intentions, potentially enhancing overall efficiency in the burgeoning arena of intelligent factories.

AB Fossil fuels are diminishing at an alarming rate in today's generation. The usage of renewable energy sources has emerged as the plan most likely to succeed in the long term. As a result, renewable energy supplies are being encouraged owing to their eco-friendliness, inexhaustibility, cheap cost, dependability, and resilience. The amount of the negative impact on the functioning of electrical networks caused by this change is proportional to the capacity of the particular station. Accurate forecasting of solar photovoltaic power on a minute-by-minute basis is beneficial to the functioning of the energy market, consumption of solar photovoltaic power, and power system stability. In this study, a CNN classifier (AlexNet) is proposed to classify the images of sun. The PSO based segmentation method is used to defog the sun image. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated for different architecture of CNN. For this we comparing proposed AlexNet to the other two models (VGGNet, GoogLeNet) to know the accuracy of our proposed model. To evaluate the accuracy performance metrics is used.

AB The inherent curvature in palm lines can pose challenges for palmprint recognition, particularly at lower resolutions where wrinkles become indistinguishable, leading to performance degradation. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel methodology employing curvi-linear anisotropic Gaussian filter-based Combined Differential Concavity and Infirmity (CDCI) codes. The use of curved filters has been proposed to represent curved palm lines more accurately, while anisotropic filtering is expected to enhance the extraction of blurred palm lines. The new representation, grounded in curvi-linear anisotropic Gaussian filtering, is posited to improve the recognition system's performance by effectively addressing these challenges. The proposed approach's effectiveness has been tested using the touchless IITD database and the contact-based PolyU 2D database. The experimental results suggest that the proposed methodology surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art coding-based procedures in palmprint recognition with the improvement of 3.82% and 36.36% in recognition rate and equal error rate.

AB Mammary tumors are commonly found in domestic animals and significantly affect animal health. In this context, the analysis of mammary tumor cells in domestic animals is crucial for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of cancer. These tumors can also lead to the death of animals. Therefore, academic studies are needed to prevent and early diagnose mammary cancer in animals. In this study, an artificial intelligence-supported system for early diagnosis of whether mammary tumor sections taken from domestic dogs will cause cancer was developed. The proposed system consists of image processing and classification stages. The data for the study was provided by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Burdur Mehmet Akif Ersoy University. In the image processing stage, various data preprocessing techniques and deep learning-based convolutional neural networks were used. Then, benign and malignant mammary tumors were classified to diagnose cancer. Data preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation, normalization and image filtering techniques were used to improve the performance of the deep learning-based image processing algorithm. The Xception model achieved a 98.9% success rate in tumor diagnosis. The study is believed to have made a significant contribution to the literature by using current methods and having a unique data set.

AB In this study, we propose a Second Order Shearlets (SOS) based system for Oral Cancer Classification (OCC) that leverages histopathological images. The fundamental premise of the system is the observable variations in texture patterns between normal and abnormal cells within these images, which can be exploited for differentiation. The images undergo a transformation from the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space to the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space, followed by the extraction of co-occurrence texture features via the SOS system. Further enhancement of feature extraction is achieved by applying a median filter for de-noising the histopathological images. The proposed SOS-OCC system, equipped with a probabilistic classifier at the final stage, was presented with an assortment of 1224 images for evaluation. The results indicated a noteworthy classification accuracy of 98.6% when employing stratified k-fold cross-validation, thereby underlining the system's efficacy in identifying oral cancer-related abnormalities. Moreover, a comparative analysis was conducted with Wavelet, Curvelet, and Contourlet-based representation systems to underscore the superior performance of the SOS-OCC system. This study provides valuable insights into the application of the SOS approach to oral cancer classification and sets a promising precedent for future research.

AB Waste is a significant problem that is around us. The problem occurs because waste volume speed could be faster. This problem can be solved by implementing machine learning in the waste sorting process based on two categories which are organic and inorganic. Knowing the most efficient image processing and classification machine learning model is necessary. This research uses the Support Vector Machine classification model hybridized with the Convolutional Neural Network, image processing morphology, and the HSV color model. The dataset is collected from the images available on the Kaggle website and executed using Python. The data used amounted to 25,077 with a training and test data ratio of 85:15. The data is processed using the proposed method, namely the morphology and HSV color model, to determine the performance between using the image process and those that do not. The data that has been processed is classified using the SVM-CNN Hybrid classification model. The performance results are an accuracy rate of 99.34% and a loss of 1.67% without overfitting.

This research focuses on water environment monitoring in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, employing advanced remote sensing and image processing methodologies. A technique was developed to extract the spatial location features of water bodies using remote sensing image segmentation. In addition, a novel spectral feature extraction technique predicated on a double inverse Gaussian model was introduced. This innovative method adeptly captures the contours of absorption peaks, facilitating the expression and extraction of spectral characteristics inherent to the water bodies. These methodologies were primarily designed to offer both theoretical and technical insights into the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the water environment. The outcomes of this study are comprehensively examined, with potential enhancements and prospective trends in water environment monitoring elucidated.

DE Image dehazing; Unsupervised deep learning; Domain adaptation;
   Disentangled representation
AB Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress of learning-based methods in single image dehazing. Among them, dehazing methods trained on the synthetic images cannot adapt to real hazy ones due to the domain gap, and domain adaptation methods only concentrate on creating a mapping or extracting shared features regardless of representations of deep features. In this paper, we propose an innovative cross-domain dehazing architecture that integrates domain adaptation and disentangled representation. Specifically, we first construct a shared encoder to map synthetic and real hazy images to a latent space and narrow their domain gap at the feature level. Then we utilize a separator to separate the hazy image features into haze-free representations and haze ones. We introduce feature consistency loss and orthogonal loss to further guide the disentanglement process. And then, we utilize a decoder to produce clean images from haze-free features and introduce both supervised and unsupervised losses to guide the training process. Moreover, we also propose to reconstruct the images from both domains by recombining the separated features, which guarantees information completeness. Experiments demonstrate that our method is on par with state-of-the-art methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/lixiao peng123456/DADRnet. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) hold great promise for improving transportation safety and efficiency. However, the development of these technologies requires a robust and systematic engineering process to ensure their reliable and safe operation in various traffic situations. In this letter, we present a scenario-based systems engineering for the development and test of advanced driver assistance systems, drawing insights from a real automotive proving ground. This letter is the second part of Decentralized and Hybrid Workshop (DHW) on Scenarios Engineering (SE), which aims to improve scenario diversity and representation for advanced driver assistance systems. The article proposes a 5-layer scenario architecture and also describes several key tasks that must be addressed in the ADAS, such as lane keeping assistance (LSK), adaptive cruise control (ACC) and autonomous emergency braking (AEB). Additionally, we elaborate on the testing challenges that the aforementioned tasks entail. Finally, we employ clustering methods to obtain 9 crucial scenarios of LKA, which can be utilized for ADAS testing.

AB This letter is the second report from a series of IEEE TIV's Decentralized and Hybrid Workshops (DHWs) on Intelligent Vehicles for Education (IV4E). It outlines the prospect of The Autonomous One (TAO), a future autonomous racing competition modeled after Formula One to advance IV4E by pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. Existing autonomous races face challenges, including compromised fairness and low participant enthusiasm. These issues limit spectator engagement, thereby reducing the races' educational value. To prevent similar flaws in organizing TAO, our focus lies in setting governance rules from an organizer's perspective. In these DHWs, we analyzed the rules of existing autonomous races and suggested rule-making guidelines for TAO. To improve fairness, we recommend a balanced scoring system with rigorous monitoring of participating teams' performances. To discourage consistent victories by a single team, we suggest that leading teams share their source codes, thereby setting the championship-level performance as the baseline in the next season and accelerating the evolution of all participating teams' abilities. For enhancing suspense and spectator interest, an on-site adaptive rewarding scheme should be deployed to create thrilling turnarounds. Our strategies aim to maintain fairness, increase spectator interest, inspire competitiveness, and ultimately contribute to the advancement of IV4E in organizing TAO.

AB This article is focused on bibliographic analysis and collaboration pattern analysis of the textpapers published in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles (TIV) from January 2019 to January 2023. We have identified the authors, institutions, and countries/regions that are the most productive and have the highest impact. It is found that research on intelligent vehicles is dominated by researchers and institutions from China. Researchers from the US are the second largest contributor to the transaction, whilst those from Germany rank the third. It is also found that, Fei-Yue Wang, Mohan Manubhai Trivedi, and J. Christian Gerdes are the three most productive and influential authors at IEEE TIV, and the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National University of Defense Technology, and the University of California, are three most productive and influential institutions. In addition, three networks are generated (i.e., the co-authorship, co-keyword, and author-keyword) to mine collaboration patterns among authors and keywords. Collaboration relationship between researchers and hot research topics are also investigated. Furthermore, an open-source tool is developed to automatically collect metadata, perform bibliographic analysis, and mine collaboration patterns.

AB Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) is one of the key issues in the field of autonomous driving. In recent years, more researchers have tried applying Deep Learning methods and techniques to VTP tasks. However, due to the black-box nature of Deep Learning, it cannot meet the interpretability and safety requirements of autonomous driving systems. Researchers have tried alleviating this problem by introducing driving knowledge in Deep Learning-based VTP. From the perspective of introducing driving knowledge, this paper systematically investigates the research status of DL-based VTP. First of all, this paper summarizes the research on VTP under three different problem formulations; secondly, this paper summarizes the application methods and application stages of driving knowledge in DL-based VTP; finally, this paper investigates and analyzes the VTP datasets and evaluation, and summarizes the knowledge contained in the datasets and its usage. Through the investigation and summary of problem formulation, knowledge usage, datasets, and evaluation of DL-based VTP, this paper analyzes the challenges and open questions of existing VTP research. It puts forward an outlook on future research directions.

AB Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) utilizing millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars is widely recognized as an essential component for autonomous driving applications. In this article, we present a Reconfigurable Holographic Surface (RHS)-aided SLAM system, incorporating federated learning. The hardware cost of autonomous driving systems can be significantly reduced by replacing the expensive phased array antennas, traditionally used in mmWave radars, with the low-cost RHS metasurface antenna. Furthermore, multiple vehicles can collaborate through the federated learning framework, obtaining additional sensed data to enhance SLAM performance. However, the distinctive radiation structure of the RHS and the information exchange within the federated learning framework introduce complexities to the overall SLAM system design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-vehicle SLAM protocol that regulates RHS-based radar sensing and data processing across multiple vehicles. Additionally, we design algorithms for RHS radiation optimization and federated learning-based localization and mapping. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared to existing phased array-based and non-cooperative schemes.

AB LiDAR is an indispensable sensor for autonomous driving that can provide precise 3D information about the environment. Among various types of LiDARs, mechanical LiDARs are the most commonly used on vehicles that uniformly perceive the scene utilizing rotating motors. However, accurate perception of foreground objects is considered as the most important task in automotive LiDARs, therefore the current operating mode of mechanical LiDARs wastes a significant amount of sensing resources on the useless background. Besides, the development of LiDAR hardware and software systems is currently split into two independent segments, lacking real-time interaction between physical entities and digital models in cyberspace. To address these issues, we propose software-defined active LiDARs for autonomous driving based on parallel intelligence. Active LiDARs redefine LiDAR's hardware operation through software systems to achieve adaptive sensing resource allocation, constituting a closed loop between physical space and cyberspace. During the working process, it calculates scenario heatmaps with the constructed high-definition maps (HD maps) in cyberspace at first. Then it takes prescriptive control of physical LiDARs based on heatmaps to improve sensing resource utilization. We build two adaptive LiDAR models in CARLA and construct a hardware prototype in the parallel sensing platform, DAWN. Active Point Cloud (APC), a new dataset collected in CARLA, is proposed and a 3D object detection task is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of active LiDARs. Our experimental results show that active LiDARs can both improve raw data quality and model performance compared with mechanical LiDARs, especially for the perception of distant objects.

DE Head pose estimation; driver observation
AB We present intrApose, a novel method for continuous 6 DOF head pose estimation from a single camera image without prior detection or landmark localization. We argue that using camera intrinsics alongside the intensity information is essential for accurate pose estimation. The proposed head pose estimation framework is crop-aware and scale-aware, i.e., it keeps poses estimated within image cut-outs consistent with the whole image. It employs a continuous, differentiable rotation representation that simplifies the overall architecture compared to existing methods. Our method is validated on DD-Pose, a challenging real-world in-vehicle driver observation dataset that offers a broad spectrum of poses and occlusion states from naturalistic driving scenarios. In ablation studies we compare rotation and translation errors of intrinsics-aware and -agnostic methods, continuous and discontinuous rotation representations, and data sampling strategies. Experiments show that leveraging camera intrinsics and a continuous rotation representation (SVDO+) results in a balanced mean angular error (BMAE) of 5.8. compared to the intrinsics agnostic baseline with a discontinuous rotation representation (14.8(circle)). Furthermore, training with an unbiased data distribution (most driver measurements are close-to-frontal) improved BMAE on the hard subset (extreme orientations and occlusions) from 15.3(circle) to 9.5(circle)

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT VEHICLES

DT Article
DE Cooperative driving automation; cooperative perception; object detection
   and tracking; LiDAR
AB 3D-LiDAR-based cooperative perception has been generating significant interest for its ability to tackle challenges such as occlusion, sparse point clouds, and out-of-range issues that can be problematic for single-vehicle perception. Despite its effectiveness in overcoming various challenges, cooperative perception's performance can still be affected by the aforementioned issues when Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) operate at the edges of their sensing range. Our proposed approach called HYDRO-3D aims to improve object detection performance by explicitly incorporating historical object tracking information. Specifically, HYDRO-3D combines object detection features from a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm (V2X-ViT) with historical information from the object tracking algorithm to infer objects. Afterward, a novel spatial-temporal 3D neural network performing global and local manipulations of object-tracking historical data is applied to generate the feature map to enhance object detection. The proposed HYDRO-3D method is comprehensively evaluated on the state-of-the-art V2XSet. The qualitative and quantitative experiment results demonstrate that the HYDRO-3D can effectively utilize the object tracking information and achieve robust object detection performance. It outperforms the SOTA V2X-ViT by 3.7% in AP@0.7 of object detection for CAVs and can also be generalized to single-vehicle object detection with 4.5% improvement in AP@0.7.

AB To eliminate the gap between real-world driving emissions and emission regulations, a parallel emission regulatory system is developed for the intelligent transportation system. The main functions of this parallel system can be summarized as real-time monitoring and effective management. Both on-board and on-air (with and without OBD information) monitoring can be realized under different scenarios. Emission managing is a further step through extensive computational experiments and parallel executions. Emission-related solutions can be achieved in this system, such as thermal management, vehicle technology selection, and green route planning. Since accurate estimation and optimization of vehicle NOx emission is still a challenging issue, a case study on NOx is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel system. The proposed modular integrated emission model (MIEM) is the core of the whole system, which integrates vehicle dynamics, powertrain mechanism, engine combustion, and after-treatment systems (ATS) conversion. Two-parameter gear shifting module and transient temperature module are the main contributions of the MIEM, while the novel ATS module makes it possible to estimate the tailpipe emissions (rather than engine-out emissions). Experiments under steady-state, transient-state, and real-wourld driving emissions (RDE) are conducted with the representative test vehicle to obtain universal characteristics, the WLTC dataset, and two different RDE datasets, respectively. Both on-board and on-air monitoring are capable of accurate estimations on NOx emissions under RDE conditions, and the RMSE is much lower than several well-known emission models. Furthermore, optimal solutions for cold-start phase are investigated, and the influences of auxiliary heating and dual TWC configuration are quantified.

AB Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is widely deployed at the edge of Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) to enhance their communication and computational capabilities. However, existing security and privacy preservation solutions for MEC applications in VANETs face several challenges, such as the risk of privacy exposure of vehicle authentication, increased overhead due to cryptographic algorithms, as well as resource occupation and malicious attacks on edge servers. In this paper, we propose an aggregated security solution for the confidential, efficient, and trustworthy sharing of data while safeguarding the privacy of vehicle identities. Firstly, we present a broadcast proxy re-encryption scheme based on cubic spline interpolation that ensures the security of the VANET system and the identity privacy of large-scale vehicles. The re-encryption system is designed to prioritize the reduction of re-encryption computation time rather than focusing on the sizes of re-encryption keys and ciphertexts. We further model the aggregation overhead in terms of communication and computation. Additionally, we propose an efficient protocol based on Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus to facilitate decentralized trust management for edge proxy servers. Our security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme satisfies the security and confidentiality requirements for data sharing in VANETs. Finally, we provide extensive simulations that reveal the performance and effectiveness of our solution.

AB A port-Hamiltonian model is suitable to represent the dynamics of many physical processes, which has an essential feature of underscoring a significance of an energy function, an interconnection pattern, and a dissipation for physical systems. Hence, adaptive path-tracking control with a passivity-based observer is designed by the port-Hamiltonian model for autonomous vehicles in this article. Firstly, a passivity-based observer of lateral velocity is established by designing a gain matrix to assign the interconnection and damping parts, which makes an observation error system transform into a desired port-Hamiltonian system and renders the observer passive. At the same time, it's convergence and stability analysis is given. Then, a port-Hamiltonian model with perturbations and actuator saturations is constructed to describe lateral vehicle dynamics in terms of tracking errors for path-tracking, and an L2-gain disturbance attenuation strategy is developed to overcome the adverse influence caused of external disturbances. Furthermore, the robust stability of the controller is proved in the presence of observation errors and external disturbances. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB This article presents a unified approach to the problem of learning-based optimal control of connected human-driven and autonomous vehicles in mixed-traffic environments including both the freeway and ring road settings. The stabilizability of a string of connected vehicles including multiple autonomous vehicles (AVs) and heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is studied by a model reduction technique and the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) test. For this problem setup, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem is formulated and a solution based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) techniques is proposed without a priori knowledge on model parameters. To start the learning process, an initial stabilizing control law is obtained using the small-gain theorem for the ring road case. It is shown that the obtained stabilizing control law can achieve general L-p string stability under appropriate conditions. Besides, to minimize the impact of external disturbance, a linear quadratic zero-sum game is introduced and solved by an iterative learning-based algorithm. Finally, the simulation results verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed methods achieve desirable performance for control of a mixed-vehicular network.

   comprehension; Language model; BERT
AB Pronoun-drop is a common phenomenon in Chinese, zero pronoun resolution aims to recover the pronoun and resolve the anaphora antecedent of the pronoun, which is important for NLP tasks such as machine translation, information extraction, etc. Most of the existing research methods predefined zero pronoun sets. Zero pronoun recovery is carried out through multi-classification, and then the coreference chains between each pronoun and the candidate antecedent are predicted in turn. However, most of the previous methods only focus on the relationship between pronouns and arguments, ignoring the deep semantic relationship between predicates and arguments as the core semantic component. In addition, the model takes the parse tree (gold tree) as a priori knowledge, which is costly in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a Machine Reading Comprehension model combined with Semantic Dependency (MRC-SD), which takes advantage of the feature that semantic dependencies can directly access deep semantic information across the surface syntactic structure of a sentence to capture the semantic relations between predicates and arguments, and enhance such semantic relations in the form of questions and answers through machine reading comprehension, to extract co-reference chains more accurately. In addition, we propose a method of combining semantic dependency with the language model to realize zero pronoun recovery from the deep semantic level. Experimental results on our self-constructed public opinion dataset (FS-PO) show that the MRC-SD model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-pronoun resolution model.

AB Question answering (QA) is the task of responding to questions posed by users automatically. A questionanswering system is divided into three main components: question analysis, information retrieval, and answer extraction. This paper has focused only on the answer extraction part. In the past couple of years, many QA systems have been developed and become mature and ready for use in different languages. Nevertheless, the advancement of Arabic QA systems still faces different obstacles and a lack of relevant resources and tools for researchers. This paper presents the So2al-wa-Gwab dataset since the publicly available datasets include various faults, such as the use of machine translation to build the data, a short context size, and a small number of question-answer pairings. Thus, this new dataset avoids the aforementioned drawbacks. Furthermore, in this paper, we have trained three deep learning models, namely, Bi-Directional flow network (BiDAF), QA Network (QANet), and BERT model, and tested them on seven different datasets, thus providing a comprehensive comparison between existing Arabic QA datasets. The obtained results emphasize that machine-translated datasets fall backwhen comparedwith human-annotated data. Also, the QA task becomes harder as the context, from which to extract the answer, becomes larger.

AB Text classification is a critical and foundational task in Tibetan natural language processing, it plays a crucial role in various applications, such as sentiment analysis and information extraction. However, the limited availability of annotated data poses a significant challenge to Tibetan natural language processing. This paper proposes a prompt learning-based method for low-resource Tibetan text classification to overcome this challenge. This method utilizes pre-trained language models to learn text representation and generation capabilities on a large-scale unsupervised Tibetan corpus, enabling few-shot Tibetan text classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of Tibetan text classification in low-resource scenarios. This work provides a new research idea and method for low-resource language processing, such as Tibetan natural language processing. Hopefully, it will inspire subsequent work on low-resource language processing.

DE SMS; Algerian dialects; corpus; oversampling; classification
AB In this article, a complete methodology of a corpus realization of authentic Short Message Service (SMS) from Algerian dialect and which are transcribed in Latin characters or symbols is presented. A linguistic material constituted by 6,000 SMS coming from the different geographical regions of Algeria (Middle, East, and West) corresponding to 42 administrative and geographical departments, have been collected. The coexistence of several dialects through these three regions simultaneously has obliged us to consider and operate a classification of the data for each dialect. This data classification has yielded three extracted regional dialectic corpora, each of them covering a specific number of administrative departments. These treatments are based on the so-called Data-n-gram tokenization targeting the suppression of the stop words, the stemming and the imbalance of the classes linked to the nature of the SMS. Consequently, three text classifiers based on three linear classifiers, namely, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), The Ridge Regression (RDG), and Linear Support Vector Machines, to find out the number of significant corpora to extract from the collected data. A deep analysis of the results has shown that the 5-grams data representation is more representative whereas the stop-words removal and stemming process has generated an information loss that has subsequently inferred an alteration of the recognition rate of about 2%. The emerging problem of classes imbalance has been treated by using three techniques: Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minorities Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN). This treatment produced interesting results and enhancements; particularly, the classification by region with the oversampling process SMOTE by using the RDG technique has reached a better percentage of 55.93% whereas the classification by departmentwith the oversampling process ADASYN associated with the SGD has only yielded a maximum score of about 17.11%. The results, which undoubtedly are in favor of the classification by region, have compelled us to create three Subdialectal regional corpora, each, covering a certain number of Algerian departments.

AB Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of automatically determining the meaning of a polysemous word in a specific context. Word sense induction is the unsupervised clustering of word usages in a different context to distinguish senses and perform unsupervised WSD. Most studies consider function words as stop words and delete them in the pre-processing step. However, function words can encode meaningful information that can help to improve the performance ofWSD approaches. We propose in this work a novel approach to solve Arabic verb sense disambiguation that is based on a preposition-based classification that is used in an automatic word sense induction step to build sense inventories to disambiguate Arabic verbs.
   However, in the wake of the success of neural language models, recent works obtained encouraging results using BERT pre-trained models for English-language WSD approaches. Hence, we use contextualized word embeddings for an unsupervised Arabic WSD that is based on linguistic markers and uses sentence-BERT Transformer pre-trained models, which yields encouraging results that outperform other existing unsupervised neural AWSD approaches.

AB Time-frequency analysis (TFA) is a powerful method to exploit the hidden information of signals, including speech signals. Many techniques in this group were invented and developed to capture the most crucial stationary feature. However, human speech is not stable, and it contains some non-stationary elements. This work aims to design a new algorithm via the TFA technique to extract the trends and changes inside the speech signal in the time-frequency (TF) plane. We design a new algorithm to create a set of atoms for the signal transform, which can analyze the signal in many different view directions via Poly-Linear Chirplet Transform (PLCT). After processing the signal, the proposed method returns a multichannel output in which each channel results from a particular Linear Chirplet Transform (LCT). The feature then is combined with the MFCC feature to form the final representation. Although the size for speech representation rises, our extracted feature contains rich-meaning information to improve the recognition results compared to other features in gender recognition, dialect recognition, and speaker recognition.

AB Idiomatic expressions are important natural parts of all languages and prominent parts of our daily speech. Idioms cannot be interpreted from the words that they are formed with directly and people may not understand the meaning. From past literature, it was noted that idiom affects Natural Language Processing research like machine translation, semantic analysis, and sentiment analysis. Other languages like English, Chinese, and Indian idioms are recognized through different methods in different research. As there is no standard method and research to identify Amharic idioms, this study is aimed to build a model to identify idioms for the Amharic language using a supervised machine learning approach. The study used 800 labeled expressions for training and 200 expressions for testing from Amharic idiom books "(sic)" and different Amharic documents. To measure the performance of the model, we used accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. Finally, a 97.5% accuracy result was achieved from the testing dataset showing a promising result. The study contributes to the information systems discourse about improving the awareness and knowledge of researchers on Amharic idioms.

AB Parallel corpus is a key component of statistical and Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While most research focuses on machine translation, corpus creation studies are limited for many languages, and no research paper on a Mizo-English corpus exists yet. A high-quality parallel corpus is required for Natural Language Processing activities including machine translation, Chatbots, Transliteration, and Cross-Language Information Retrieval. This work aims to investigate parallel corpus creation techniques and apply them to the Mizo-English language pair. Another goal is to test machine translation on the newly constructed corpus. We contributed to LF Aligner tool to support Mizo language for Mizo sentence alignment in corpus development. Our effort created the first large-scale Mizo-English parallel corpuswith over 529K sentences. The pre-processed corpus was used for Mizo-to-English NMT. It was evaluated using BLEU, Character F1 Score (ChrF), and Translation Edit Rate (TER) scores. Our system achieved BLEU 45.08, ChrF 65.36, and TER 41.16, setting a new benchmark for Mizo-to-English translation.

AB The vast majority of languages in the world at present are considered to be low-resource languages. Since the availability of large parallel data is crucial for the success of most modern machine translation approaches, improving machine translation for low-resource languages is a key challenge. Most unsupervised techniques for translation benefit closely related languages with monolingual data of substantial quantity. To facilitate research in this direction for the extremely low resource language pair English (en) and Mizo (lus), we have developed a parallel and monolingual corpus for the Mizo language from various news websites. We explore Unsupervised NeuralMachine Translation ( UNMT) based on the developed monolingual data. We observe that cross-lingual embedding (CLWE) initializations on subword segmented data during pre-training, based on both masked language modelling and sequence-to-sequence generation tasks, improve translation performance. We experiment with cross-lingual alignment and combined alignment and joint training for learning the cross-lingual embedding representations. We also report baseline performances and the impact of CLWE initialization using semi-supervised and supervised neural machine translation. Empirical results show that both CLWE initializations work well for the distant pair English-Mizo compared to the baselines.

AB Constituency parsing is an important task of informing how words are combined to form sentences. While constituency parsing in English has seen significant progress in the last few years, tools for constituency parsing in Indonesian remain few and far between. In this work, we publish ICON (Indonesian CONstituency treebank), the hitherto largest publicly available manually-annotated benchmark Indonesian constituency treebank with a size of 10,000 sentences and approximately 124,000 constituents and 182,000 tokens, which can support the training of state-of-the-art transformer-based models. As part of the process of building the treebank, we review and revamp the constituent and POS tagsets in use in existing treebanks to ensure that the labels are relevant and suitable for the grammatical features of Indonesian. We establish strong baselines on the ICON dataset using the Berkeley Neural Parser with transformer-based pre-trained embeddings, with the best performance of 88.85% F1 score coming from our own version of SpanBERT (IndoSpanBERT). We further analyze the predictions made by our best-performing model to reveal certain idiosyncrasies in Indonesian that pose challenges for constituency parsing.

AB ChatGPT OpenAI, a large-language chatbot model, has gained a lot of attention due to its popularity and impressive performance in many natural language processing tasks. ChatGPT produces superior answers to a wide range of real-world human questions and generates human-like text. The new OpenAI ChatGPT technology may have some strengths and weaknesses at this early stage. Users have reported early opinions about the ChatGPT features, and their feedback is essential to recognize and fix its shortcomings and issues. This study uses the ChatGPT tweets Arabic dataset to automatically find user opinions and sentiments about ChatGPT technology. The dataset is preprocessed and labeled using the TextBlob Arabic Python library into positive, negative, and neutral tweets. Despite extensive works for the English language, languages like Arabic are less studied regarding tweet analysis. Existing literature about Arabic tweet sentiment analysis has mainly focused on machine learning and deep learning models. We collected a total of 27,780 unstructured tweets from Twitter using the Tweepy SNscrape Python library using various hash-tags such as # Chat-GPT, #OpenAI, #Chatbot, Chat-GPT3, and so on. To enhance the model's performance and reduce computational complexity, unstructured tweets are converted into structured and normalized forms. Tweets contain missing values, URL and HTML tags, stop words, punctuation, diacritics, elongations, and numeric values that have no impact on the model performance; hence, these increase the computational cost. So, these steps are removed with the help of Python preprocessing libraries to enhance text quality and consistency. This study adopts Transformer-based models such as RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT that automatically classify the tweets. Additionally, a hybrid transformer-based model is proposed to obtain better results. The proposed hybrid model is developed by combining the hidden outputs of the RoBERTA and BERT models using a concatenation layer, then adding dense layers with "Relu" activation employed as a hidden layer to create non-linearity and a "softmax" activation function for multiclass classification. They differ from existing state-of-the-art models due to the enhanced capabilities of both models in text classification. Hybrid models combine the different models to make accurate predictions and reduce bias and enhanced the overall results, while state-of-the-art models are incapable of making accurate predictions. Experiments show that the proposed hybrid model achieves 96.02% accuracy, 100% precision on negative tweets, and 99% recall for neutral tweets. The performance of the proposed model is far better than existing state-of-the-art models.

AB Relation extraction from unstructured Arabic text is especially challenging due to the Arabic language complex morphology and the variation in word semantics and lexical categories. The research documented in this paper presents a hybrid Semantic Knowledge base - Machine Learning (SKML) approach for extracting complex Arabic relations from unstructured Arabic documents; the proposed approach exploits the principles of Functional Discourse Grammar (FDG) to emphasise the semantic and pragmatic properties of the language and facilitate the identification of relation elements. At the initial phase, the novel FDG-SKML relation extraction approach deploys a lexical-based mechanism that utilises a purposely built domain-specific Semantic Knowledge to encode the semantic association between the identified relations' elements. The evaluation of the initial stage evidenced improved accuracy for extracting most complex Arabic relations. The initial relation extraction mechanism was further extended by integrating its output into a Machine Learning classifier that facilitated extracting especially complex relations with significant disparity in the relation elements' presence, order, and correlation. Using Economics as the problem domain, experimental evaluation evidenced the high accuracy of our FDG-SKML approach in complex Arabic relation extraction task and demonstrated its further improvement upon integration with machine learning classifiers.

AB A Part-of-Speech (POS) tagger and Chunker (or shallow parser) are sequence labeling tools, crucial for improving the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like parsing, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, information extraction, and so on. Developing such tools for a low-resource language is an arduous task. Nepali is a relatively resource-poor Indian language and has not been able to evolve from a computational perspective. Therefore, we present effective part-of-speech tagging and chunking tools for the Nepali text using sequential deep learning models-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network with a Conditional Random Field Layer (BI-LSTM-CRF) and other LSTM-based models exploring both character and word embeddings of the Nepali texts. Word Embedding has been used to capture syntactic as well as semantic information whereas character embedding has been applied to capture the morphological as well as shape information of words and also to handle the out-of-vocabulary problem. The developed chunker is the first statistical chunker for the Nepali language. A baseline model with a Conditional Random Field has also been developed to identify the optimum feature set for the aforementioned tasks. The BI-LSTM-CRF model produced an accuracy of 99.20% and 98.40%, for Nepali POS tagging and chunking, respectively. This is the highest-ever accuracy for Nepali. Thorough error analysis and observations have also been reported with examples. The developed tools can help advance research in Nepali language processing, improve the accuracy of language technology applications, and contribute to the preservation and promotion of the Nepali language.

DE Subword segmentation; self-supervised learning; machine translation;
   efficient NLP; subword regularization
AB Sub-word segmentation is an essential pre-processing step for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Existing work has shown that neural sub-word segmenters are better than Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), however, they are inefficient, as they require parallel corpora, days to train, and hours to decode. This article introduces SelfSeg, a self-supervised neural sub-word segmentation method that is much faster to train/decode and requires only monolingual dictionaries instead of parallel corpora. SelfSeg takes as input a word in the form of a partially masked character sequence, optimizes the word generation probability, and generates the segmentation with the maximum posterior probability, which is calculated using a dynamic programming algorithm. The training time of SelfSeg depends on word frequencies, and we explore several word frequency normalization strategies to accelerate the training phase. Additionally, we propose a regularization mechanism that allows the segmenter to generate various segmentations for one word. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct MT experiments in low-, middle-, and high-resource scenarios, where we compare the performance of using different segmentationmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that, on the low-resource ALT dataset, our method achieves more than 1.2 BLEU score improvement compared with BPE and SentencePiece, and a 1.1 score improvement over Dynamic Programming Encoding (DPE) and Vocabulary Learning via Optimal Transport (VOLT), on average. The regularization method achieves approximately a 4.3 BLEU score improvement over BPE and a 1.2 BLEU score improvement over BPE-dropout, the regularized version of BPE. We also observed significant improvements on IWSLT15 Vi -> En, WMT16 Ro -> En, and WMT15 Fi -> En datasets and competitive results on the WMT14 De -> En and WMT14 Fr -> En datasets. Furthermore, our method is 17.8x faster during training and up to 36.8x faster during decoding in a high-resource scenario compared to DPE. We provide extensive analysis, including why monolingual word-level data is enough to train SelfSeg.

AB The development of the Sign Language Corpus has been motivated by its great utility and application to various purposes and research areas. However, some countries do not have their own Sign Language Corpus. Developing a corpus thereby benefits the community of people with speech disabilities in diverse areas such as education. Thus, the motivation to develop this work is to present an advance toward constructing an RGB-D corpus of Mexican Sign Language captured by a Kinect sensor. A total of 90,000 samples of 570 words and 30 phrases interpreted by 150 people who commonly use Mexican Sign Language were collected. Of the participants, 86 were women and 64 were men, aged between 12 and 60 years old. The Mexican Sign Language Corpus was recorded by signers from three different regions of the south of Mexico. The constructed corpus contains depth, color, point clouds, and human skeleton positions. Six hundred of the most used words were selected from 17 semantic fields, considering the variability in the movement of both hands. After training a neural network, the performance developed by the recognition system was 98.62%.

DE Meme explanation; time-sync comment; multimodal analysis
AB Recent years have witnessed the booming of online social media platforms with embracing the popular service called "Time-Sync Comment", which supports the viewers to share their time-sync opinions along with video content. In this way, we observe that numerous semantically-altered terms, or "Memes", were created by niche users to express their unique ideas and emotions, and further attracted a large group of viewers with better activity and enthusiasm. Unfortunately, since the memes were created based on domain-specific knowledge and semantically varied depending on the multimodal context in videos, newcomers may fail to comprehend the semantic connotation of memes, which may severely impair their user-experiences. To deal with this issue, in this article, we propose a novel meme explanation framework, called ProMDE, to automatically capture and comprehend the memes in time-sync comments, which could further benefit the viewers with meme explanation service. Specifically, we first iteratively reconstruct the original time-sync comments compared with visual embedding to detect the semantically-altered terms as meme candidates. Afterward, based on the guides from the domain-specific corpus, visual and textual features will be fused to represent the context-aware multimodal cues. Moreover, to accurately describe the commonly-seen homophones in memes, i.e., they have the same pronunciation but different word-spelling expressions, we integrate the phonetic symbols as an additional modality to enhance the framework. Finally, we utilize a Transformer-based decoder to generate the natural language explanation for captured memes. Extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset prove that our framework could significantly outperform several state-of-the-art baseline methods, demonstrating the efficacy of modeling multimodal context and pronunciation for meme detection and explanation.

DE Open-domain question answering; query expansion; passage retrieval;
   pseudo-relevance feedback
AB Humans are accustomed to autonomously associating prior knowledge with the text in a query when answering questions. However, for machines lacking cognition and common sense, a query is merely a combination of some words. Although we can enrich the semantic information of the given query through language representation or query expansion (QE), the information contained in the query is still insufficient. In this paper, we propose an effective passage retrieval method named query context expansion-based retrieval (QCER) for open-domain question answering (OpenQA). QCER associates a query with domain information by adding contextual association information based on the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF). QCER uses a dense reader to select top-n expansion terms for QE. We implement QCER by appending reader predictions, theoretically present in candidate passages, as contextual information to the initial query to form the new query. QCER with sparse representations (BM25) can improve retrieval efficiency and accelerate query convergence so that the reader can find the desired answer using fewer relevant passages, e.g., 10 passages, as soon as possible. Moreover, QCER can be easily combined with dense passage retrieval (DPR) to achieve even better performance, as sparse and dense representations are often complementary. Remarkably, we demonstrate that QCER achieves state-of-the-art performance in three tasks, passage retrieval, passage reading, and passage reranking, on the Natural Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA (Trivia) datasets under an extractive QA setup.

AB With the rapid development of computer vision and artificial intelligence technology, visual object detection has made unprecedented progress, and small object detection in complex scenes has attracted more and more attention. To solve the problems of ambiguity, overlap and occlusion in small object detection in complex scenes. In this paper, a multi-scale fusion feature enhanced path aggregation network MSFE-PANet is proposed. By adding attention mechanism and feature fusion, the fusion of strong positioning information of deep feature map and strong semantic information of shallow feature map is enhanced, which helps the network to find interesting areas in complex scenes and improve its sensitivity to small objects. The rejection loss function and network prediction scale are designed to solve the problems of missing detection and false detection of overlapping and blocking small objects in complex backgrounds. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 40.7% on the VisDrone2021 dataset and 89.7% on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Comparative analysis with mainstream object detection algorithms proves the superiority of this method in detecting small objects in complex scenes.

TI Super-Resolution Reconstruction Based on Adaptive Weight Adjustment

DE Super-resolution; feature extraction; adaptive weight; attentional
   mechanism
AB In image super-resolution, the existing convolution neural network methods increase the number of network layers and filters to achieve better performance, and seldom consider the influence of different branches in feature extraction on the reconstruction effect, which leads to the problems of blurred details and unclear visual perception. Therefore, we propose an adaptive weight adjustment super-resolution (AWSR) reconstruction model in this paper. The model includes Shallow Feature Extraction (SFE), Information Extraction Enhancement Block (IDEB) and Reconstruction Block (RB). IDEB composed of Adaptive Weight Blocks (AWB) and Channel Linking Layers (CLL) learns a deeper mapping relationship between LR image and HR image by adaptively adjusting the proportions of different branches. It not only saves computational cost, but also improves the expression ability of the model. Meanwhile, the performance of the model is further improved by dimension change in the up-sample block. Especially, the image edge and texture reconstruction effects are obviously improved. Compared with SRNHARB algorithm proposed in 2021, the PSNR values are increased by 0.23dB, 0.19dB and 0.02dB at x 2,x3,x4 on the Set5 dataset. Moreover, the proposed model has a strong generalization ability, and the reconstructed SR images can achieve satisfactory results.

DE Semantic segmentation; medical image; transformer; multi-scale branch
AB Because of the limitations of convolution kernel, the traditional image segmentation network is not sufficient to obtain the context information, but the image segmentation task is very dependent on the context information. Transformer's linear input can just get enough context information. In this paper, we propose a transformer segmentation network hyperfusion transformer based on a pyramid structure. First, the model divides the single-scale coding form into several-different-scale coding forms, and then fuses the decoding results. Second, in order to ensure the specificity of the output characteristics of each branch, we orthogonalize the results of a variety of different scales. By orthogonalizing in pairs, we can ensure that the results obtained by different branches are not completely similar to a certain extent, and reduce the redundancy of branch information. On the two datasets, the method in this paper surpasses a variety of classical models under multiple evaluation indexes, confirming that it is an effective segmentation method.

AB Document Image Understanding is a demanding Pattern Recognition problem that requires complex recognition models. This problem is even more difficult for document images with complicated layouts like tables, where the reading order is often intrinsically ambiguous, and consequently, the context is generally ambiguous as well. In this paper, we compare two machine learning approaches for extracting information in pre-printed historical tables with handwritten information. We analyze the performance of each approach at each step of the extraction process over different corpora, up to a realistic scenario where documents with different table layouts written by different hands are used. The results are good in general and show that a model based on Multilayer Perceptrons yields better results on more homogeneous documents, while another model based on Graph Neural Networks generalizes better on heterogeneous corpora.

AB In the context of Multiple Criteria Decision Making, this paper studies the robustness of the sign of nonadditivity index for subset of criteria in a Choquet integral model. In the case where the set of alternatives is discrete, the use of the nonadditivity index proposed in the literature often leads to interpretations which are not always robust. Indeed, the sign of this nonadditivity index can depend on the arbitrary choice of a numerical representation in the set of all numerical representations compatible with the ordinal preferential information given by the Decision Maker. We characterize the ordinal preferential information for which the problem appears. We also propose a linear program allowing to test the non robustness of the sign of nonadditivity index for subset of criteria.

AB Uncertainty measures are instrumental in describing the classification abilities in information systems, and uncertain information has been measured and processed with granular computing theory. While the fuzzy set-valued information system is a generalization of fuzzy information systems, the relationship between the information granulation and the uncertainty in fuzzy set-valued information systems remains to be studied. This paper probes into uncertainty measures in fuzzy set-valued information systems based on the fuzzy beta-neighborhood and the idea of granulation. Specifically, the fuzzy beta-neighborhood similarity relation that reflects the similarity between two objects is defined in terms of the nearness degree. We propose the concepts of information granules and granular structures induced by fuzzy beta-neighborhood similarity relations, based on which we introduce the granularity measures and rough approximation measures of granular structures in fuzzy set-valued information systems. Given the situation of decision information systems, we propose the granularity-based rough approximation measures by combining granularity measures with rough approximation measures. Experiment results and effectiveness analysis show that the measures we proposed are reasonable and feasible.

AB As a novel intelligent algorithm, fireworks algorithm (FWA) is applied to deal with different types of optimization problems. Since FWA's search processes are relatively simple, it is inefficient. In this paper, a dynamic multi-swarm competitive fireworks algorithm (DMCFWA) is developed to enhance the search capability of FWA. Firstly, based on the scaling coefficient updated by utilizing the fitness value of the optimal firework, the dynamic explosion amplitude strategy is proposed to improve the search capability of the best firework. Secondly, utilizing the location information of the fireworks, an improved search method is designed to enhance the local search capability of firework swarms. Thirdly, a multi-swarm independent selection technique and a restart operation are adopted to boost its abilities of global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, to reduce the computational cost of FWA, a new initialization method is used and a new model for calculating the spark number is embedded in DMCFWA. By adopting these strategies, DMCFWA easily implements and does well in exploitation and exploration. CEC2017 test suite and four engineering constraint problems are used to demonstrate the performance of DMCFWA. Experimental results show that DMCFWA performs more effectively and stably than its competitors.

AB Based on this article, a fuzzy NN (neural network) based on the EBA (evolved bat algorithm) was developed to devise adaptive control with gray signal prediction to provide asymptomatic stability and increased driving comfort. The method is used to assess plant nonlinearity and to perform structural tracking of the signal. The set of Gray's differential equations is applied to Gray's model (GM) (n, h), which has been an active system model. In the model, n is the order of the Gray's differential equation and h is the number of variables considered.

AB Nowadays, many sequences of events are generated in areas as diverse as healthcare, finance, and social network. People have been studying these data for a long time. They hope to predict the type and occurrence time of the next event by using relationships among events in the data. recently, with the successful application of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in natural language processing, it has been introduced into point process. However, RNN cannot capture the long-term dependence among events well, and self-attention can partially mitigate this problem precisely. Transformer Hawkes Process (THP) using self-attention greatly improves the performance of the Hawkes Process, but THP cannot ignore the effect of irrelevant events, which will affect the computational complexity and prediction accuracy of the model. In this paper, we propose an Adaptively Sparse Transformers Hawkes Process (ASTHP). ASTHP considers the periodicity and nonlinearity of event time in the time encoding process. The sparsity of the ASTHP is achieved by substituting Softmax with & alpha;-entmax: & alpha;-entmax is a differentiable generalization of Softmax that allows unrelated events to gain exact zero weight. By optimizing the neural network parameters, different attention heads can adaptively select sparse modes (from Softmax to Sparsemax). Compared with the existing models, ASTHP model not only ensures the prediction performance but also improves the interpretability of the model. For example, the accuracy of ASTHP model on MIMIC-II dataset is improved by nearly 3 percentage points, and the model fitting degree and stability are also improved significantly.

AB The quality of food and the safety of consumer is one of the major essential things in our day-to-day life. To ensure the quality of foods through their various attributes, different types of methods have been introduced. In this proposed method, three underlying blocks namely Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor (HFICE), Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier (HCFC) and CNN for Food Quality Analyzer (CFQA). Hyperspectral Food Image Context Extractor module is used as the preprocess to get food attributes such as texture, color, size, shape and molecular particulars. Hyperspectral Context Fuzzy Classifier module identifies a particular part of the food (zone entity) is whether carbohydrate, fat, protein, water or unusable core. CNN for Food Quality Analyzer module uses a Tuned Convolutional layer, Heuristic Activation Operation, Parallel Element Merge Layer and a regular Fully Connected Layer. Indian Pines, Salinas and Pavia are the benchmark dataset to evaluate hyperspectral image-based machine learning procedures. These datasets are used along with a dedicated Chicken meat HSI dataset is used in the training and testing process. Results are obtained that about 7.86% of average values in various essential evaluation metrics such as performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity have improved when compared to existing state of the art results.

ID SEMI-SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK
AB Recently, structured computing has become an interesting topic in the world of artificial intelligence, especially in the field ofmachine learning, as most researchers focus on the development of graph-based semi-supervised learning models. In this article, we present a new framework for graph-based semi-supervised learning. We present a powerful method for simultaneous label inference and linear transform estimation. The targeted linear transformation is used to obtain a discriminant subspace. To improve semi-supervised learning, our framework focuses on exploiting the data structure and soft labels of the available unlabeled samples. In the iterative optimization scheme used, the prior estimation of the label increases the supervision information indirectly through an introduced informative matrix called the label graph, thus avoiding the use of hard confidence-based decisions as used in self-supervised methods. In addition, the estimation of labels and projected data is made more robust by using smoothing concepts based on hybrid graphs. For each type of smoothing, the hybrid graph is an adaptive fusion of the two graphs encoding the similarity of the data and the similarity of the labels. The proposed method leads to an improved discriminative linear transformation. Several experimental results on real image datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. They also show superior performance compared to semi-supervised methods that use integration and label inference simultaneously.

AB Traffic forecasting is one of the most popular spatio-temporal tasks in the field of machine learning. A prevalent approach in the field is to combine graph convolutional networks and recurrent neural networks for the spatio-temporal processing. There has been fierce competition and many novel methods have been proposed. In this article, we present the method of spatio-temporal graph neural rough differential equation (STG-NRDE). Neural rough differential equations (NRDEs) are a breakthrough concept for processing time-series data. Their main concept is to use the log-signature transform to convert a time-series sample into a relatively shorter series of feature vectors. We extend the concept and design two NRDEs: one for the temporal processing and the other for the spatial processing. After that, we combine them into a single framework. We conduct experiments with 6 benchmark datasets and 27 baselines. STG-NRDE shows the best accuracy in all cases, outperforming all those 27 baselines by non-trivial margins.

ID ATTACKS
AB Federated learning, as a distributed machine learning framework, enables clients to conduct model training without transmitting their data to the server, which is used to solve the dilemma of data silos and data privacy. It can work well on clients having similar data characteristics and distribution. However, it has some limitations where the dataset of clients may be different in distribution, quantity, and concept in many application scenarios. Personalized federated learning is a new federated learning paradigm that aims to guarantee client personalized models' effectiveness when collaborating with the cloud server. Intuitively, providing further facilitated collaborations for the clients with similar data characteristics and distribution can benefit personalized model building. However, due to the invisibility of client data, it is challenging to extract client characteristics and define collaborative relationships among them from a fine-grained view. Moreover, a reasonable collaborative training approach needs to be designed for a distributed server-client framework. In this article, we design a Hierarchical Attention-enhanced Meta-learning Network (HAM) to address this issue. The main advantage of HAM is that it utilizes the meta-learning approach of taking model parameters as features and learns to learn an extra model for each client to analyze similarities according to their local dataset automatically. According to its two-layers framework, HAM can reasonably achieve a tradeoff between clients' personality and commonality and provides a hybrid model with useful information from all clients. Considering there are two networks (HAM and base network) that need to learn for each client during the federated training process, we then provide an alternative learning approach to train them in an end-to-end fashion. To further clarify the approach, we describe the personalized federated learning settings framework as FedHAM where the HAM network is distributed deployed in each client. Extensive experiments based on two datasets prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under different evaluation metrics.

The development of intelligent systems and technology provides an opportunity to improve the frequency and scale of dynamic road network optimization. However, such improvements are hindered by the high computational complexity of the existing algorithms that generate the optimization plans. We present a novel solution that integrates machine learning and road network optimization. Our solution consists of two complementary parts. The first part is an efficient algorithm that uses reinforcement learning to find the best road network configurations at real-time. The second part is a dynamic routing mechanism, which helps connected vehicles adapt to the change of the road network. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can substantially reduce the average travel time in a variety of scenarios, whilst being computationally efficient and hence applicable to real-life situations.

AB Community structure is a typical characteristic of complex networks. Finding communities in complex networks has many important applications, such as the advertisement and recommendation based on social networks and the discovery of new protein molecules in biological networks, which make it a hot topic in the field of complex network analysis. With the increasing concerns about the leakage of personal privacy, discovering communities spread across the local networks owned by multiple participants accurately while preserving each participant's privacy has become an emerging challenge in distributed community detection. In this article, we propose a general federated graph learning model for privacy-preserving distributed graph learning and develop two federated clique percolation algorithms (CPAs) based on it to discover overlapping communities distributed across multiple participants' local networks without disclosing any participant's network privacy. Homomorphic encryption and hash operation are used in combination to protect the privacy of the vertices and edges of each local network. Furthermore, vertex attributes are involved in the calculation of clique similarity and clique percolation when dealing with attributed networks. The experimental results on real-world and artificial datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve identical results to those of their stand-alone counterparts and more than 200% higher accuracy than the simple distributed CPAs without federating learning.

DE Travel time estimation; spatio-temporal correlations; graph neural
   networks; road modeling; neural architecture search
AB Travel time estimation (TTE) is a crucial task in intelligent transportation systems, which has been widely used in navigation and route planning. In recent years, several deep learning frameworks have been proposed to capture the dynamic features of road segments or intersections for travel time estimation. However, most existing works do not consider the joint features of the intersections and road segments. Moreover, most deep neural networks for TTE are designed based on empirical knowledge. Since the independent and joint features of intersections and road segments commonly vary with different datasets, the empirical deterministic neural architectures have limited adaptability to different scenarios. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel automated deep learning framework, namely Automated Spatio-Temporal Dual Graph Convolutional Networks (Auto-STDGCN), for travel time estimation. Specifically, we propose to construct the node-wise graph and edge-wise graph to characterize the spatio-temporal features of intersections and road segments, respectively. In order to capture the joint spatio-temporal correlations of the dual graphs, a hierarchical neural architecture search approach is introduced, whose search space is composed of internal and external search space. In the internal search space, spatial graph convolution and temporal convolution operations are adopted to capture the respective spatio-temporal correlations of the dual graphs. Further, we design the external search space including the node-wise and edge-wise graph convolution operations from the internal architecture search to capture the interaction patterns between the intersections and road segments. We evaluate our proposed model Auto-STDGCN on three real-world datasets, which demonstrates that our model is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also conduct case studies to visualize and explain the neural architectures learned by our model.

AB As computer architectures continue to integrate application-specific hardware, it is critical to understand the relative performance of devices for maximum app acceleration. The goal of benchmarking suites, such as MLPerf for analyzing machine learning (ML) hardware performance, is to standardize a fair comparison of different hardware architectures. However, there are many apps that are not well represented by these standards that require different workloads, such asMLmodels and datasets, to achieve similar goals. Additionally, many apps, like real-time video processing, are focused on latency of computations rather than strictly on throughput. This research analyzes multiple compute architectures that featureML-specific hardware on a case study of handwritten Chinese character recognition. Specifically, AlexNet and a custom version of GoogLeNet are benchmarked in terms of their streaming latency and maximum throughput for optical character recognition. Considering that these models are composed of fundamental neural network operations yet architecturally different from each other, these models can stress devices in different yet insightful ways that generalizations of the performance of other models can be drawn from. Many devices featuring ML-specific hardware and optimizations are analyzed including Intel and AMD CPUs, Xilinx and Intel FPGAs, NVIDIA GPUs, and Google TPUs. Overall, ML-oriented hardware added to the Intel Xeon CPUs helps to boost throughput by 3.7x and to reduce latency by up to 34.7x, which makes the latency of Intel Xeon CPUs competitive on more parallel models. The TPU devices were limited in terms of throughput due to large data transfer times and not competitive in terms of latency. The FPGA frameworks showcase the lowest latency on the Xilinx Alveo U200 FPGA achieving 0.48 ms on AlexNet using Mipsology Zebra and 0.39 ms on GoogLeNet using Vitis-AI. Through their custom acceleration datapaths coupled with high-performance SRAM, the FPGAs are able to keep critical model data closer to processing elements for lower latency. The massively parallel and high-memory GPU devices with Tensor Core accelerators achieve the best throughput. The NVIDIA Tesla A100 GPU showcases the highest throughput at 42,513 and 52,484 images/second for AlexNet and GoogLeNet, respectively.

AB Mobile apps have become an indispensable part of people's daily lives. Users determine what apps to use and when and where to use them based on their tastes, interests, and personal demands, depending on their personality traits. This article aims to infer user profiles from their spatiotemporal mobile app usage behavior. Specifically, we first transform mobile app usage records into a heterogeneous graph. On the graph, nodes represent users, apps, locations, and time slots. Edges describe the co-occurrence of entities in usage records. We then develop a multi-relational heterogeneous graph attention network (MRel-HGAN), an end-to-end system for user profiling. MRel-HGAN first adopts a neighbor sampling strategy based on bootstrapping to sample heavily connected neighbors of a fixed size for each node. Next, we design a relational graph convolutional operation and a multi-relational attention operation. Through such modules, MRel-HGAN can generate node embedding by sufficiently leveraging the rich semantic information of the multi-relational structure in the mobile app usage graph. Experimental results on real-world mobile app usage datasets show the effectiveness and superiority of our MRel-HGAN in the user profiling task for attributes of gender and age.

ID COMPONENT ANALYSIS
AB Satellite imagery depicts the Earth's surface remotely and provides comprehensive information for many applications, such as land use monitoring and urban planning. Existing studies on unsupervised representation learning for satellite images only take into account the images' geographic information, ignoring human activity factors. To bridge this gap, we propose using the Point-of-Interest (POI) data to capture human factors and designing a contrastive learning-based framework to consolidate the representation of satellite imagery with POI information. Besides, we introduce a season-invariant representation learning model on satellite imagery, considering that human factors are mostly unchanging with respect to seasons. An attention model is designed at last to merge the representations from the geographic, seasonal, and POI perspectives adaptively. On the basis of real-world datasets collected from Beijing,1 we evaluate our method for predicting socioeconomic indicators. The results show that the representation containing POI information outperforms the geographic representation in estimating commercial activity-related indicators. Our proposed attentional framework can estimate the socioeconomic indicators with R-2 of 0.874 and outperforms the baseline methods. Furthermore, we explore the differences in the representations of satellite imageswith varying socioeconomic statuses. Finally, we investigate the impact of geographic and POI perspective information in the representation learning process, as well as the effect of satellite imagery on various spatial resolutions.

TI COMET: Convolutional Dimension Interaction for Collaborative Filtering
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Representation learning-based recommendation models play a dominant role among recommendation techniques. However, most of the existing methods assume both historical interactions and embedding dimensions are independent of each other, and thus regrettably ignore the high-order interaction information among historical interactions and embedding dimensions. In this article, we propose a novel representation learning-based model called COMET (COnvolutional diMEnsion inTeraction), which simultaneously models the high-order interaction patterns among historical interactions and embedding dimensions. To be specific, COMET stacks the embeddings of historical interactions horizontally at first, which results in two "embedding maps". In this way, internal interactions and dimensional interactions can be exploited by convolutional neural networks (CNN) with kernels of different sizes simultaneously. A fully connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is then applied to obtain two interaction vectors. Lastly, the representations of users and items are enriched by the learnt interaction vectors, which can further be used to produce the final prediction. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various public implicit feedback datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed method.

DE Few-shot learning; meta-learning; survey
AB The generic object detection (GOD) task has been successfully tackled by recent deep neural networks, trained by an avalanche of annotated training samples from some common classes. However, it is still non-trivial to generalize these object detectors to the novel long-tailed object classes, which have only few labeled training samples. To this end, the Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) has been topical recently, as it mimics the humans' ability of learning to learn and intelligently transfers the learned generic object knowledge from the common heavy-tailed to the novel long-tailed object classes. Especially, the research in this emerging field has been flourishing in recent years with various benchmarks, backbones, and methodologies proposed. To review these FSOD works, there are several insightful FSOD survey articles [58, 59, 74, 78] that systematically study and compare them as the groups of fine-tuning/transfer learning and meta-learning methods. In contrast, we review the existing FSOD algorithms from a new perspective under a new taxonomy based on their contributions, i.e., data-oriented, model-oriented, and algorithm-oriented. Thus, a comprehensive survey with performance comparison is conducted on recent achievements of FSOD. Furthermore, we also analyze the technical challenges, the merits and demerits of these methods, and envision the future directions of FSOD. Specifically, we give an overview of FSOD, including the problem definition, common datasets, and evaluation protocols. The taxonomy is then proposed that groups FSOD methods into three types. Following this taxonomy, we provide a systematic review of the advances in FSOD. Finally, further discussions on performance, challenges, and future directions are presented.

AB Every day, our living city produces a tremendous amount of spatial-temporal data, involved with multiple sources from the individual scale to the city scale. Undoubtedly, such massive urban data can be explored for a better city and better life, as what the urban computing community has been dedicating in recent years. Nevertheless, existing studies are still facing the challenges of data fusion for the urban data as well as the knowledge distillation for specific applications. Moreover, there is a lack of full-featured and user-friendly platforms for both researchers and developers in the urban computing scenario. Therefore, in this article, we present UrbanKG, an urban knowledge graph system to incorporate a knowledge graph with urban computing. Specifically, the system introduces a complete scheme to construct a knowledge graph for urban data fusion. Built upon the data layer, the system further develops the multiple layers of construction, storage, algorithm, operation, and applications, which achieve knowledge distillation and support various functions to the users. We perform representative use cases and demonstrate the system capability of boosting performance in various downstream applications, indicating a promising research direction for knowledge-driven urban computing.

In Declarative Process Mining, process models are represented as sets of temporal constraints (instead of procedural descriptions where all control-flow details are explicitly modeled). An open research direction in Declarative Process Mining is whether multiperspective specifications can be supported, i.e., specifications that not only describe the process behavior from the control-flow point of view, but also from other perspectives like data or time. In this article, we address this question by considering SAT (Propositional Satisfiability Problem) as a solving technology for a number of classical problems in Declarative Process Mining, namely, log generation, conformance checking, and temporal query checking. To do so, we first express each problem as a suitable FO (First-Order) theory whose bounded models represent solutions to the problem, and then find a bounded model of such theory by compilation into SAT.

AB In recent years, automatic skin lesion diagnosis methods based on artificial intelligence have achieved great success. However, the lack of labeled data, visual similarity between skin diseases, and restriction on private data sharing remain the major challenges in skin lesion diagnosis. In this article, first, we propose a federated contrastive learning framework to break down data silos and enhance the generalizability of diagnosticmodel to unseen data. Subsequently, by combining data features from different participated nodes, the proposed framework can improve the performance of contrastive training. To extract discriminative features during on-device training, we propose a contrastive learning based intelligent skin lesion diagnosis scheme in edge computing networks. Specifically, a contrastive learning based dual encoder network is designed to overcome training sample scarcity by fully leveraging unlabeled samples for performance improvement. Meanwhile, we devise a maximum mean discrepancy based supervised contrastive loss function, which can efficiently explore complex intra-class and inter-class variances of samples. Finally, the diagnosis simulations demonstrate that compared with existing methods, our proposed scheme can achieve superior accuracy in both on-device training and distributed training scenarios.

DE Social network alignment; unsupervised learning; matrix factorization
AB Social network alignment, identifying social accounts of the same individual across different social networks, shows fundamental importance in a wide spectrum of applications, such as link prediction and information diffusion. Individuals more often than not join in multiple social networks, and it is in fact much too expensive or even impossible to acquiring supervision for guiding the alignment. To the best of our knowledge, few method in the literature can align multiple social networks without supervision. In this article, we propose to study the problem of unsupervised multiple social network alignment. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised model of joint Matrix factorization with a diagonal Cone under orthogonal Constraint, referred to asMC(2). Its core idea is to embed and alignmultiple social networks in the common subspace via an unsupervised approach. Specifically, inMC(2) model, we first design amatrix optimization to infer the common subspace from different social networks. To address the nonconvex optimization, we then design an efficient alternating algorithm by leveraging its inherent functional property. Through extensive experiments on realworld datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed MC2 model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI TowardsQuery-Efficient Black-Box Attacks: A Universal Dual
   Transferability-Based Framework
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Black-box attack; query efficiency; transferability; model
   interpretation
AB Adversarial attacks have threatened the application of deep neural networks in security-sensitive scenarios. Most existing black-box attacks fool the target model by interacting with it many times and producing global perturbations. However, all pixels are not equally crucial to the target model; thus, indiscriminately treating all pixels will increase query overhead inevitably. In addition, existing black-box attacks take clean samples as start points, which also limits query efficiency. In this article, we propose a novel black-box attack framework, constructed on a strategy of dual transferability (DT), to perturb the discriminative areas of clean examples within limited queries. The first kind of transferability is the transferability of model interpretations. Based on this property, we identify the discriminative areas of clean samples for generating local perturbations. The second is the transferability of adversarial examples, which helps us to produce local pre-perturbations for further improving query efficiency. We achieve the two kinds of transferability through an independent auxiliary model and do not incur extra query overhead. After identifying discriminative areas and generating pre-perturbations, we use the pre-perturbed samples as better start points and further perturb them locally in a black-box manner to search the corresponding adversarial examples. The DT strategy is general; thus, the proposed framework can be applied to different types of black-box attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to show that, under various system settings, our framework can significantly improve the query efficiency of existing black-box attacks and attack success rates.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Sentence representation learning is a crucial task in natural language processing, as the quality of learned representations directly influences downstream tasks, such as sentence classification and sentiment analysis. Transformer-based pretrained language models such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) have been extensively applied to various natural language processing tasks, and have exhibited moderately good performance. However, the anisotropy of the learned embedding space prevents BERT sentence embeddings from achieving good results in the semantic textual similarity tasks. It has been shown that contrastive learning can alleviate the anisotropy problem and significantly improve sentence representation performance. Therefore, there has been a surge in the development of models that utilize contrastive learning to fine-tune BERT-like pretrained language models to learn sentence representations. But no systematic review of contrastive learning models for sentence representations has been conducted. To fill this gap, this article summarizes and categorizes the contrastive learning based sentence representation models, common evaluation tasks for assessing the quality of learned representations, and future research directions. Furthermore, we select several representative models for exhaustive experiments to illustrate the quantitative improvement of various strategies on sentence representations.

DE Sea surface temperature prediction; graph neural networks;
   spatial-temporal modeling; hierarchical correlation
AB Sea surface temperature (SST) is one critical parameter of global climate change, and accurate SST prediction is important to various applications, e.g., weather forecasting, fishing directions, and disaster warnings. The global ocean system is unified and complex, and the SST patterns in different oceanic regions are highly diverse and correlated. However, existing data-driven SST prediction methods mainly consider the local patterns within a certain oceanic region, e.g., El Nino region and the Black sea. It is challenging but necessary to model the global SST correlations rather than that in a specific region to enhance the prediction accuracy of SST. In this work, we proposed a new method called Hierarchical Graph Recurrent Network (HiGRN) to address the issue. First, to learn the dynamic and diverse local SST patterns of specific locations, we design an adaptive node embedding with self-learned parameters to learn various SST patterns. Then we develop a hierarchical cluster generator to aggregate the locations with similar patterns into regional clusters and utilize a graph convolution network to learn the spatial correlations among these clusters. Finally, we introduce a multi-level attention mechanism to fuse the local patterns and regional correlations, and the output is fed into a recurrent network to achieve SST predictions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that our method largely outperforms the state-of-the-art SST prediction methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/Neoyanghc/HiGRN.

TI Noise-aware Local Model Training Mechanism for Federated Learning
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; mislabeled samples; noise-aware; meta learning;
   label correction
AB As a new paradigm in training intelligent models, federated learning is widely used to train a global model without requiring local data to be uploaded from end devices. However, there are often mislabeled samples (i.e., noisy samples) in the dataset, which will cause the model update to deviate from the correct direction during the training process, thus reducing the convergence accuracy of the global model. Existing works employ noisy label correction techniques to reduce the impact of noisy samples on model updates by correcting labels; however, such methods necessitate the use of prior knowledge and additional communication costs, which cannot be directly applied to federated learning due to data privacy concerns and limited communication resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a noise-aware local model training method that corrects the noisy labels directly at the end device under the constraints of federated learning. By constructing a label correction model, a joint optimization problem is formally defined for optimizing both the label correction model and the client-side local training model (e.g., classification model). As a solution to this optimization problem, we propose a robustness training algorithm using label correction, along with a cross-validation data sampling algorithm that updates both models simultaneously. It is verified through experiments that the mechanism can effectively improve the model convergence accuracy on noisy datasets in federated learning scenarios.

AB Collective intelligence design has become a new paradigm for product design. This design pattern breaks the situation of information closure, resource tension, and insufficient innovation caused by traditional product design. Individuals act and contribute in diverse ways in collective intelligence design communities, gradually developing distinct user roles. Identifying the dynamic evolution path of user roles is crucial to properly allocating community traffic and increasing user stickiness. However, the majority of previous research solely discusses the roles that users play and their contributions, omitting the reality that user roles alter dynamically as the community develops. Therefore, to refine existing research, this paper introduces a user role identification model and summarizes the user role evolution paths through time series analysis. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by its use on Thingiverse, the world's largest online design platform. This paper contributes three points to the study of user role identification and evolution. First, this paper identifies six typical user roles. Secondly, this paper portrays four stages of the design community's evolution. Finally, this paper presents the dynamic evolution paths of different user roles and proposes evolutionary optimization strategies for distinct roles. These conclusions enrich user role research from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

ID ROOT CAUSE DIAGNOSIS; PREDICTION; FAULTS
AB Abnormal energy consumption mode tracing is used to locate the root cause of the system deviating from the normal energy consumption mode (ECM), in order to support operators in understanding system abnormal changes and abnormal propagation trends. Due to the compensatory effect of closed-loop control systems on external interference and the influence of processes such as coarse powder regrinding and circulating air utilization during grinding, there is a strong correlation between parameters, and anomalies are easily propagated between parameters. Tracing the root cause variable of anomalies is challenging. Previous abnormal ECM tracing ignored the dynamic changes in causal relationships between coupled variables in the circulation process, and had problems with strong expert knowledge dependence and slow response. Therefore, this paper proposes an abnormal ECM tracing method based on causal network structure evolution analysis. It proposes directed symbolic transfer entropy to measure variable causal relationships, and combines the advantages of complex networks in characterizing complex system dynamic characteristics to construct an ECM causal network. By analyzing network structure characteristics, it locates the root cause variables of abnormal ECMs and infers propagation paths. Finally, through the application of six types of abnormal scenarios in actual slag grinding processes, it verifies the accuracy of the proposed method in locating abnormal roots and identifying propagation paths.

DE RUL prediction; Adaptive graph convolution; Spatial-temporal graph;
   Multi-sensor fusion
AB Due to complex spatial correlations, dynamic temporal trends, and heterogeneities, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is a challenging task for multi-sensor complex systems. Existing frameworks usually design complex graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for multi-sensor information fusion to capture shared patterns with predefined graphs. However, predefined graphs do not necessarily reflect correct and complete correlations among sensors. Furthermore, dynamic temporal trend extraction based on an iterative mechanism will bring the challenge of error accumulation from a global perspective and ignore the heterogeneous correlations. To overcome these limitations, a novel graph neural network framework, namely, Spatial- temporal Dual-channel Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (SDAGCN), is proposed for RUL prediction. It mainly consists of dual channels, including the local and global spatial-temporal modules with learnable graphs, which adaptively capture hidden spatial correlations. Benefiting from these two modules, SDAGCN can effectively extract hidden spatial correlations along the local and global time axis and heterogeneities. Finally, the superior performance of our model is verified by two simulated aircraft engine dataset with multiple sensors.

ID REGRESSION
AB In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), a common objective is the approximation of unknown target functions y = f (x) using limited instances S = ( x((i)), y((i))), where x((i)) epsilon D and D represents the domain of interest. We refer to S as the training set and aim to identify a low-complexity mathematical model that can effectively approximate this target function for new instances x. Consequently, the model ' s generalization ability is evaluated on a separate set T = {x(j)} subset of D, where T not equal S, frequently with T boolean AND S = circle divide, to assess its performance beyond the training set. However, certain applications require accurate approximation not only within the original domain D but in an extended domain D ' that encompasses D as well. This becomes particularly relevant in scenarios involving the design of new structures, where minimizing errors in approximations is crucial. For example, when developing new materials through data-driven approaches, the AI/ML system can provide valuable insights to guide the design process by serving as a surrogate function. Consequently, the learned model can be employed to facilitate the design of new laboratory experiments. In this paper, we propose a method for multivariate regression based on iterative fitting of a continued fraction, incorporating additive spline models. We compare the performance of our method with established techniques, including AdaBoost, Kernel Ridge, Linear Regression, Lasso Lars, Linear Support Vector Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and XGBoost. To evaluate these methods, we focus on an important problem in the field, namely, predicting the critical temperature of superconductors based on their physicalchemical characteristics.

AB The global optimization and design of interplanetary trajectories is one of the most important tasks in deep space exploration. Its search space is often characterized by multi-constraints, extreme non-linearity and sensitivity to initial conditions. To cope with these difficulties, an improved reinforcement learning-based hybrid differential evolution (DE) named RL_HDE is proposed in this paper. In RL_HDE, a novel multi-mutation strategy LSHADE based on an adaptive Q-Learning framework is proposed for global exploration. To further balance the global exploration and local exploitation of RL_HDE, a new parameter adaptive strategy based on Q-Learning is designed to control two trigger parameters. The performance of RL_HDE is verified by the well-known Global Trajectory Optimization Problems (GTOP), which are developed by Advanced Concepts Team of European Space Agency (ESA-ACT). A comparison of RL_HDE with three sets of algorithms, including ten state-of-the-art hybrid evolutionary algorithms, four interplanetary trajectory design algorithms, and seven reinforcement learning-based hybridizations. Experimental statistical results demonstrate that RL_HDE outperforms other competitors in terms of convergence efficiency and accuracy. RL_HDE has better performance for solving complex interplanetary trajectory design problems such as Cassini2 and Messenger-full.

AB Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are notorious for their poor performance in adverse conditions, leading to high sensitivity and low robustness. Due to the costly and time-consuming nature of creating extensive speech databases, addressing the issue of low robustness has become a prominent area of research, focusing on the synthetic generation of speech data using pre-existing natural speech. This paper examines the impact of standard data augmentation techniques, including pitch shift, time stretch, volume control, and their combination, on the accuracy of isolated-word ASR systems. The performance of three machine learning models, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), is analyzed on two Serbian corpora of isolated words. The Whi-Spe speech database in neutral phonation is utilized for augmentation and training, and a specifically developed Python-based software tool is employed for the augmentation process in this research study. The conducted experiments demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the Word Error Rate (WER) for the CNN-based recognizer on both testing datasets, achieved through a single augmentation technique based on pitch-shifting.

Aiming to contribute by adding monitoring criteria and complementing research in this field, to help maintenance teams project the future status of their power transformers immersed in insulating mineral oil with nominal voltages rated from 34.5 kV to 230 kV and above, with powers from tens to hundreds of MVA, and with and without on-load tap changer, this article presents an innovative method for projection the performance index of these assets on any given date, and to obtain a numerically reliability projection for that date. The originality of this tool stems from its combined use of two easy-to implement mathematical criteria, considering the historical results of current and previous maintenance dielectric and electrical tests: the Weighted Moving Average and the Consistency of the Historical Neighborhood. Thus, this method is expected to contribute to more accurate to decisions making by maintenance teams.

ID ROUTING PROTOCOL
AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is formed by a group of mobile and wireless nodes (cars, buses, trucks, etc), which can dynamically form a network to exchange information without the necessity of using a fixed network infrastructure. The performance of these networks is entirely dependent on the quality of the established routes. Several factors can influence route quality and network connectivity, for instance: speed, density, movement direction, and radio transmission range. Therefore, the design of VANET routing protocols has become an intriguing challengeable research topic. The newly introduced Improved Connectivity Ad Hoc On-Demand Multipath Distance Vector (IC_AOMDV) protocol uses vehicular density and movement direction (combined with the number of hops) to establish more stable and beneficial routes. Simulation results proved that IC_AOMDV can deliver good performance on the metrics packet delivery rate, average end-to-end delay and overhead, when compared to other well-known protocols. This paper brings new results on the statistical behavior of each parameter used in the IC_AOMDV route selection process and it shows that the most beneficial routes are only 20% to 30% longer when compared to those employed in the standard AOMDV protocol.

AB Zero-day vulnerabilities are undisclosed security flaws exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to vulnerable systems. Firewalls and antivirus software are essential for preventing intrusions. While firewalls monitor network traffic to prevent unauthorized access, they may struggle to filter all incoming traffic due to attacker-generated anomalies. We present a novel approach to automate the generation of dynamic firewall rules, aiming to address this challenge through the utilization of a custom software solution in conjunction with a suitable programming language. This approach autonomously maintains and updates firewall rules, bolstering network security and streamlining the identification and mitigation of zero-day vulnerabilities. We evaluated the approach on a simulated network, demonstrating its efficacy in detecting and preventing unauthorized access through zero-day attacks. Our automated method for dynamic firewall rule creation offers an efficient means to address zero-day vulnerabilities. It empowers businesses to safeguard against cyberattacks and protect sensitive data. With adaptability to changing network requirements, it is valuable for organizations of different scales. In conclusion, our proposed automated approach for dynamic firewall rule generation provides a scientifically validated solution to address zero-day vulnerabilities. It enhances security measures, defends against emerging threats, and enables businesses to protect their systems and data effectively.

AB We propose a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) architecture with a source, N one-way unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relays, and K destination users where the amplify-and-forward protocol is considered with the partial relay selection strategy. Then, we derive closed-form expressions for the bit error probability (BEP) of the NOMA users over the Rayleigh fading channel. This research investigated the selection of the nth best available UAV relay while presenting the bit error rate (BER) performance of a NOMA system. In addition, we analyze the diversity order and develop an asymptotic closed-form expression of the BEP in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. To verify the accuracy of the analytical study of BER, numerical results are also provided taking into account the number of UAV relays, path loss exponent, power allocation coefficient, and channel gains. Finally, we validate that the simulation results precisely match our proposed theoretical analysis.

AB Ensuring the safety, security, robustness, and fault tolerance of advanced robotic systems is essential for various fields, including healthcare, industry, and space. To address these issues, it is necessary to use software testing techniques and standards, similar to those applied in other safety-critical applications. The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a popular choice for developing robotic systems, so it is important to have specialized testing libraries and methods for it. In this study, a novel mutation testing library for ROS was developed and integrated it into the automated/tailored mutation-based software fault injection tool (IM-FIT). IM-FIT is an open-source automated software testing tool that is used to evaluate the software robustness of safety-critical systems using mutation-based tests. The proposed ROSMutation library mutates ROS-specific code snippets (publisher, subscriber, params, services, etc.) in the Python code within ROS-compatible software packages using IM-FIT. We evaluated the effectiveness of the ROSMutation library in two scenarios (basic and advanced), applying it to ROS-compatible code through IM-FIT and measuring its ability to assess the software robustness of ROS-compatible and Python-based software packages. The results showed that the ROSMutation library is effective in evaluating software robustness criteria for ROS-compatible and Python based software.

AB the increase in the number of devices using local and global networks has made it very challenging to manage network traffic, especially during epidemics and natural disasters. Traffic must be analyzed and routed efficiently while managing the network in these situations. The proposed approach focuses on effective routing by detecting elephant flows. In this study, the Deep Learning method has been utilized for elephant flow detection. In flow detection, 11 different features are extracted for each flow, and elephant flows are accurately detected. Additionally, the Grid Search method determines the parameters that yield the best results in classifying elephant and mice flows. As a result, elephant flows that have been classified are routed using the Discrete-Particle Optimization method, whereas mice flows are routed using traditional Round Robin or Random methods. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a high level of accuracy in detecting elephant flows and routing them effectively while also maintaining the overall network performance.

AB recently,smart cities have emerged as one of the most important global trends initiated by many countries. The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G connectivity enables numerous smart system technologies. One of the most critical aspects of smart cities is Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) which allow for accurate traffic forecasting. Existing traffic forecasting approaches use simple models based on univariate historical datasets or fuse historical traffic data with other datasets, such as air pollution records. These techniques interpreted traffic data points as independent samples despite their time dependency, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose an enhanced traffic prediction approach using the sliding window technique. The proposed approach transforms the traffic data points into time-series sequence data using the sliding window technique. Moreover, the proposed approach exploits traffic and pollution datasets for multivariate traffic prediction. The proposed approach compares different machine/deep learning techniques for prediction and evaluates their accuracy compared to a baseline benchmark. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the evaluation metrics values for the tested machine and deep learning techniques by an average value of 36% and 24%, respectively, compared to the base-line benchmark.

AB photovoltaic (PV) has become one of the most important renewable energy sources today. Getting the maximum power from these systems in changing environmental conditions is an important research subject. Maximum power point trackers (MPPT) are used to get the highest efficiency from PV arrays under current irradiance and temperature conditions. Additional hardware such as sensors, partial shading, and complex algorithms are factors affecting MPPT performance. The MPPT method proposed in this study does not require any additional hardware, has a simple algorithm, is easy to implement and can extract maximum power from the PV array even under partial shading conditions. In the proposed method, firstly, the electrical characteristic of the PV array is obtained by emulating the dc-dc converter as a load. The maximum power point of the array was found using the current and voltage data during this process. Subsequently, the PV array was operated at this point and the maximum power was harvested. The proposed method was validated on the Matlab-Simulink environment by simulating various irradiance values.

AB With the rapid development of the Internet and information technology, people are able to create multimedia data such as pictures or videos anytime and anywhere. Efficient multimedia processing tools are needed for the vast video data. The video moment localization task aims to locate the video moment which best matches the query in the untrimmed video. Existing text-guided methods only consider single-scale text features, which cannot fully represent the semantic features of text, and also do not consider the masking of crucial information in the video by text information when using text to guide the extraction of video features. To solve the above problems, we propose a video moment localization network based on text multi-semantic clues guidance. Specifically, we first design a text encoder based on fusion gate to better capture the semantic information in the text through multi-semantic clues composed of word embedding, local features and global features. Then text guidance module guides the extraction of video features by text semantic features to highlight the video features related to text semantics. Experimental results on two datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions, show that our approach provides significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

AB While the handling for temporally-varying linear equation (TVLE) has received extensive attention, most methods focused on trading off the conflict between computational precision and convergence rate. Different from previous studies, this paper proposes two complete adaptive zeroing neural dynamics (ZND) schemes, including a novel adaptive continuous ZND (ACZND) model, two general variable time discretization techniques, and two resultant adaptive discrete ZND (ADZND) algorithms, to essentially eliminate the conflict. Specifically, an error-related varying-parameter ACZND model with global and exponential convergence is first designed and proposed. To further adapt to the digital hardware, two novel variable time discretization techniques are proposed to discretize the ACZND model into two ADZND algorithms. The convergence properties with respect to the convergence rate and precision of ADZND algorithms are proved via rigorous mathematical analyses. By comparing with the traditional discrete ZND (TDZND) algorithms, the superiority of ADZND algorithms in convergence rate and computational precision is shown theoretically and experimentally. Finally, simulative experiments, including numerical experiments on a specific TVLE solving as well as four application experiments on arm path following and target motion positioning are successfully conducted to substantiate the efficacy, superiority, and practicability of ADZND algorithms.

AB This study presents hybrid particle swarm optimization with quasi-Newton (HPSO-QN), a hybrid optimization method for accurately identifying mechanical parameters in two-mass model (2MM) systems. These systems are commonly used to model and control high-performance electric drive systems with elastic joints, which are prevalent in modern industrial production. The proposed method combines the global exploration capabilities of particle swarm optimization (PSO) with the local exploitation abilities of the quasi-Newton (QN) method to precisely estimate the motor and load inertias, shaft stiffness, and friction coefficients of the 2MM system. By integrating these two optimization techniques, the HPSO-QN method exhibits superior accuracy and performance compared to standard PSO algorithms. Experimental validation using a 2MM system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately identifying and improving the mechanical parameters of these complex systems. The HPSO-QN method offers significant implications for enhancing the modeling, performance, and stability of 2MM systems and can be extended to other systems with flexible shafts and couplings. This study contributes to the development of accurate and effective parameter identification methods for complex systems, emphasizing the crucial role of precise parameter estimation in achieving optimal control performance and stability.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that causes brain cells to degenerate, resulting in decreased physical and mental abilities and, in severe cases, permanent memory loss. It is considered as the most common and fatal form of dementia. Although mild cognitive impairment (MCI) precedes Alzheimer's disease (AD), it does not necessarily show the obvious symptoms of AD. As a result, it becomes challenging to distinguish between mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of deep learners based on convolutional neural networks for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The proposed approach utilises simple averaging ensemble and weighted averaging ensemble methods. The ensemble-based transfer learning model demonstrates enhanced generalization and performance for AD diagnosis compared to traditional transfer learning methods. Extensive experiments on the OASIS-3 dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.

AB Integration of technology within problem-based learning curricula is expanding; however, information regarding student experiences and attitudes about the integration of such technologies is limited. This study aimed to evaluate pre-clinical medical student perceptions and use patterns of the "Road to Birth" (RtB) software, a novel program designed to support human maternal anatomy and physiology education. Second-year medical students at a large midwestern American university participated in a prospective, mixed-methods study. The RtB software is available as a mobile smartphone/tablet application and in immersive virtual reality. The program was integrated into problem-based learning activities across a three-week obstetrics teaching period. Student visuospatial ability, weekly program usage, weekly user satisfaction, and end-of-course focus group interview data were obtained. Survey data were analyzed and summarized using descriptive statistics. Focus group interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. Of the eligible students, 66% (19/29) consented to participate in the study with 4 students contributing to the focus group interview. Students reported incremental knowledge increases on weekly surveys (69.2% week one, 71.4% week two, and 78.6% week three). Qualitative results indicated the RtB software was perceived as a useful educational resource; however, its interactive nature could have been further optimized. Students reported increased use of portable devices over time and preferred convenient options when using technology incorporated into the curriculum. This study identifies opportunities to better integrate technology into problem-based learning practices in medical education. Further empirical research is warranted with larger and more diverse student samples.

AB This paper proposes a spatial-temporal recurrent neural network architecture for deep Q-networks that can be used to steer an autonomous ship. The network design makes it possible to handle an arbitrary number of surrounding target ships while offering robustness to partial observability. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art collision risk metric is proposed to enable an easier assessment of different situations by the agent. The COLREG rules of maritime traffic are explicitly considered in the design of the reward function. The final policy is validated on a custom set of newly created singleship encounters called 'Around the Clock' problems and the commonly used Imazu (1987) problems, which include 18 multi-ship scenarios. Performance comparisons with artificial potential field and velocity obstacle methods demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach for maritime path planning. Furthermore, the new architecture exhibits robustness when it is deployed in multi-agent scenarios and it is compatible with other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, including actor-critic frameworks. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fast and efficient algorithms optimized for high performance computers are crucial for the real-time analysis of data in heavy-ion physics experiments. Furthermore, the application of neural networks and other machine learning techniques has become more popular in physics experiments over the last years. For that reason, a fast neural network package called ANN4FLES is developed in C++, which will be optimized to be used on a high performance computer farm for the future Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR, Darmstadt, Germany). This paper describes the first application of ANN4FLES used in the reconstruction chain of the CBM experiment to replace the existing particle competition between Ks-mesons and ?-hyperons in the KF Particle Finder by a neural network based approach. The raw classification performance of the neural network reaches over 98% on the testing set. Furthermore, it is shown that the background noise was reduced by the neural network-based competition and therefore improved the quality of the physics analysis.

TI Machine-Learning Techniques for Predicting Phishing Attacks in

AB Security in the blockchain has become a topic of concern because of the recent developments in the field. One of the most common cyberattacks is the so-called phishing attack, wherein the attacker tricks the miner into adding a malicious block to the chain under genuine conditions to avoid detection and potentially destroy the entire blockchain. The current attempts at detection include the consensus protocol; however, it fails when a genuine miner tries to add a new block to the blockchain. Zero-trust policies have started making the rounds in the field as they ensure the complete detection of phishing attempts; however, they are still in the process of deployment, which may take a significant amount of time. A more accurate measure of phishing detection involves machine-learning models that use specific features to automate the entire process of classifying an attempt as either a phishing attempt or a safe attempt. This paper highlights several models that may give safe results and help eradicate blockchain phishing attempts.

AB Industrial projects are plagued by uncertainties, often resulting in both time and cost overruns. This research introduces an innovative approach, employing Reinforcement Learning (RL), to address three distinct project management challenges within a setting of uncertain activity durations. The primary objective is to identify stable baseline schedules. The first challenge encompasses the multimode lean project management problem, wherein the goal is to maximize a project's value function while adhering to both due date and budget chance constraints. The second challenge involves the chance-constrained critical chain buffer management problem in a multimode context. Here, the aim is to minimize the project delivery date while considering resource constraints and duration-chance constraints. The third challenge revolves around striking a balance between the project value and its net present value (NPV) within a resource-constrained multimode environment. To tackle these three challenges, we devised mathematical programming models, some of which were solved optimally. Additionally, we developed competitive RL-based algorithms and verified their performance against established benchmarks. Our RL algorithms consistently generated schedules that compared favorably with the benchmarks, leading to higher project values and NPVs and shorter schedules while staying within the stakeholders' risk thresholds. The potential beneficiaries of this research are project managers and decision-makers who can use this approach to generate an efficient frontier of optimal project plans.

Numerical methods based on sum-of-squares decomposition or algebraic methods based on quantifier elimination are used. Starting from Lyapunov's direct method, these methods can be used to derive conditions for the automatic verification of Lyapunov functions as well as for the structural determination of control laws. This contribution describes methods for the automatic verification of (control) Lyapunov functions as well as for the constructive determination of control laws.

AB Data visualization is critical to unraveling hidden information from complex and high-dimensional data. Interpretable visualization methods are critical, especially in the biology and medical fields, however, there are limited effective visualization methods for large genetic data. Current visualization methods are limited to lower-dimensional data and their performance suffers if there is missing data. In this study, we propose a literature-based visualization method to reduce high-dimensional data without compromising the dynamics of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and textual interpretability. Our method is innovative because it is shown to (1) preserves both global and local structures of SNP while reducing the dimension of the data using literature text representations, and (2) enables interpretable visualizations using textual information. For performance evaluations, we examined the proposed approach to classify various classification categories including race, myocardial infarction event age groups, and sex using several machine learning models on the literature-derived SNP data. We used visualization approaches to examine clustering of data as well as quantitative performance metrics for the classification of the risk factors examined above. Our method outperformed all popular dimensionality reduction and visualization methods for both classification and visualization, and it is robust against missing and higher-dimensional data. Moreover, we found it feasible to incorporate both genetic and other risk information obtained from literature with our method.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Domain Adaptive Few-Shot Learning (DA-FSL) aims at accomplishing few-shot classification tasks on a novel domain with the aid of a large number of source-style samples and several target-style samples. It is essential for DA-FSL to transfer task knowledge from the source domain to the target domain and overcome the asymmetry amount of labeled data in both domains. To this end, we propose Dual Distillation Discriminator Networks (D3Net) from the perspective of the lack of labeled target domain style samples in DA-FSL. Specifically, we employ the idea of distillation discrimination to avoid the over-fitting caused by the unequal number of samples in the target and source domains, which trains the student discriminator by the soft labels from the teacher discriminator. Meanwhile, we design the task propagation stage and the mixed domain stage respectively from the level of feature space and instances to generate more target-style samples, which apply the task distributions and the sample diversity of the source domain to enhance the target domain. Our D3Net realizes the distribution alignment between the source domain and the target domain and constraints the FSL task distribution by prototype distributions on the mixed domain. Extensive experiments on three DA-FSL benchmark datasets, i.e., mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, and DomainNet, demonstrate that our D3Net achieves competitive performance. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The backpropagation algorithm has promoted the rapid development of deep learning, but it relies on a large amount of labeled data and still has a large gap with how humans learn. The human brain can quickly learn various conceptual knowledge in a self-organized and unsupervised manner, accomplished through coordinating various learning rules and structures in the human brain. Spiketiming-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a general learning rule in the brain, but spiking neural networks (SNNs) trained with STDP alone is inefficient and perform poorly. In this paper, taking inspiration from short-term synaptic plasticity, we design an adaptive synaptic filter and introduce the adaptive spiking threshold as the neuron plasticity to enrich the representation ability of SNNs. We also introduce an adaptive lateral inhibitory connection to adjust the spikes balance dynamically to help the network learn richer features. To speed up and stabilize the training of unsupervised spiking neural networks, we design a samples temporal batch STDP (STB-STDP), which updates weights based on multiple samples and moments. By integrating the above three adaptive mechanisms and STB-STDP, our model greatly accelerates the training of unsupervised spiking neural networks and improves the performance of unsupervised SNNs on complex tasks. Our model achieves the current state-of-the-art performance of unsupervised STDP-based SNNs in the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets. Further, we tested on the more complex CIFAR10 dataset, and the results fully illustrate the superiority of our algorithm. Our model is also the first work to apply unsupervised STDP-based SNNs to CIFAR10. At the same time, in the small-sample learning scenario, it will far exceed the supervised ANN using the same structure. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper studies the target model with the help of auxiliary models from different but possibly re-lated groups. Inspired by transfer learning, we propose a method called joint estimation transferred from strata (JETS). To obtain a sparse solution, JETS constructs a penalized framework combining a term that penalizes the target model and an additional term that penalizes the differences between auxiliary mod-els and the target model. In this way, JETS overcomes the challenge caused by the limited samples in high-dimensional study, and obtains stable and accurate estimates regardless of whether auxiliary sam-ples contain noisy information. We demonstrate that this method enjoys the computational advantage of the traditional methods such as the lasso. During simulations and applications, the proposed method is compared with several existing methods and JETS outperforms others.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos' workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller's control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels. The code used is available at Link.

ID IMPACTS
AB Electric and autonomous aircraft (EAA) are set to disrupt current cargo-shipping models. To maximize the benefits of this technology, investors and logistics managers need information on target commodities, service location establishment, and the distribution of origin-destination pairs within EAA's range limitations. This research introduces a three-phase data-mining and geographic information system (GIS) algorithm to support data-driven decision-making under uncertainty. Analysts can modify and expand this workflow to scrutinize origin-destination commodity flow datasets representing various locations. The algorithm identifies four commodity categories contributing to more than one-third of the value transported by aircraft across the contiguous United States, yet only 5% of the weight. The workflow highlights 8 out of 129 regional locations that moved more than 20% of the weight of those four commodity categories. A distance band of 400 miles among these eight locations accounts for more than 80% of the transported weight. This study addresses a literature gap, identifying opportunities for supply chain redesign using EAA. The presented methodology can guide planners and investors in identifying prime target markets for emerging EAA technologies using regional datasets.

AB In this article, we analyze the spread of information on social media (Twitter) and purpose a strategy based on epidemiological models. It is well known that social media represent a strong tool to spread news and, in particular, fake news, due to the fact that they are free and easy to use. First, we propose an algorithm to create a proper dataset in order to employ the ignorants-spreaders-recovered epidemiological model. Then, we show that to use this model to study the diffusion of real news, parameter estimation is required. We show that it is also possible to accurately predict the evolution of news spread and its peak in terms of the maximum number of people who share it and the time when the peak occurs trough a process of data reduction, i.e., by using only a part of the built dataset to optimize parameters. Numerical results based on the analysis of real news are also provided to confirm the applicability of our proposed model and strategy.

AB Reinforcement learning has been used on a variety of control tasks for drones, including, in previous work at the University of Bristol, on perching manoeuvres with sweep-wing aircraft. In this paper, a new aircraft model is presented representing flight up to very high angles of attack where the aerodynamic models are highly nonlinear. The model is employed to develop high-alpha manoeuvres, using reinforcement learning to exploit the nonlinearities at the edge of the flight envelope, enabling fixed-wing operations in tightly confined spaces. Training networks for multiple manoeuvres is also demonstrated. The approach is shown to generate controllers that take full advantage of the aircraft capability. It is suggested that a combination of these neural network-based controllers, together with classical model predictive control, could be used to operate efficiently within the low alpha flight regime and, yet, respond rapidly in confined spaces where high alpha, agile manoeuvres are required.

AB Hub-and-Spoke (H & S) network modeling is a form of transport topology optimization in which network joins are connected through intermediate hub nodes. The Short Sea Shipping (SSS) problem aims to efficiently disperse passenger flows involving multiple vessel routes and intermediary hubs through which passengers are transferred to their final destination. The problem contains elements of the Hub-and-Spoke and Travelling Salesman, with different levels of passenger flows among islands, making it more demanding than the typical H & S one, as the hub selection within nodes and the shortest routes among islands are internal optimization goals. This work introduces a multi-objective tri-level optimization algorithm for the General Network of Short Sea Shipping (GNSSS) problem to reduce travel distances and transportation costs while improving travel quality and user satisfaction, mainly by minimizing passenger hours spent on board. The analysis is performed at three levels of decisions: (a) the hub node assignment, (b) the island-to-line assignment, and (c) the island service sequence within each line. Due to the magnitude and complexity of the problem, a genetic algorithm is employed for the implementation. The algorithm performance has been tested and evaluated through several real and simulated case studies of different sizes and operational scenarios. The results indicate that the algorithm provides rational solutions in accordance with the desired sub-objectives. The multi-objective consideration leads to solutions that are quite scattered in the solution space, indicating the necessity of employing formal optimization methods. Typical Pareto diagrams present non-dominated solutions varying at a range of 30 percent in terms of the total distance traveled and more than 50 percent in relation to the cumulative passenger hours. Evaluation results further indicate satisfactory algorithm performance in terms of result stability (repeatability) and computational time requirements. In conclusion, the work provides a tool for assisting network operation and transport planning decisions by shipping companies in the directions of cost reduction and traveler service upgrade. In addition, the model can be adapted to other applications in transportation and in the supply chain.

AB This article is devoted to the problem of determining the rational amount of spare parts in the warehouse of a service center of an automobile manufacturer's branded network used for maintenance and current repairs. This problem was solved on the basis of the accumulated statistical data of failures that occurred during the warranty period of vehicle operation. In the calculation, game methods were used. This took into account the stochastic need for spare parts and the consequences of their presence or absence in stock, which are expressed in the form of a profit and an additional possible payment of a fine in case of a discrepancy between the current level of demand for spare parts and the available spare parts. Two cases of decision making are considered: under conditions of risk and uncertainty, the occurrence of which depends on the amount of information about the input flow of enters to the service center. If such statistics are accumulated, then the decision is made taking into account the possible risk associated with the uncertainty of a specific need for spare parts. Otherwise, the probability of a particular need is calculated on the basis of special criteria. To optimize the collection of information about the state of warehouse stocks, the transfer of information, and the assessment and forecasting of stocks, well-organized feedback is needed, which is shown in the form of an algorithm.

AB An algorithm is presented for the construction of an asymptotic approximation of a stable stationary solution to a diffusion equation system in a two-dimensional domain with a smooth boundary and a source function that is discontinuous along some smooth curve lying entirely inside the domain. Each of the equations contains a small parameter as a factor in front of the Laplace operator, and as a result, the system is singularly perturbed. In the vicinity of the curve, the solution of the system has a large gradient. Such a problem statement is used in the model of urban development in metropolitan areas. The discontinuity curves in this model are the boundaries of urban biocenoses or large water pools, which prevent the spread of urban development. The small parameter is the ratio of the city's outskirts linear size to the whole metropolis linear size. The algorithm includes the construction of an asymptotic approximation to a solution with a large gradient at the media interface as well as the steps for obtaining the existence conditions. To prove the existence and stability theorems, we use the upper and lower solutions, which are constructed as modifications of the asymptotic approximation to the solution. The latter is constructed using the Vasil'yeva algorithm as an expansion of a small parameter exponent.

AB Bees, like other insects, indirectly contribute to job creation, food security, and poverty reduction. However, across many parts of the world, bee populations are in decline, affecting crop yields due to reduced pollination and ultimately impacting human nutrition. Technology holds promise for countering the impacts of human activities and climatic change on bees' survival and honey production. However, considering that smart beekeeping activities mostly operate in remote areas where the use of grid power is inaccessible and the use of batteries to power is not feasible, there is thus a need for such systems to be energy efficient. This work explores the integration of device-to-device communication with 5G technology as a solution to overcome the energy and throughput concerns in smart beekeeping technology. Mobile-based device-to-device communication facilitates devices to communicate directly without the need of immediate infrastructure. This type of communication offers advantages in terms of delay reduction, increased throughput, and reduced energy consumption. The faster data transmission capabilities and low-power modes of 5G networks would significantly enhance the energy efficiency during the system's idle or standby states. Additionally, the paper analyzes the application of both the discovery and communication services offered by 5G in device-to-device-based smart bee farming. A novel, energy-efficient algorithm for smart beekeeping was developed using data integration and data scheduling and its performance was compared to existing algorithms. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed smart beekeeping device-to-device communication with data integration guarantees a good quality of service while enhancing energy efficiency.

AB Manufacturing companies face a significant challenge when developing their master production schedule, navigating unforeseen disruptions during daily operations. Moreover, fluctuations in demand pose a substantial risk to scheduling and are the main cause of instability and uncertainty in the system. To address these challenges, employing flexible systems to mitigate uncertainty without incurring additional costs and generate sustainable responses in industrial applications is crucial. This paper proposes a product-driven system to complement the master production plan generated by a mathematical model. This system incorporates intelligent agents that make production decisions with a function capable of reducing uncertainty without significantly increasing production costs. The agents modify or determine the forecasted production quantities for each cycle or period. In the case study conducted, a master production plan was established for 12 products over a one-year time horizon. The proposed solution achieved an 11.42% reduction in uncertainty, albeit with a 2.39% cost increase.

AB Occlusion problem refers to the challenge of accurately tracking blocked or occluded objects. It occurs when mul-tiple objects are moving nearby or overlapping with each other in the scene. Despite its frequent occurrence in multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks, occlusion is often overlooked by researchers. This paper proposes a simple and effective method to partially solve the occlusion problems of multi-object tracking by developing the Partner Mining Module (PMM) and the Partner Updating Module (PUM). The PMM module mines the space relationship between objects, and the PUM module uses the relationship obtained by the PMM module to update lost tracklets' positions. Importantly, these two modules can be integrated into existing data association-based multi-object tracking methods without any additional training expenses. Furthermore, this study proposes novel methods for computing measurement uncertainty to enhance trajectory accuracy. Experiments conducted on MOT16 and MOT17 datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed modules. Integration of PMM and PUM into original methods substantially enhances the IDF1 score by 1 point.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For greater efficiency, human-machine and human-robot interactions must be designed with the idea of multimodality in mind. To allow the use of several interaction modalities, such as the use of voice, touch, gaze tracking, on several different devices (computer, smartphone, tablets, etc.) and to integrate possible connected objects, it is necessary to have an effective and secure means of communication between the different parts of the system. This is even more important with the use of a collaborative robot (cobot) sharing the same space and very close to the human during their tasks. This study present research work in the field of multimodal interaction for a cobot using the MQTT protocol, in virtual (Webots) and real worlds (ESP microcontrollers, Arduino, IOT2040). We show how MQTT can be used efficiently, with a common publish/subscribe mechanism for several entities of the system, in order to interact with connected objects (like LEDs and conveyor belts), robotic arms (like the Ned Niryo), or mobile robots. We compare the use of MQTT with that of the Firebase Realtime Database used in several of our previous research works. We show how a "pick-wait-choose-and place" task can be carried out jointly by a cobot and a human, and what this implies in terms of communication and ergonomic rules, via health or industrial concerns (people with disabilities, and teleoperation).

AB Although graph representation learning has been studied extensively in static graph settings, dynamic graphs are less investigated in this context. This paper proposes a novel integrated variational framework called DYnamic mixture Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (DyVGRNN), which consists of extra latent random variables in structural and temporal modelling. Our proposed framework comprises an integration of Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) and Graph Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN) by exploiting a novel attention mechanism. The Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the VGAE framework are combined in DyVGRNN to model the multimodal nature of data, which enhances performance. To consider the significance of time steps, our proposed method incorporates an attention-based module. The experimental results demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art dynamic graph representation learning methods in terms of link prediction and clustering.1 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

   Anisotropic message passing
AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with naive message passing mechanisms have limited performance due to the isotropic aggregation strategy. To remedy this drawback, some recent works focus on how to design anisotropic aggregation strategies with tricks on feature mapping or structure mining. However, these models still suffer from the low ability of expressiveness and long-range modeling for the needs of high performance in practice. To this end, this paper proposes a tree-guided anisotropic GCN, which applies an anisotropic aggregation strategy with competitive expressiveness and a large receptive field. Specifically, the anisotropic aggregation is decoupled into two stages. The first stage is to establish the path of the message passing on a tree-like hypergraph consisting of substructures. The second one is to aggregate the messages with constrained intensities by employing an effective gating mechanism. In addition, a novel anisotropic readout mechanism is constructed to generate representative and discriminative graph-level features for downstream tasks. Our model outperforms baseline methods and recent works on several synthetic benchmarks and datasets from different real world tasks. In addition, extensive ablation studies and theoretical analyses indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB EEG is widely adopted to study the brain and brain computer interface (BCI) for its non-invasiveness and low costs. Specifically EEG can be applied to differentiate brain states, which is important for better understanding the working mechanisms of the brain. Recurrent neural network (RNN)-based learning strategy has been widely utilized to differentiate brain states, because its optimization architectures improve the classification performance for differentiating brain states at the group level. However, present classification performance is still far from satisfactory. We have identified two major focal points for improvements: one is about organizing the input EEG signals, and the other is related to the design of the RNN architecture. To optimize the above-mentioned issues and achieve better brain state classification performance, we propose a novel multi-clip random fragment strategybased interactive bidirectional recurrent neural network (McRFS-IBiRNN) model in this work. This model has two advantages over previous methods. First, the McRFS component is designed to reorganize the input EEG signals to make them more suitable for the RNN architecture. Second, the IBiRNN component is an innovative design to model the RNN layers with interaction connections to enhance the fusion of bidirectional features. By adopting the proposed model, promising brain states classification performances are obtained. For example, 96.97% and 99.34% of individual and group level four-category classification accuracies are successfully obtained on the EEG motor/imagery dataset, respectively. A 99.01% accuracy can be observed for four-category classification tasks with new subjects not seen before, which demonstrates the generalization of our proposed method. Compared with existing methods, our model outperforms them with superior results. Overall, the proposed McRFS-IBiRNN model demonstrates great superiority in differentiating brain states on EEG signals & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting objects in challenging illumination conditions is critical for autonomous driving. Existing solutions detect objects with standard or tone-mapped Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial approach that jointly optimizes tone-mapping (mapping High Dynamic Range (HDR) to LDR) and object detection. We analyze different ways to combine the feedback from tone-mapping quality and object detection quality for training such an adversarial network. We show that our deep tone-mapping operator jointly trained with an object detector achieves the best tone-mapping quality as well as detection quality compared to alternative approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most existing person re-identification algorithms prioritize the extraction of effective and salient local features while neglecting the affinity between local and adjacent features. This phenomenon will cause misidentification when different people have similar local features. To address this issue, we introduce the AEA-Net, which emphasizes the affinity between the local features of a single image. Specifically, three important components are proposed. The affinity-supervised attention module (ASA) centers on adjacent features and utilizes the affinity between global and adjacent features to supervise the learning of attention. The affinity relationship module (AR) focuses on constructing relationship features between local and adjacent features to enhance the closeness between local features. The tangle hybrid loss (THL) makes the final predictions have a distinct weight profile. Extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FEASIBLE SOLUTION
AB The Transportation Problem (TP) is a special type of linear programming problem, where the objective is to minimize the cost of distributing a product from a number of sources to a number of destinations. Many methods for solving the TP have been studied over time. However, exact methods do not always succeed in finding the optimal solution or a solution that effectively approximates the optimal one. This paper introduces two new variations of the well-established Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm named the Trigonometric Acceleration Coefficients-PSO (TrigAc-PSO) and the Four Sectors Varying Acceleration Coefficients PSO (FSVAC-PSO) and applies them to solve the TP. The performances of the proposed variations are examined and validated by carrying out extensive experimental tests. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed PSO variations, thirty two problems with different sizes have been solved to evaluate and demonstrate their performance. Moreover, the proposed PSO variations were compared with exact methods such as Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM), the Total Differences Method 1 (TDM1), the Total Opportunity Cost Matrix-Minimal Total (TOCM-MT), the Juman and Hoque Method (JHM) and the Bilqis Chastine Erma method (BCE). Last but not least, the proposed variations were also compared with other PSO variations that are well known for their completeness and efficiency, such as Decreasing Weight Particle Swarm Optimization (DWPSO) and Time Varying Acceleration Coefficients (TVAC). Experimental results show that the proposed variations achieve very satisfactory results in terms of their efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing either exact or heuristic methods.

AB In this study, we propose a population-based, data-driven intelligent controller that leverages neural-network-based digital twins for hypothesis testing. Initially, a diverse set of control laws is generated using genetic programming with the digital twin of the system, facilitating a robust response to unknown disturbances. During inference, the trained digital twin is utilized to virtually test alternative control actions for a multi-objective optimization task associated with each control action. Subsequently, the best policy is applied to the system. To evaluate the proposed model predictive control pipeline, experiments are conducted on a multi-mode heat transfer test rig. The objective is to achieve homogeneous cooling over the surface, minimizing the occurrence of hot spots and energy consumption. The measured variable vector comprises high dimensional infrared camera measurements arranged as a sequence (655,360 inputs), while the control variable includes power settings for fans responsible for convective cooling (3 outputs). Disturbances are induced by randomly altering the local heat loads. The findings reveal that by utilizing an evolutionary algorithm on measured data, a population of control laws can be effectively learned in the virtual space. This empowers the system to deliver robust performance. Significantly, the digital twin-assisted, population-based model predictive control (MPC) pipeline emerges as a superior approach compared to individual control models, especially when facing sudden and random changes in local heat loads. Leveraging the digital twin to virtually test alternative control policies leads to substantial improvements in the controller's performance, even with limited training data.

AB The purpose of this study is to show how machine learning can be leveraged as a tool to govern social impact and drive fair and equitable investments. Many organizations today are establishing financial inclusion goals to promote social impact and have been increasing their investments in this space. Financial inclusion is the opportunity for individuals and businesses to have access to affordable financial products including loans, credit, and insurance that they may otherwise not have access to with traditional financial institutions. Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending serves as a platform that can support and foster financial inclusion and influence social impact and is becoming more popular today as a resource to underserved communities. Loans issued through P2P lending can fund projects and initiatives focused on climate change, workforce diversity, women's rights, equity, labor practices, natural resource management, accounting standards, carbon emissions, and several other areas. With this in mind, AI can be a powerful governance tool to help manage risks and promote opportunities for an organization's financial inclusion goals. In this paper, we explore how AI, specifically machine learning, can help manage the P2P platform Kiva's investment risks and deliver impact, emphasizing the importance of prediction model retraining to account for regulatory and other changes across the P2P landscape to drive better decision-making. As part of this research, we also explore how changes in important model variables affect aggregate model predictions.

AB Modeling the spread of infections in networks is a well-studied and important field of research. Most infection and diffusion models require a real value or probability at the edges of the network as an input, but this is rarely available in real-life applications. The Generalized Inverse Infection Model (GIIM) has previously been used in real-world applications to solve this problem. However, these applications were limited to the specifics of the corresponding case studies, and the theoretical properties, as well as the wider applicability of the model, are yet to be investigated. Here, we show that the general model works with the most widely used infection models and is able to handle an arbitrary number of observations on such processes. We evaluate the accuracy and speed of the GIIM on a large variety of realistic infection scenarios.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Freight forwarding and transportation are the backbone of the modern economy. There are thousands of transportation companies on the market whose sole purpose is to deliver ordered goods from pickup to delivery. Transportation can be carried out by two types of fleets. A company can have its own trucks, or it can use third-party companies. This transportation can be carried out in a variety of formulas, with full truckload being the most common for long routes. The shipper must be aware of the potential cost of such a service during the process of selecting a particular transport. The presented solution addresses this exact issue. There are many approaches, ranging from detailed cost calculators to machine learning solutions. The present study uses a dedicated hybrid algorithm that combines different techniques, spanning clustering algorithms, regression and kNN (k Nearest Neighbors) estimators. The resulting solution was tested on real shipping data covering multi-year contract data from several shipping companies operating in the European market. The obtained results proved so successful that they were implemented in a commercial solution used by freight forwarding companies on a daily basis.

When compared under the same conditions with other SI algorithms, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) stands out. First, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) parameters to be optimized are selected, and then each SI optimization algorithm is executed within an off-line simulation. Once the UKF initialization parameters P-0, Q(0), and R-0 are obtained, they are applied in real-time in the decentralized neural block control (DNBC) scheme for the trajectory tracking task of a 2-DOF robot manipulator. Finally, the results are compared according to the criteria performance evaluation using each algorithm, along with CPU cost.

AB In this study, we propose the use of virtual urban field studies (VUFS) through context-based interface prototypes for evaluating the interaction design of auditory interfaces. Virtual field tests use mixed-reality technologies to combine the fidelity of real-world testing with the affordability and speed of testing in the lab. In this paper, we apply this concept to rapidly test sound designs for autonomous vehicle (AV)-pedestrian interaction with a high degree of realism and fidelity. We also propose the use of psychometrically validated measures of presence in validating the verisimilitude of VUFS. Using mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, we analysed users' perceptions of presence in our VUFS prototype and the relationship to our prototype's effectiveness. We also examined the use of higher-order ambisonic spatialised audio and its impact on presence. Our results provide insights into how VUFS can be designed to facilitate presence as well as design guidelines for how this can be leveraged.

AB Educators and students have shown significant interest in the potential for generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to support student learning outcomes, for example, by offering personalized experiences, 24 h conversational assistance, text editing and help with problem-solving. We review contemporary perspectives on the value of AI as a tool in an educational context and describe our recent research with undergraduate students, discussing why and how we integrated OpenAI tools ChatGPT and Dall-E into the curriculum during the 2022-2023 academic year. A small cohort of games programming students in the School of Computing and Digital Media at London Metropolitan University was given a research and development assignment that explicitly required them to engage with OpenAI. They were tasked with evaluating OpenAI tools in the context of game development, demonstrating a working solution and reporting on their findings. We present five case studies that showcase some of the outputs from the students and we discuss their work. This mode of assessment was both productive and popular, mapping to students' interests and helping to refine their skills in programming, problem-solving, critical reflection and exploratory design.

AB With the widespread of Monkeypox and increase in the weekly reported number of cases, it is observed that this outbreak continues to put the human beings in risk. The early detection and reporting of this disease will help monitoring and controlling the spread of it and hence, supporting international coordination for the same. For this purpose, the aim of this paper is to classify three diseases viz. Monkeypox, Chikenpox and Measles based on provided image dataset using trained standalone DL models (InceptionV3, EfficientNet, VGG16) and Squeeze and Excitation Network (SENet) Attention model. The first step to implement this approach is to search, collect and aggregate (if require) verified existing dataset(s). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper which has proposed the use of SENet based attention models in the classification task of Monkeypox and also targets to aggregate two different datasets from distinct sources in order to improve the performance parameters. The unexplored SENet attention architecture is incorporated with the trunk branch of InceptionV3 (SENet+InceptionV3), EfficientNet (SENet+EfficientNet) and VGG16 (SENet+VGG16) and these architectures improve the accuracy of the Monkeypox classification task significantly. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets depict that the proposed work achieves considerably high results with regard to accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score and hence, improving the overall performance of classification. Thus, the proposed research work is advantageous in enhanced diagnosis and classification of Monkeypox that can be utilized further by healthcare experts and researchers to confront its outspread.

AB The increasing popularity of cruise tourism has led to the need for effective planning and management strategies to enhance the city tour experience for cruise passengers. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based planner specifically designed to optimize city tours for cruise passengers. By leveraging the power of DRL, the proposed planner aims to maximize the number of visited attractions while considering constraints such as time availability, attraction capacities, and travel distances. The planner offers an intelligent and personalized approach to city tour planning, enhancing the overall satisfaction of cruise passengers and minimizing the negative impacts on the city's infrastructure. An experimental evaluation was conducted considering Naples's fourteen most attractive points of interest. Results show that, with 30 state variables and more than 19*1012 possible states to be explored, the DRL-based planner converges to an optimal solution after only 20,000 learning steps.

AB Hand gestures are an essential part of human-to-human communication and interaction and, therefore, of technical applications. The aim is increasingly to achieve interaction between humans and computers that is as natural as possible, for example, by means of natural language or hand gestures. In the context of human-machine interaction research, these methods are consequently being explored more and more. However, the realization of natural communication between humans and computers is a major challenge. In the field of hand gesture recognition, research approaches are being pursued that use additional hardware, such as special gloves, to classify gestures with high accuracy. Recently, deep learning techniques using artificial neural networks have been increasingly proposed for the problem of gesture recognition without using such tools. In this context, we explore the approach of convolutional neural network (CNN) in detail for the task of hand gesture recognition. CNN is a deep neural network that can be used in the fields of visual object processing and classification. The goal of this work is to recognize ten types of static hand gestures in front of complex backgrounds and different hand sizes based on raw images without the use of extra hardware. We achieved good results with a CNN network architecture consisting of seven layers. Through data augmentation and skin segmentation, a significant increase in the model's accuracy was achieved. On public benchmarks, two challenging datasets have been classified almost perfectly, with testing accuracies of 96.5% and 96.57%.

AB The Bundle Enrichment Method (BEM-DC) is introduced for solving nonsmooth difference of convex (DC) programming problems. The novelty of the method consists of the dynamic management of the bundle. More specifically, a DC model, being the difference of two convex piecewise affine functions, is formulated. The (global) minimization of the model is tackled by solving a set of convex problems whose cardinality depends on the number of linearizations adopted to approximate the second DC component function. The new bundle management policy distributes the information coming from previous iterations to separately model the DC components of the objective function. Such a distribution is driven by the sign of linearization errors. If the displacement suggested by the model minimization provides no sufficient decrease of the objective function, then the temporary enrichment of the cutting plane approximation of just the first DC component function takes place until either the termination of the algorithm is certified or a sufficient decrease is achieved. The convergence of the BEM-DC method is studied, and computational results on a set of academic test problems with nonsmooth DC objective functions are provided.

AB A new random forest-based model for solving the Multiple Instance Learning problem under small tabular data, called the Soft Tree Ensemble Multiple Instance Learning, is proposed. A new type of soft decision trees is considered, which is similar to the well-known soft oblique trees, but with a smaller number of trainable parameters. In order to train the trees, it is proposed to convert them into neural networks of a specific form, which approximate the tree functions. It is also proposed to aggregate the instance and bag embeddings (output vectors) by using the attention mechanism. The whole Soft Tree Ensemble Multiple Instance Learning model, including soft decision trees, neural networks, the attention mechanism and a classifier, is trained in an end-to-end manner. Numerical experiments with well-known real tabular datasets show that the proposed model can outperform many existing multiple instance learning models. A code implementing the model is publicly available.

AB Partial shading conditions lead to power mismatches among photovoltaic (PV) panels, resulting in the generation of multiple peak power points on the P-V curve. At this point, conventional MPPT algorithms fail to operate effectively. This research work mainly focuses on the exploration of performance optimization and harnessing more power during the partial shading environment of solar PV systems with a single-objective non-linear optimization problem subjected to different operations formulated and solved using recent metaheuristic algorithms such as Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and the proposed Chimp Optimization algorithm (ChOA). This research work is implemented on a test system with the help of MATLAB/SIMULINK, and the obtained results are discussed. From the overall results, the metaheuristic methods used by the trackers based on their analysis showed convergence towards the global Maximum Power Point (MPP). Additionally, the proposed ChOA technique shows improved performance over other existing algorithms.

AB One of the primary objectives of truss structure design optimization is to minimize the total weight by determining the optimal sizes of the truss members while ensuring structural stability and integrity against external loads. Trusses consist of pin joints connected by straight members, analogous to vertices and edges in a mathematical graph. This characteristic motivates the idea of representing truss joints and members as graph vertices and edges. In this study, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is employed to exploit the benefits of graph representation and develop a GNN-based surrogate model integrated with a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to approximate nodal displacements of trusses during the design optimization process. This approach enables the determination of the optimal cross-sectional areas of the truss members with fewer finite element model (FEM) analyses. The validity and effectiveness of the GNN-based optimization technique are assessed by comparing its results with those of a conventional FEM-based design optimization of three truss structures: a 10-bar planar truss, a 72-bar space truss, and a 200-bar planar truss. The results demonstrate the superiority of the GNN-based optimization, which can achieve the optimal solutions without violating constraints and at a faster rate, particularly for complex truss structures like the 200-bar planar truss problem.

AB Grammatical Evolution is a Genetic Programming variant which evolves problems in any arbitrary language that is BNF compliant. Since its inception, Grammatical Evolution has been used to solve real-world problems in different domains such as bio-informatics, architecture design, financial modelling, music, software testing, game artificial intelligence and parallel programming. Multi-output problems deal with predicting numerous output variables simultaneously, a notoriously difficult problem. We present a Multi-Genome Grammatical Evolution better suited for tackling multi-output problems, specifically digital circuits. The Multi-Genome consists of multiple genomes, each evolving a solution to a single unique output variable. Each genome is mapped to create its executable object. The mapping mechanism, genetic, selection, and replacement operators have been adapted to make them well-suited for the Multi-Genome representation and the implementation of a new wrapping operator. Additionally, custom grammar syntax rules and a cyclic dependency-checking algorithm have been presented to facilitate the evolution of inter-output dependencies which may exist in multi-output problems. Multi-Genome Grammatical Evolution is tested on combinational digital circuit benchmark problems. Results show Multi-Genome Grammatical Evolution performs significantly better than standard Grammatical Evolution on these benchmark problems.

AB Recently, a hypothesis providing a detailed equation for the Plantower CF_1 algorithm for PM2.5 has been published. The hypothesis was originally validated using eight independent Plantower sensors in four PurpleAir PA-II monitors providing PM2.5 estimates from a single site in 2020. If true, the hypothesis makes important predictions regarding PM2.5 measurements using CF_1. Therefore, we test the hypothesis using 18 Plantower sensors from four datasets from two sites in later years (2021-2023). The four general models from these datasets agreed to within 10% with the original model. A competing algorithm known as "pm2.5 alt" has been published and is freely available on the PurpleAir API site. The accuracy, precision, and limit of detection for the two algorithms are compared. The CF_1 algorithm overestimates PM2.5 by about 60-70% compared to two calibrated PurpleAir monitors using the pm2.5 alt algorithm. A requirement that the two sensors in a single monitor agree to within 20% was met by 85-99% of the data using the pm2.5 alt algorithm, but by only 22-74% of the data using the CF_1 algorithm. The limit of detection (LOD) of the CF_1 algorithm was about 10 times the LOD of the pm2.5 alt algorithm, resulting in 71% of the CF_1 data falling below the LOD, compared to 1 % for the pm2.5 alt algorithm.

TI P3DC-shot: Prior-driven discrete data calibration for nearest-neighbor
   few-shot classification
SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING

DE Few-shot learning; Image classification; Prototype; Calibration
ID NETWORKS
AB Nearest-Neighbor (NN) classification has been proven as a simple and effective approach for few-shot learning. The query data can be classified efficiently by finding the nearest support class based on features extracted by pre-trained deep models. However, NN-based methods are sensitive to the data distribution and may produce false prediction if the samples in the support set happen to lie around the distribution boundary of different classes. To solve this issue, we present P3DC-shot, an improved nearest-neighbor based few-shot classification method empowered by prior-driven data calibration. Inspired by the distribution calibration technique which utilizes the distribution or statistics of the base classes to calibrate the data for few-shot tasks, we propose a novel discrete data calibration operation which is more suitable for NN-based few-shot classification. Specifically, we treat the prototypes representing each base class as priors and calibrate each support data based on its similarity to different base prototypes. Then, we perform NN classification using these discretely calibrated support data. Results from extensive experiments on various datasets show our efficient non-learning based method can outperform or at least comparable to SOTA methods which need additional learning steps.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, several robotic end-effectors have been developed and made available in the market. Nevertheless, their adoption in industrial context is still limited due to a burdensome integration, which strongly relies on customized software modules specific for each end-effector. Indeed, to enable the functionalities of these end-effectors, dedicated interfaces must be developed to consider the different end-effector characteristics, like finger kinematics, actuation systems, and communication protocols. To face the challenges described above, we present ROS End-Effector, an open-source framework capable of accommodating a wide range of robotic end-effectors of different grasping capabilities (grasping, pinching, or independent finger dexterity) and hardware characteristics. The ROS End-Effector framework, rather than controlling each end-effector in a different and customized way, allows to mask the physical hardware differences and permits to control the end-effector using a set of high-level grasping primitives automatically extracted. By leveraging on hardware agnostic software modules including hardware abstraction layer (HAL), application programming interfaces (APIs), simulation tools and graphical user interfaces (GUIs), ROS End-Effector effectively facilitates the integration of diverse end-effector devices. The proposed framework capabilities in supporting different robotics end-effectors are demonstrated in both simulated and real hardware experiments using a variety of end-effectors with diverse characteristics, ranging from under-actuated grippers to anthropomorphic robotic hands. Finally, from the user perspective, the manuscript provides a set of examples about the use of the framework showing its flexibility in integrating a new end-effector module.

AB Redundant and dual-arm manipulators exhibit good flexibility and excellent cooperation ability, respectively. Therefore, both these manipulators are used to design a redundant dual-chain manipulator with two kinematic chains and a fixed base. In addition, a motion planning method is proposed using a manifold analysis based on the characteristics of this designed manipulator to resolve the difficulty associated with motion planning for a dual-chain manipulator under multiple constraints. Firstly, the paths of the two end-effectors of the dual-chain manipulator are planned synchronously by the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) in the Cartesian space. Then, joint trajectories that correspond to the paths are generated by the manifold analysis in the joint space. In this method, the manifold continuity constraint is added to the end-effector path planning of RRT* to ensure that the planned paths have continuous joint trajectories. The joint trajectories are optimised by analysing the performance of the manipulator on the manifolds to improve their motion performance. The prototype experiments of loose coordination and tight coordination are provided in the experimental section; these experiments prove the feasibility and practicability of the motion planning method proposed in this study.

AB Vision impairment affects an individual's quality of life, posing challenges for visually impaired people (VIPs) in various aspects such as object recognition and daily tasks. Previous research has focused on developing visual navigation systems to assist VIPs, but there is a need for further improvements in accuracy, speed, and inclusion of a wider range of object categories that may obstruct VIPs' daily lives. This study presents a modified version of YOLOv4_Resnet101 as backbone networks trained on multiple object classes to assist VIPs in navigating their surroundings. In comparison to the Darknet, with a backbone utilized in YOLOv4, the ResNet-101 backbone in YOLOv4_Resnet101 offers a deeper and more powerful feature extraction network. The ResNet-101's greater capacity enables better representation of complex visual patterns, which increases the accuracy of object detection. The proposed model is validated using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset. Image pre-processing techniques are employed to enhance the training process, and manual annotation ensures accurate labeling of all images. The module incorporates text-to-speech conversion, providing VIPs with auditory information to assist in obstacle recognition. The model achieves an accuracy of 96.34% on the test images obtained from the dataset after 4000 iterations of training, with a loss error rate of 0.073%.

AB This paper presents a device that converts sound wave frequencies into colors to assist people with hearing problems in solving accessibility and communication problems in the hearing-impaired community. The device uses a precise mathematical apparatus and carefully selected hardware to achieve accurate conversion of sound to color, supported by specialized automatic processing software suitable for standardization. Experimental evaluation shows excellent performance for frequencies below 1000 Hz, although limitations are encountered at higher frequencies, requiring further investigation into advanced noise filtering and hardware optimization. The device shows promise for various applications, including education, art, and therapy. The study acknowledges its limitations and suggests future research to generalize the models for converting sound frequencies to color and improving usability for a broader range of hearing impairments. Feedback from the hearing-impaired community will play a critical role in further developing the device for practical use. Overall, this innovative device for converting sound to color represents a significant step toward improving accessibility and communication for people with hearing challenges. Continued research offers the potential to overcome challenges and extend the benefits of the device to a variety of areas, ultimately improving the quality of life for people with hearing impairments.

TI Semi-automatic muscle segmentation in MR images using deep

   Deep registration
AB Fully automated approaches based on convolutional neural networks have shown promising performances on muscle segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images, but still rely on an extensive amount of training data to achieve valuable results. Muscle segmentation for pediatric and rare diseases cohorts is therefore still often done manually. Producing dense delineations over 3D volumes remains a timeconsuming and tedious task, with significant redundancy between successive slices. In this work, we propose a segmentation method relying on registration-based label propagation, which provides 3D muscle delineations from a limited number of annotated 2D slices. Based on an unsupervised deep registration scheme, our approach ensures the preservation of anatomical structures by penalizing deformation compositions that do not produce consistent segmentation from one annotated slice to another. Evaluation is performed on MR data from lower leg and shoulder joints. Results demonstrate that the proposed semi-automatic multi-label segmentation model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFIERS
AB Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has been widely and successfully used in learning coherent latent repre-sentation of data. However, the lack of interpretability in the latent space constructed by the VAE under the prior distribution is still an urgent problem. This paper proposes a VAE with understandable concept embedding named Cloud-VAE, which constructs interpretable latent space by disentangling the latent variables and considering their uncertainty based on cloud model. Firstly, cloud model-based clustering algorithm cast initial constraint of latent space into a prior distribution of concept which can be em-bedded into the latent space of the VAE to disentangle the latent variables. Secondly, reparameterization trick based on forward cloud transformation algorithm is designed to estimate the latent space concept by increasing the randomness of latent variables. Furthermore, variational lower bound of Cloud-VAE is derived to guide the training process to construct concepts of latent space, realizing the mutual mapping between latent space and concept space. Finally, experimental results on 6 benchmark datasets show that Cloud-VAE has good clustering and reconstruction performance, which can explicitly explain the aggre-gation process of the model and discover more interpretable disentangled representations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Focusing on the time-varying meshing performance assessment and recognition, a new computer aided design/ computer aided manufacturing/ computer aided engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) integration-based digital visualization of local bearing contact recognition is developed for non-orthogonal aviation spiral bevel gears. At first, universal tooth flank modeling and its CAD/CAM software development are developed to get a closed-form solution to the whole tooth flank points. Then, with applications of an improved digital kinematics arrangements, digital virtual assembly in CAD software is proposed for time-varying meshing simulation. To distinguish with the conventional loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA), a digital deformation layering method is developed to show local bearing contact at each time-varying deformation layer. Where, accurate search for the loaded meshing points is developed by using the improved dichotomy iteration method. Moreover, instantaneous contact ellipse in software development is determined by chord intercept method. CAD/CAM/CAE integrationbased digital visualization is performed by correlating with sensitive assembly error driven virtual simulation. Finally, the given numerical instance can verify the proposed method.

AB This paper presents a novel approach utilizing uniform rectangular arrays to design a constant-beamwidth (CB) linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer, which also improves white noise gain and directivity. By employing a generalization of the convolutional Kronecker product beamforming technique, we decompose a physical array into virtual subarrays, each tailored to achieve a specific desired feature, and we subsequently synthesize the original array's beamformer. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully achieves the desired beamforming characteristics while maintaining favorable levels of white noise gain and directivity. A comparative analysis against existing methods from the literature reveals that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods.

AB This paper focuses on the joint estimation of parameters and time delays for multi-input systems that contain unknown input delays and colored noise. A greedy pursuit hierarchical iteration algorithm is proposed, which can reduce the estimation cost. Firstly, an over-parameterized approach is employed to construct a sparse system model of multi-input systems even in the absence of prior knowledge of time delays. Secondly, the hierarchical principle is applied to replace the unknown true noise items with their estimation values, and a greedy pursuit search based on compressed sensing is employed to find key parameters using limited sampled data. The greedy pursuit search can effectively reduce the scale of the system model and improve the identification efficiency. Then, the parameters and time delays can be estimated simultaneously while considering the known orders and found locations of key parameters by utilizing iterative methods with limited sampled data. Finally, some simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented algorithm in this paper.

AB The recognition of human activities using vision-based techniques has become a crucial research field in video analytics. Over the last decade, there have been numerous advancements in deep learning algorithms aimed at accurately detecting complex human actions in video streams. While these algorithms have demonstrated impressive performance in activity recognition, they often exhibit a bias towards either model performance or computational efficiency. This biased trade-off between robustness and efficiency poses challenges when addressing complex human activity recognition problems. To address this issue, this paper presents a computationally efficient yet robust approach, exploiting saliency-aware spatial and temporal features for human action recognition in videos. To achieve effective representation of human actions, we propose an efficient approach called the dual-attentional Residual 3D Convolutional Neural Network (DA-R3DCNN). Our proposed method utilizes a unified channel-spatial attention mechanism, allowing it to efficiently extract significant human-centric features from video frames. By combining dual channel-spatial attention layers with residual 3D convolution layers, the network becomes more discerning in capturing spatial receptive fields containing objects within the feature maps. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive experiments on four well-established benchmark datasets for human action recognition. The quantitative results obtained validate the efficiency of our method, showcasing significant improvements in accuracy of up to 11% as compared to state-of-the-art human action recognition methods. Additionally, our evaluation of inference time reveals that the proposed method achieves up to a 74x improvement in frames per second (FPS) compared to existing approaches, thus showing the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed DA-R3DCNN for real-time human activity recognition.

AB The performance of photovoltaic (PV) system relies on the accurate determination of unknown parameters in PV models, such as photo-generated current, diode current, and resistance. These unknown parameters may vary with different temperature and irradiance conditions, which greatly increases the difficulty of identifying these unknown parameters. Although some parameter identification methods have been proposed to solve such a problem, the accuracy and reliability of solutions obtained by these methods suffers from great challenges when temperature and irradiance are changing. In this paper, a simple and effective approach called success-history adaptation differential evolution with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) and decomposition referred as (L-SHADED), is presented to accurately and reliably identify the unknown parameters of PV models under different temperature and irradiance. In L-SHADED, firstly, an unknown parameters decomposition technique is used to reduce the complexity of the problem. Then an advanced evolutionary algorithm L-SHADE is employed to identify the optimal unknown parameter values. The performance of proposed L-SHADED has been investigated by testing two single-diode-based PV modules (multi-crystalline KC200GT and monocrystalline SM55) under different temperature and irradiance. The experimental comparison results demonstrate that proposed L-SHADED is almost 10 times smaller in RMSE than other methods. Furthermore, the coefficient of determination of L-SHADED reaches 1.0 in almost all conditions, which indicates that the parameters identified by L-SHADED are quite accurate. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Existing deep neural networks for brain tumor segmentation from multimodal MRIs rely predominantly on standard segmentation architectures, overlooking the underlying rules in clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a novel deep multimodal network that architecturally mimics these rules and fully replicates the process of manually annotating brain tumors by human experts in machines. Three significant manual annotation rules are mimicked. The three sub-tasks are introduced first to segment three regions sequentially. We incorporate a fine-grained modality attention module in each sub-task to mimic region-aware multimodal fusion. Finally, we propose the deep feature propagation module for multi-scale context exploitation and repurpose deep cascaded attention for location information exploitation. These exploits imitate earlier segmentation knowledge exploitation. We use a new curriculum loss to train the nested network and a stratified training approach to reduce the intramodality domain shift caused by the dataset's distribution. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets: BraTS2018, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020. The Dice similarity coefficient on Brats2020 is 0.800,0.930 and 0.857 for enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively, ranking sixth top among 285 participating methods. These findings suggest the potential applicability of our approach in brain tumor segmentation from multimodal MRIs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision, but can be deceived by carefully crafted adversarial images. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based adversarial attack against CNNs trained on ImageNet. Our EA-based attack aims to generate adversarial images that not only achieve a high confidence probability of being classified into the target category (at least 75%), but also appear indistinguishable to the human eye in a black-box setting. These constraints are implemented to simulate a realistic adversarial attack scenario. Our attack has been thoroughly evaluated on 10 CNNs in various attack scenarios, including high-confidence targeted, good -enough targeted, and untargeted. Furthermore, we have compared our attack favorably against other well-known white-box and black-box attacks. The experimental results revealed that the proposed EA-based attack is superior or on par with its competitors in terms of the success rate and the visual quality of the adversarial images produced.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID HEURISTIC ALGORITHM; FLEXIBLE FLOWSHOP
AB In many hybrid flow shop production environments, dynamic events (DEs) often occur and seriously impact production schedules. However, the traditional model rarely considers DEs, which makes the model seriously inconsistent with the actual situation. In addition, to reduce carbon emissions, there is an urgent need to carry out green optimization scheduling of production workshops, especially in emerging digital workshops. First, this paper proposes a dynamic digital-twin-based Multi-Objective Hybrid Flowshop Green Scheduling Model with DEs (MOHFGSM-DEs) to fill the above gaps. The MOHFGSM-DEs model's bi-objectives are the makespan minimization and digital workshop total en-ergy consumption minimization. In addition, the MOHFGSM-DEs model takes account of representative DEs in the actual dynamic production process, including controlled processing time, device dynamic reconfiguration events, and workpiece reworking events, which makes it more adaptive in practical production. Secondly, an Adaptive Multi-Objective Dynamic Harris Hawks Optimizer (AMODHHO) is presented with DEs parameters perceived by the digital twin of the workshop, adjusting the scheduling scheme adaptively in real time to address the MOHFGSM-DEs model efficiently. AMODHHO combines a nonlinear optimization strategy on balancing the exploration and exploitation of Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) and introduces the crossover operator of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve its optimal global ability. Moreover, a digital-twin-driven dynamic encoding methodology containing many optimization strategies is designed based on problem-specific characteristics. Finally, numerical experiments and application case comparisons are performed among AMODHHO, SPEA2, and NSGA-II. Results show that AMODHHO is superior to SPEA2 and NSGA-II regarding comprehensive performance. Therefore, the proposed model and AMODHHO are feasible to solve the real-world MOHFGSM-DEs adaptively. Furthermore, it performs dynamic adaptive adjustment for the actual scheduling schemes according to the real-time DEs the digital twin perceives. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precise forecasts of railway container demand is crucial for railway infrastructure construction and daily operations management. Nevertheless, temporal variations in railway container traffic are subject to a diversity of factors, and such dynamics are therefore extremely difficult to capture in forecasts. Decomposing the temporal data into a number of subseries with distinct qualities is a prevalent technique for reducing the complexity of data. Yet, a few of sub-series resulted from such decomposition tend to remain irregular and unstable. In this study, a novel secondary decomposition-ensemble method is proposed for railroad container volume forecasting. Specifically, CEEDMAN and VMD are employed successively to decompose the time series into various components. The sub-series are processed by different models, according to their distinct features, to yield their respective independent predictions, which are then ensembled to give the final railway container traffic forecast. Additionally, we incorporate the DEEPAR model for interval predictions, providing valuable uncertainty information that assists decision-makers in preparing for potential challenges. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to other benchmark models, even in the presence of disruptive events such as the big epidemic. We further validate the applicability and robustness of the proposed method by incorporating an additional dataset with a finer-time data. Our findings contribute to the field of railway container demand forecasting and offer practical insights for decision-makers in the railway industry.

A dynamic conditional score model is constructed to analyze and extract statistical characteristic parameters of a time series to calculate the autocorrelation value of the parameter series. A weighted fuzzy C-mean clustering analysis is performed, and the obtained data weight information is used as input for incremental clustering to improve the clustering accuracy. The DCS model parameter dataset and data weight information are combined, and the clustering analysis of the consumer power load data stream is performed. The power load time series of different companies is given, and the clustering validity indices are defined for the performance analysis to verify the proposed clustering algorithm.

AB Information has been an essential element in the development of collaborative and cooperative frameworks. From decision making to the attainment of different goals, people have been relatively adept at making judgments about the trustworthiness of information, based on knowledge and understanding of a normative model of information. However, recent events, for example, in elections and referenda, have stretched the ability of people to be able to measure the integrity and trustworthiness of information online. The result has been an erosion of trust in information online, its source, its value, and the ability to help one determine the trustworthiness of a piece of information. The situation is made more complex by social networks since social media have made the spread of (potentially untrustworthy) information more accessible and faster. We believe that this has exacerbated the need to assist humans in their judgment of the trustworthiness of information. In this work, we present a social cognitive construct: a trust model for information. We present our trust model, which we incorporate into an application to highlight misleading information, with the experimental result on users' perception of the working of the model. Finally, we highlight the challenges faced in this research and future work.

AB We enable an autonomous agent (robot) to share its artificial mind, particularly its conscious content, with its audiences like humans or other agents. This effort is relying on the studies from cognitive modeling and supports the autonomous human robot interaction. LIDA is a biologically inspired systems-level cognitive model that explains and predicts how minds work. This model has been used in designing the controllers of intelligent autonomous agents. Here we propose to add a new description (sub) model into LIDA, allowing its agents to share their control structures, the artificial minds. We argue that the cognitive representations and processes introduced in LIDA may naturally serve as the source of the mind contents an agent can express out. We also proposed a type of description behavior based on LIDA's action modules, which support the interactions between the agent and its real-world environments including human audiences. Through this description model, an agent's mind will be more visible and accessible, so the agent's intelligence can be assessed from not only its outside appearance and behaviors, but also its mind. In addition, the agent's mind activities may associate with, so help explain certain behaviors it acted/acts. This helps the agent earn more understanding from its audiences so to being accepted by and engage to its living society better. Finally, as an agent's controller, LIDA is designed heavily relying on the hypotheses of human minds, so its agent's artificial mind contents are conceptually easy to understand to its human audiences.

AB This article proposes a novel design methodology for circular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns, combining a large experimental database, an artificial neural network, and the balancing-composite-motionoptimization algorithm. First, the experimental database consisting of 1245 compression tests was compiled from the available literature, involving five input parameters: cross-sectional outer diameter, thickness of steel tube, length of column, yield strength of steel and cylindrical compressive strength of concrete, and one output variable: the measured axial capacity of columns. Second, the artificial neural network model was trained and validated using that database, in combination with various error measurement criteria: mean-squared-error, mean-absolute-error, and coefficient of determination. The optimization problem to find the optimal design of circular CFST columns was then formulated as a function of material cost and the geometrical parameters of the cross-section. Finally, balancing-composite-motion-optimization was employed to solve the aforementioned nonlinear optimization problem. The proposed model's performance was compared with the widely used standards EC4, AISC, and DBJ, especially for scenarios exceeding the limitations of individual material strengths. Results showed that the proposed equation exhibited the best predictive performance. For practical application, we have derived an explicit prediction equation and implemented it in Excel, a user-friendly interface (the Excel file is appended to this paper). Thus, the proposed method in this study can assist existing codes in finding the optimal design of CFST columns, as the current standards have limitations as to the characteristic strength of the materials.

DE Complex values; fine-grained visual classification (FGVC); graph

AB Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is challenging due to the interclass similarity and intraclass variation in datasets. In this work, we explore the great merit of complex values in introducing an imaginary part for modeling data uncertainty (e.g., different points on the complex plane can describe the same state) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in learning interdependently among classes to simultaneously tackle the above two major challenges. To the end, we propose a novel approach, termed text-assisted complex-valued fusion network (TA-CFN). Specifically, we expand each feature from 1-D real values to 2-D complex value by disassembling feature maps, thereby enabling the extension of traditional deep convolutional neural networks over the complex domain. Then, we fuse the real and imaginary parts of complex features through complex projection and modulus operation. Finally, we build an undirected graph over the object labels with the assistance of a text corpus, and a GCN is learned to map this graph into a set of classifiers. The benefits are in two folds: 1) complex features allow for a richer algebraic structure to better model the large variation within the same category and 2) leveraging the interclass dependencies brought by the GCN to capture key factors of the slight variation among different categories. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that our proposed model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on two widely used FGVC datasets.

AB Deep-learning models have enabled performance leaps in analysis of high-dimensional functional MRI (fMRI) data. Yet, many previous methods are suboptimally sensitive for contextual representations across diverse time scales. Here, we present BolT, a blood-oxygen-level-dependent transformer model, for analyzing multi-variate fMRI time series. BolT leverages a cascade of transformer encoders equipped with a novel fused window attention mechanism. Encoding is performed on temporally-overlapped windows within the time series to capture local representations. To integrate information temporally, cross-window attention is computed between base tokens in each window and fringe tokens from neighboring windows. To gradually transition from local to global representations, the extent of window overlap and thereby number of fringe tokens are progressively increased across the cascade. Finally, a novel cross-window regularization is employed to align high-level classification features across the time series. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of BolT against state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, explanatory analyses to identify landmark time points and regions that contribute most significantly to model decisions corroborate prominent neuroscientific findings in the literature.

AB Positron emission tomography (PET) has been widely used in nuclear medicine to diagnose cancer. PET images suffer from degradation because of the scanner's physical limitations, the radiotracer's reduced dose, and the acquisition time. In this work, we propose a residual three-dimensional (3D) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance sinograms acquired from a small-animal PET scanner. The network comprises three convolutional layers created with 3D filters of sizes 9, 5, and 5, respectively. For training, we extracted 15250 3D patches from low-and high-count sinograms to build the low-and high-resolution pairs. After training and prediction, the image was reconstructed from the enhanced sinogram using the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The results revealed that the proposed network improves the spillover ratio by up to 4.5% and the uniformity by 55% compared to the U-Net. The NEMA phantom data were obtained in a simulation environment. The network was tested on acquired real data from a mouse. The reconstructed images and the profiles of maximum intensity projection show that the proposed method visually yields sharper images. 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of pilot models has been a long-standing interest in cognitive modeling and AI due to the potential gains they offer in aerial robotics. In this study, a cognitive and embodied fighter pilot model is developed to obtain pilot-like characteristics for making high-level decisions in air-to-air engagements, using spiking neurons in ensembles implemented in the Neural Engineering Objects (NENGO) framework (Bekolay et al., 2014; Eliasmith, 2015). One major problem that is faced when creating such complex decision models is factoring the effect of the human agent's affective state into the model, where emotional aggression may lead to irrational decisions. To address this need, inputs representing affective states that can influence the other subnetworks were included in the model. The NENGO framework also allowed for the use of Semantic Pointers, which allowed the numerical outputs of the spiking neuron ensembles to be expressed verbally as a semantic output. The inputs, final outputs (decisions), and intermediary decisions of the model were then evaluated by real-life warfighter pilots to assess the accuracy and validity of the model.

DT Article
DE Mirroring; Telecommunicative dialogue; Emotion recognition
AB In this work we investigate the phenomenon of emotional mirroring using remotely diagnosed dynamic parameters of facial expressions. The research is based on the fact that mirroring is the subconscious adjustment and copying of the dynamics of another person. We considered a reflection of face expression as a reproduction of emotions of one person by another. To obtain this behavior we used an induced cognitive-emotional conflict in the process of telecommunication dialogue. The conflict was initiated by a psychologist or by short videoclips with surprise endings. Since the communication in a telecommunication form limits non-verbal information about the interlocutor with respect to the normal dialogue, we have also investigated the hypothesis of whether the phenomenon of mirroring is detectable in such conditions. We developed a computer program using VGG16-based artificial neural network to mark people's emotional reactions in video data automatically. The processed material consisted of 24 interview recordings with the participants of both genders and three qualified expert psychologists. We used different types of interviews: interviews based on self-attitude techniques, problematic interviews based on transactional analysis, free reasoning about controversial and topical situations. The communication topics were selected with respect to the age and other indicators of the group of participants. It was found that the parameters of facial expressions of the participant and the experimenter (psychologist) identified by the program strongly correlate with emotions such as happiness, sadness and surprise. Notable negative correlations were found between the parameters of the happiness of participant and fear of psychologist, sad of the participant and happiness of the psychologist, sad of psychologist and surprise of the participant. A direct relationship between sad of participant and fear of psychologist was detected. All of the identified correlations appear both in the situation with and without cognitive-emotional conflict. However, the degree of their manifestation was quite different for these two cases.

AB In certain Multi-Attribute Group Decision-Making (MAGDM) approaches an aggregation of decision-making matrices of experts' evaluations/ratings of possible alternatives by their attributes into an etalon decision-making matrix is an important task. Based on possible great experience and deep knowledge of the subject, the expert tries to dominate other experts in the decision-making process. Besides, every expert has a possibility of a certain degree to influence on the decision-making process. In such cases experts' evaluations aggregation into an etalon matrix by the additive or linear aggregation instruments is unacceptable. We present a new two-stage MAGDM approach to solve this task. On the first stage: In the evidence theory environment the connection between experts' pair interaction indexes and possibility levels of their influence on decision-making process is constructed. For this, a Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm is created, the result of which is the estimated class of associated probabilities of the possibility distribution. Experts' evaluations in decision-making matrixes are represented by the q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (q-ROFNs). Before aggregation of experts' data into an etalon decision-making matrix, evaluations are transformed into discrimination q-rung picture linguistic numbers (q-RPLNs). New definitions are introduced for the Score and Accuracy functions of the q-rung picture linguistic numbers. q-rung picture linguistic numbers contain as well quantitative as qualificative information on experts' reflections on objects, while discrimination q-rung picture linguistic numbers describe interactive phenomena between arguments. Based on constructed possibility distribution on the experts' group, the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) and Choquet averaging (CA) aggregation operators under q-rung picture linguistic environment are extended (q-RPLOWA and q-RPLCA, respectively). By the q-RPLOWA and q-RPLCA operators decision-making matrices of experts' evaluations/ratings are condensed into an etalon decision-making matrix. On the second stage: The concept of Euclidean distance and the entropy of De Luca-Termini are defined for q-rung picture linguistic set. The new relative closeness parameter for the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach under q-rung picture linguistic information is also defined. The technique for the TOPSIS approach for the ranking of possible alternatives in MAGDM by aggregating discrimination q-rung picture linguistic data of etalon matrix is developed. For illustration of the obtained results, Educational Programs Efficiency Evaluation problem is considered. Our constructed MAGDM approach complies with the principle of expertise in educational programs evaluation commission. The numerical results obtained for the q-RPLNs environment and the ranking of alternatives are compared with the numerical results and the ranking of alternatives obtained by the same approach for the initial expert data in q-ROFNs environment. A comparison with the results obtained by other existing methods is given.

AB Because of the frequent occurrence of chronic diseases, the COVID-19 pandemic, etc., online health expert question-answering (HQA) services have been unable to cope with the rapidly increasing demand for online consultations. Building a virtual health assistant based on medical named entity recognition (NER) can effectively assist with the consultation process, but the unstandardized expressions within HQA text pose a serious challenge for medical NER tasks. The main goal of this study is to propose a novel deep medical NER approach based on a collaborative decision strategy (CDS), i.e., co_decision_NER (CDN), that can identify standard and nonstandard medical entities in the HQA context. We collected 10,000 question-answer pairs from HaoDF, extracted medical entities from 15 entity categories, and used a CDS to fuse the advantages of different NER models. Ultimately, CDN achieved a performance (precision = 84.50%, recall = 84.30%, F1 = 84.40%) that was significantly better than that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method. Our empirical analysis suggests that the entity types Disease (DIS), Sign (SIG), Test (TES), Drug (DRU), Surgery (SUR), Precaution (PRE), and Region (REG) can be most easily expressed arbitrarily in the doctor-patient interaction scenario of HQA services. In addition, CDN can identify not only standard but also nonstandard medical entities, effectively alleviating the severe out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem faced by HQA services when performing medical NER tasks. The core contribution of this study is the development of a novel neural network model fusion algorithm that can improve the performance of entity recognition in medical domain-specific tasks.

AB The technology for identifying birds around power towers using cameras alone is still susceptible to environmental interference. This paper proposes a new bird damage recognition network, RCVNet, which addresses this issue by fusing radio-frequency (RF) images and visual images. The network employs a feature layer fusion approach that accurately identifies bird damages in the monitoring area. Initially, RCVNet takes a group of RF and visual images as input. Then, through a series of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), birds are identified and located. To overcome challenges in recognizing small targets, several improved modules such as crosssupervised fusion network (CSF-net), posture deformable convolution (PDF), small-target attention fusion mechanism (SAFM), and Tiny-YOLOHead are introduced throughout RCVNet, improving surface information utilization and small feature retention rates. Finally, a bird damage discrimination strategy is developed based on the recognition outcomes of birds. As there is currently no public dataset available for RCVNet training, a new bird dataset called CRB2022, which includes RF and visual images, was gathered. Through large-scale experiments utilizing these methods, RCVNet effectively identifies birds, achieving a mean average precision of 79.34% and a mean average recall of 83.29%. Additionally, the discrimination rate of the utilized strategy can reach up to 98%.

AB The online world and associated information and communication technologies have generated digital networks by processing massive volumes of data and have a significant impact on the environmental sustainability. Mobile Crowd Source (MCS) is one of the digital technologies that can help humanity to better sense, understand and protect the environment by using vast amounts of data obtained to construct intelligent decision support systems (DSS). However, as the false data submitted by dishonest and malicious workers will cause the data-based DSSs to make wrong decisions and thus cause great harm, it is an urgent issue to propose an effective Truth Data Discovery (TDD) scheme for MCS. To tackle this issue, a Reinforcement Learning-based Truth Data Discovery (RLTD) scheme is proposed to obtain truth data in MCS at low cost in this paper. The main innovations of the RLTD scheme are as follows: (1) A novel trustworthiness-based TDD scheme is proposed to obtain truth data accurately at low cost, which can facilitate data-based DSSs in MCS. (2) Combined with Matrix Factorization (MF), we propose a worker recruitment method that only needs to recruit & thetasym;n (& thetasym; & LE; 1) workers for TDD in n tasks, which reduces the data collection cost significantly than previous TDD schemes. (3) We propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Site Selection (RLSS) method that intelligently selects as few sites as possible for worker recruitment with guaranteed high data quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the RLTD scheme can improve the accuracy of data collection by 1.31%-21.02%, reduce the data collection cost by 81.39%-85.50% compared to the traditional TDD schemes, and identify workers with accuracy of 86.67%-94.58%.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes a novel load-shedding strategy that assures adequate voltage stability margin in post-load-shedding conditions. Minimum numbers of buses are selected for load shedding based on the incremental voltage of the load buses. An objective function has been formed that is to be minimized based on inequality constraints on load bus voltage and line flow. This objective function is the weighted sum of the slope of the PV-curve of the weakest bus, transmission losses, and the total load shed amount, which has been normalized with respect to the pre-load shed condition. A modified Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) has been used to obtain optimal load shed. The developed methodology has been implemented on standard IEEE 14 and 25-bus test systems, and comparisons based on statistical inferences have been carried out with the Sine-Cosine, Jaya, and Self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) algorithms. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper describes an extension of a safety culture within hospital organizations providing more transparency and acknowledgement of all actors, and in particular the parents. It contributes a model architecture to support a hospital to develop such an extended safety culture. It is illustrated for prevention of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is a commonly known consequence of childbirth for both mothers and fathers. In this research, we computationally analyze the risk factors and lack of support received by fathers. Therefore, we use shared mental models to model the effects of poor and additional communication by healthcare practitioners to mitigate the development of postpartum depression in both the mother and the father. Both individual mental models and shared mental models are considered in the design of the computational model. The paper illustrates the benefits of simple support in terms of communication during childbirth, which has lasting effects, even outside the hospital. For the impact of additional communication, a Virtual Safety Coach is designed that intervenes when necessary to provide support, i.e., when a health care practitioner doesn't. Moreover, organizational learning is also modelled to improve the mental models of both the Safety Coach and the Health Care Practitioner.

AB The current learning approach for smooth dendrite morphological neurons (DMNs) determines dendrite parameters using k-means clustering, which is non-reproducible due to its stochastic nature, risking falling into local minima. To overcome this issue, we introduce a DMN learning approach based on a deterministic hierarchical clustering method, which builds a linkage tree for each class of patterns. In ad-dition, a micro genetic algorithm automatically tunes the cut-off points in the linkage trees hierarchy to create suitable clusters of dendrites. The classification experiments consider 40 real-world datasets. The proposed approach outperforms three DMN models in classification performance and is quite competitive with a hybrid morphological-linear perceptron, multilayer perceptron, random forest, and support vector machine. Therefore, the proposed method is a suitable alternative for pattern classification applications.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Faults during operation of a system can occur at any time. Contemporary fault diagnosis systems focus on identifying the problem. However, when faults occur, the system has already incurred losses, either as rejects or machine damage. In this paper, a new method that predicts future faults and subsequently prevents losses caused by the faults has been developed. The method makes use of a series of digital transformations of signals from the manufacturing process. An important finding of this research is to divide the continuous signal stream into data segments from which a parameter called sum standard deviation frequency (SSDF) can be extracted. SSDF reflects the change of inconspicuous conditions in the signal in different data segments over time. To predict how the signal stream will perform in the next minute, a new density peak clustering computational algorithm is developed to transform the SSDF database into "normal", "marginal", and "abnormal" records. Finally, a novel method "moving SSDF deep learning" (MSDL) concept has been proven to have a better prediction of future capability than four other prediction methods. The method has been applied to a 3D printing process in which belt tension affecting machine performance has been predicted 30 s ahead of the problem, giving sufficient time for the operator to adjust or stop the machine before a fault occurs.

AB Dandelion Optimizer (DO) is a recently proposed swarm intelligence algorithm that coincides with the process of finding the best reproduction site for dandelion seeds. Compared with the classical Meta-heuristic algorithms, DO exhibits strong competitiveness, but it also has some drawbacks. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive hybrid dandelion optimizer called DETDO by combining three strategies of adaptive tent chaotic mapping, differential evolution (DE) strategy, and adaptive t-distribution perturbation to address the shortcomings of weak DO development, easy to fall into local optimum and slow convergence speed. Firstly, the adaptive tent chaos mapping is used in the initialization phase to obtain a uniformly distributed high-quality initial population, which helps the algorithm to enter the correct search region quickly. Secondly, the DE strategy is introduced to increase the diversity of dandelion populations to avoid algorithm stagnation, which improves the exploitation capability and the accuracy of the optimal solution. Finally, adaptive t-distribution perturbation around the elite solution successfully balances the exploration and exploitation phases while improving the convergence speed through a reasonable conversion from Cauchy to Gaussian distribution. The proposed DETDO is compared with classical or advanced optimization algorithms on CEC2017 and CEC2019 test sets, and the experimental results and statistical analysis demonstrate that the algorithm has better optimization accuracy and speed. In addition, DETDO has obtained the best results in solving six real-world engineering design problems. Finally, DETDO is applied to two bar topology optimization cases. Under a series of complex constraints, DETDO produces a lighter bar structure than the current scheme. It further illustrates the effectiveness and applicability of DETDO in practical problems. The above results mean that DETDO with strong competitiveness will become a preferred swarm intelligence algorithm to cope with optimization problems.

AB In the field of NC process design, a large number of designers or manufacturing enterprises have provided a wealth of crowd intelligence resources. However, the lack of organizational methods for the knowledge contained in a large number of machining process data makes it impossible to effectively utilize the machining process knowledge. At the same time, due to the intellectual property protection of machining process, process knowledge cannot be freely shared among designers and manufacturing enterprises, which makes the process design system limited in knowledge that can be applied and difficult to break through and improve. To counter this problem, a blockchain-based NC machining process decision and transaction approach is proposed. First, the process knowledge repositories in the process design consortium are structurally characterized by the probability graph structure to support the automatic decision-making of process schemes; Then, process design requirements are transmitted to each process design node in the consortium through the blockchain; Then, according to the process design requirements, the process scheme is determined in each node with the process design capability of such parts through depth first search and probability calculation; Finally, the process schemes are fed back to the demander through the blockchain to achieve the purpose of transaction and knowledge protection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the test of actual parts.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies has profoundly changed the way of human life and work, and in the healthcare field, the related product design is moving towards the trend of digitalization, intelligence, and personalization. The growing demands for personalised healthcare have contributed to a boom in product design theories in related fields. However, it is difficult to measure product users' preferences in precise numerical terms to make strategic decisions in product design. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework for virtual reality (VR) healthcare product design based on a data-driven concept and develops a VR virtual roaming system for system users guided by this theory. The data-driven concept incorporates AI and big data technologies into product design, helping to shift the design of medical products towards a data-centred approach. Ultimately, an ergonomic experiment was conducted and a case study was carried out to assess the user's experience using brain function data to enable data-driven VR value-added services. This study provides a new perspective on rehabilitation product design, opening the way for better personalised healthcare delivery.

AB Prefabrication is a sustainable construction method that improves productivity and reduces environmental footprints. Prefabricated panel is one typical type of components widely used in practice. When designing panel stacking plans for transportation, practitioners should consider numerous practical factors, e.g., panel stability and reshufflings. However, in current practice, stacking plans are made on the basis of planners' intuition and experience. A scientific method that can yield satisfactory panel stacking plans is thus required. Motivated by this real need, this paper aims to address a practical problem for practitioners: how to stack prefabricated panels transported by A-frame trailers with high stability and little reshuffling. This paper extends the literature by innovatively formulating a bi-objective mixed-integer programming model that incorporates all the aforementioned factors and objectives. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is designed to approximate the Pareto optimal solutions. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our proposed model and algorithm. The developed model and algorithm are capable of automatically performing calculations and effectively generating vertical stacking plans of high quality for planners in real-world settings within seconds. Future research may be devoted to the optimization of stacking plans for other types of prefabricated components or the horizontal stacking plans for components transported by flat-bed trailers.

AB With the growing density of air passenger traffic, accurately recognizing the level of mental fatigue (MF) experienced by air traffic controllers (ATCOs) is crucial for developing intelligent ATCOs' mental state moni-toring systems, which can achieve a more effective and safer human-machine cooperative pattern. However, the existing methods for recognizing ATCOs' MF face significant challenges due to pattern variations between ATCOs and sensor artifacts. This study introduces a framework for ATCOs' MF recognition, utilizing a deep neural network called RecMF, which incorporates multi-sensor information fusion to enhance the performance of MF detection. Specifically, the RecMF employs an attention-enabled CNN-LSTM architecture that simultaneously captures time-series feature representations of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and eye movements. To validate the effectiveness of RecMF, a fatigue-inducing experiment is conducted involving 28 subjects who are tasked with performing a series of air traffic control (ATC) tasks. The model's performance is evaluated across various time horizons and typical cognitive tasks to gain insights into its capabilities. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed model outperforms other existing methods, thereby confirming its feasibility and effectiveness. Additionally, the effects of MF on ATCOs' cognitive performance are analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results reveal that higher levels of MF significantly reduce ATCOs' reaction speed and operational accuracy.

AB The importance of pharmaceutical supply chains in ensuring the health of communities is obvious to everyone. In the event of a crisis, the importance of pharmaceutical supply chains becomes more visible, and paying attention to the dimensions of sustainability and resilience in supply chains is an active research issue. However, crisis logistics modeling with these factors for pharmaceutical products is rarely considered. In crises, perishable medicinal products such as drugs should be provided to hospitals at the lowest cost and expediently. This paper develops a new fuzzy robust stochastic model to deal with the crisis logistics of medicinal products by considering the dimensions of sustainability and resilience using multi-objective programming. Because this model contributes to the criteria of stability and flexibility. By defining three types of goals, this model seeks to find the optimal place to cover the demand when establishing field hospitals and the optimal route for transporting pharmaceutical products from the drug collection stands to the pharmacy, as well as the optimal route for transportation from the accident site to the field hospitals. Since the proposal is more complex than other pharmaceutical supply chain studies, to solve the model, a hybrid heuristic formulated by multi-choice objective programming is designed. The application of this model is indicated in a case study in Iran. The efficiency of the developed model is tested with sensitivities. The performance of the solution algorithm is analyzed with numerical results through quality and time measures. Finally, a discussion to evaluate the management insight of the solution of the proposed optimization model and the solution algorithm is concluded. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm reduces supply chain costs and dissatisfaction regarding the fairness of drug distribution and increases demand coverage.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the rapid advancement in the battery industry, more accurate and advanced state estimation methods are required to meet the performance requirements. The State of Health (SOH) estimation is performed in the battery management system (BMS), which provides the qualitative measure of the capability of a lithium-ion battery (LIB), in terms of capacity or internal resistance. Theoretically, the cell capacity is obtained by complete charge and discharge of the cell but in practical scenario, complete charge or discharge is never the case. To address this issue of dynamic discharge, this paper presents an evolving model-based SOH estimation, predicting the capacity fade of the cell extracted from the incomplete discharge conditions as in the case of dynamic driving scenarios. The evolving algorithm uses Neural Network, which features an interval fuzzy set, with conjectural jump positions. For better identification of overlaps between the classes, the quantum fuzzy set uses graded membership function. The number of rules are automatically adjusted and evolved, in the quantum fuzzy set using Decoupled Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) for parameter estimation. The proposed method uses voltage, current and sampling time data to estimate the capacity, over a period of 600 charging-discharging cycles of Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC) chemistry batteries. The dynamic discharge voltage data is obtained from the periodic characterization tests and is used for predict the complete discharge voltage. The full voltage profile has been forecasted using Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and the subsequent capacity has been estimated using evolving Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eQFNN) with an RMSE of less than 5% making it suitable for on-board applications. The results are simulated in MATLAB 2020b and are validated using experimental verification in Battery Testing Lab (BTL), IIT Delhi.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Inadequate environmental resources and overpopulation reveal the need to protect and recover natural resources attentively. In this sense, the reverse logistics concept emerged as a key solution since it deals with product flow from the final user to the origin. There are various items that need to be considered in well-planned reverse logistics network designs and one of these items is batteries which include hazardous and precious materials in it. Hence, waste management of batteries via recycling becomes a very significant issue from both economic and environmental benefits. Accordingly, depending on the importance of the topic, a two-stage methodology is proposed in this study for providing a network design under multiple objectives. Within the first stage, the importance weights of objectives are obtained via Spherical Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (SF-AHP) and they are found as 0.248 for cost minimization, 0.3 for carbon emission minimization, 0.256 for employment rate maximization and 0.196 for development rate maximization. Afterward, in the second stage, a Multi-Objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model (MO-MILP) is developed to design the reverse logistics network and an application is performed in Turkey for validation. The model is solved for various scenarios including different quantities to be collected. Hence, it is obtained that the satisfaction degrees for employment and development objectives are 100% in all of the scenarios. However, the satisfaction degree of carbon emission minimization is around 96% and the less satisfied objective is the cost minimization having a satisfaction degree of 75% on average.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Digital technology refers to any technology that uses digital signals or electronic data to process, store, and transmit information. Some examples of digital technologies include social media platforms, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain technology. Digital technology has the potential to play a significant role in achieving sustainable development goals by providing solutions for a wide range of environmental, social, and economic challenges. In this manuscript, we investigate digital technology implementation under sustainable development and would find which area of sustainable development is most in need of digital technology. Further, we investigate the operational laws based on Schweizer-Sklar t-norm and t-conorm and originate aggregation operators based on these deduced operational laws under the environment of bipolar complex fuzzy set that is bipolar complex fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar power averaging, bipolar complex fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar power weighted averaging, bipolar complex fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar power geometric and bipolar complex fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar power weighted geometric operators and then we deduce techniques of decision-making utilizing these originated operators. Afterward, we tackle a numerical example related to the digital technology implementation under sustainable development by considering artificial data and finding the area of sustainable development which is most in need of digital technology. Moreover, we reveal the impact of one of the digital technologies that are artificial intelligence in the field of healthcare and study a numerical example by considering hypothetical data by employing the originated technique of decision-making. At the last, we do a comparison of the deduced operators with numerous current operators to reveal the superiority and benefits of the deduced operators.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ROUGH SET
AB In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have focused on how to leverage limited information to make more reasonable decisions, thereby reducing the decision-making risk for decision-makers. Three-way decision, as a method for risky decision-making, offers a new approach to address this challenge and has gained significant attention. In view of this, based on the utility theory, this paper proposes a novel three-way utility decision model oriented to attribute fuzzy concept in multi-attribute environments. Firstly, an attribute fuzzy concept is constructed based on the decisionmaker's minimum requirements on each attribute. Subsequently, a new method for calculating the relative utility function is proposed, which is used to calculate the corresponding decision thresholds. Additionally, a generalized conditional probability calculation method is presented based on the attribute fuzzy concept and the basic semantics of conditional probability. Finally, a new three-way decision model is established to obtain the classification and ranking results of all objects. Through application analysis, comparative study and experimental analysis, the proposed method's rationality and effectiveness are verified.

AB Forest fires caused by natural causes such as climate change, temperature increase, lightning strikes, volcanic activity or human effects are among the world's most dangerous, deadly, and destructive disasters. Detection, prevention, and extinguishing forest fires is challenging. In addition, forest fires can cause habitat destruction that cannot be controlled in time and cause great material and moral losses. Therefore, fast and accurate Detection of forest fires is vital in emergency response. Here, in solving the problem, the transfer learning method from deep learning sub-topics can be used, which allows the application of pre-trained networks to a new problem. The Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine learning Evaluation dataset (consisting of forest fire images) obtained by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle was used in this study. In the Detection of forest fire images in the dataset, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, ResNet50V2, NASNetMobile, VGG-19 deep learning algorithms, transfer learning techniques that can produce more successful results than networks trained from scratch, and hybrid proposed with Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit algorithms methods have been applied. In the classification study with the Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine learning Evaluation dataset in performance measurement, 97.95% accuracy was obtained from the DenseNet121 model, which was started with random weights. In the transfer learning study using ImageNet weights, satisfactory results were obtained with 99.32% accuracy in the DenseNet121 model. We anticipate that working in forest fire detection and response can be entirely satisfactory.

AB Differential evolution (DE) is a simple and effective stochastic search algorithm, but its convergence speed and population diversity often decline catastrophically with the evolution process. In this paper, a differential evolution algorithm based on accompanying population and piecewise evolution strategy (APPDE) is proposed. The accompanying population is used to store suboptimal solutions, and its initialization, reinitialization and renewal mechanisms are designed to maintain the characteristics of suboptimal solutions and enhance the population diversity. The mutation operators are improved based on the accompanying population to balance the exploration and exploitation ability. In view of the phenomenon that the evolution speed slows down or even stagnates, the mutation strategies and control parameters are optimized by combining with piecewise evolution. The performance of APPDE is evaluated on CEC2014, CEC2015 and CEC2017 benchmark problem suites, and compared with the state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. The results show that APPDE has better performance than the competitive algorithms. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a severely under-determined and ill-posed inverse problem. Therefore, based on the compressed sensing theory and the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) model, a novel accelerated EIT sparse imaging algorithm is presented. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that the convex-concave procedure (CCP) method is used to optimize the non-convex cost function of the block sparse Bayesian learning model which improves the convergence speed and reduces the time complexity of the algorithm. The proposed method can adaptively explore and utilize the inter-block sparsity and intra-block structural correlation of non-sparse signals without any a priori information, thereby sparse imaging is performed on non-sparse physiological data effectively. The results comparing with other methods show that the proposed algorithm not only reconstruct inclusions with different shapes and conductivity applicably and effectively but also reduce the running time of the algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Feature selection (FS) is an important technique in data preprocessing that aims to reduce the number of features for training while maintaining a high accuracy for classification. In recent studies, FS has been extended to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously in classification. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes a new multiobjective optimization algorithm with dynamic operator selection for feature selection in high-dimensional classification, called FS-DOS. First, two complementary search operators with different characteristics are designed, where the first operator is a quick search (QS) operator aiming to accelerate the convergence speed, and the other operator is a modified binary differential evolution (BDE) operator that can prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. In addition, a dynamic selection strategy based on the idea of resource allocation is also designed to dynamically select the most suitable operator for each solution according to its corresponding performance improvement on aggregated objective values. The simulation results on fifteen different real-world high-dimensional FS datasets show that FS-DOS can obtain a feature subset with higher quality than several state-of-the-art FS algorithms. Importantly, in terms of error rate, FS DOS wins 55 out of 75 comparisons. In terms of dimensionality reduction, the number of features selected by FS-DOS is between one hundredth and one thousandth of the original dataset.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully employed to find the best structure for many learning algorithms including neural networks. Due to their flexibility and promising results, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found their application in many image processing applications. The structure of CNNs greatly affects the performance of these algorithms both in terms of accuracy and computational cost, thus, finding the best architecture for these networks is a crucial task before they are employed. In this paper, we develop a genetic programming approach for the optimization of CNN structure in diagnosing COVID-19 cases via X-ray images. A graph representation for CNN architecture is proposed and evolutionary operators including crossover and mutation are specifically designed for the proposed representation. The proposed architecture of CNNs is defined by two sets of parameters, one is the skeleton which determines the arrangement of the convolutional and pooling operators and their connections and one is the numerical parameters of the operators which determine the properties of these operators like filter size and kernel size. The proposed algorithm in this paper optimizes the skeleton and the numerical parameters of the CNN architectures in a co-evolutionary scheme. The proposed algorithm is used to identify covid-19 cases via X-ray images.

AB Electro-hydraulic shaking table (EHST) is widely used to simulate earthquake excitation in structural seismic tests. However, the nonlinear characteristics of the EHST, such as oil flow, friction, and dead zone, often lead to the distortion of seismic wave acceleration tracking and even cause the failure of the test. This paper describes the first application of Echo-State Networks (ESNs) to achieve high-precision seismic acceleration tracking of the EHST. The nonlinear control ability of the conventional three-variable control (TVC) algorithm in the EHST is discussed. An online learning compensation control framework using ESNs for "Transfer System"(The "Transfer System"denotes the nonlinear EHST controlled by TVC) is proposed. The least mean square (LMS) algorithm based on filtered-X is used to train the "ESN-Controller"online, and the initial transients of the "ESN-Controller"are reduced by using an estimation model of the actual "Transfer System"and a conditional switch. The offline iterative control (OIC) and nonlinear signal-based control (NSBC) are taken as the baseline algorithms of the proposed online learning compensation control. Simulation results show that the proposed online learning compensation control achieved excellent control with Pearson correlation coefficients of reference and responses above 99.6%, whereas the OIC and NSBC provided insufficient control. Moreover, the proposed online learning compensation control can also reduce the control error caused by the non-optimal TVC gains in the linear part of the EHST. This work throws new light on the study of the online learning control algorithm of the EHST.

AB Damage detection of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) composites is a challenging issue owing to their intrinsic high degree of anisotropy with complex failure modes. Data-driven approaches have great potential in damage detection for CFRP composites. However, the lack of physical interpretability makes data-driven methods highly dependent on the amount of data, which involves significant effort in experiment and is impractical to obtain for all damage conditions. To overcome the above challenges, a robust and generalizable framework for damage detection of CFRP composite structures is proposed by fusing monitoring data with physical mechanisms. In this framework, the numerical method is leveraged to build physical models of the composite structures to generate data under various damage conditions. Then, a deep transfer learning-based model is applied in the fusion of experiment and simulation data, which mitigates the discrepancy between the physical model and real experiment. With the combination of domain adaptation and domain adversarial training in the model, the domain invariant features can be generalized from the source domain (simulation data) to the target domain (experiment data). Therefore, the physical interpretability is supplemented in the data-driven model. To verify the adaptability of the method, different transfer tasks based on the accelerated aging experiments are performed. The results show that the proposed method can reduce the dependence of the data-driven methods on real monitoring data and prevails in all evaluation indicators than other methods. Eventually, this method can reduce the experiment effort of damage detection for composites while holding a great detection accuracy.

AB Knowledge Graphs is one of the most popular techniques for knowledge-based modelling in various subdomains of modern AI technologies ranging from natural language processing to e-commerce recommendations and cyberphysical systems. Even complex technical systems like telecommunication networks could be modelled by means of Knowledge Graphs. However, there are serious challenges when we deal with such systems having a huge number of interconnected elements (e.g. technical objects and their groups) that change over time. Thus, up-to-date there is no adequate solution for not only telecommunication networks but for any complex dynamic systems where inductive and deductive synthesis of large Knowledge Graph based models that are easily reconfigurable and scalable is required.We state and solve the problem of building such models for one of the most common types of objects where models can be represented as hierarchical re-configurable structures. This representation enables recent advances in multilevel inductive-deductive synthesis for model building.From a methodological viewpoint, we propose a novel complex approach to multilevel synthesis for objects with dynamic hierarchical structure based on modified methods for inductive and deductive synthesis of Knowledge Graphs. From a practical perspective we present a real case-study on an interactive service for digital cable TV networks - which is especially interesting for data engineers and scientists - where various problems ranging from network health monitoring to channel advertising can be solved with the same hierarchical model. We release an openly available domain benchmark, which features two realistic datasets (namely, for SPARQL querying performance analysis, and for our case study on dynamic network monitoring). Last but not least, our experiments with recent state-of-the-art approaches to knowledge graph querying Abdelaziz et al. (2017) show that the developed models of multilevel synthesis reduce the time complexity up to 73% on practice compared to the baselines, and are lossless and able to beat their competitors based on parallel knowledge graph processing from 4% to 91% in terms of computational time (depending on the query type). Further parallelisation of our multilevel models is even more efficient (the reduction of query processing time is about 40%-45%) and opens promising prospects for the creation and exploitation of dynamic Knowledge Graphs in practice.

AB The enormous growth in the volume of river transportation and the upgrade of inland waterways make inland shipping more and more important in transportation and logistics. This work proposes a hub-and-spoke network design (HSND) for container shipping in inland waterways based on the tree-like structure river. Firstly, the characteristics of the hub-and-spoke network in the inland waterways are presented in detail. Then, an integer linear programming model is proposed to simultaneously determine the optimal hub location, feeder port allocation, and fleet deployment to minimize the total cost of ships, transportation, and transshipment. A decomposition-based math-heuristic method and an enhanced genetic algorithm are then proposed to solve the HSND. A case study based on the traffic on the Yangtze River and extensive computational experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods. In addition, the impacts of the number of hub ports and the economies of scale resulting from the hub-and-spoke network are investigated from the economic and network structure perspectives, which leads to some managerial insights.

TI Improving distinctiveness in video captioning with text-video similarity

DT Article
DE Distinctiveness; Similarity scores; Video captioning; Video retrieval
AB Video captioning is a task of automatically describing visual content of a video with a sentence. Recent works in video captioning focus on improving the performance of sentence accuracy. However, the distinctiveness of sentence, i.e., highlighting unique and accurate details of video, in video captioning is still underexplored. This paper aims to improve sentence distinctiveness by incorporating video retrieval into the training process of the video captioning model. Specifically, the video retrieval will calculate similarity scores between the input text generated by the video captioning and videos. These similarity scores are then incorporated into the training loss of video captioning, which serves as distinctiveness constraint where the generated sentence and its corre-sponding video should have the highest similarity scores. To further improve the sentence distinctiveness, we additionally use reference scores, i.e., similarity scores between ground truth sentences and videos, as weights to scale the training loss of video captioning. This reference score serves as a target score for the model, indicating the desired level of distinctiveness for the generated sentence on how similar the generated sentence should be to the ground truth sentence for the corresponding video. Our qualitative and quantitative results show that our method improves sentence distinctiveness while simultaneously increasing its accuracy on MSVD and MSR-VTT datasets.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID INTEGRATION; SIMULATION; ROBOTS; MODEL
AB Robot motor skills can be acquired by deep reinforcement learning as neural networks to reflect state-action mapping. The selection of states has been demonstrated to be crucial for successful robot motor learning. However, because of the complexity of neural networks, human insights and engineering efforts are often required to select appropriate states through qualitative approaches, such as ablation studies, without a quantitative analysis of the state importance. Here we present a systematic saliency analysis that quantitatively evaluates the relative importance of different feedback states for motor skills learned through deep reinforcement learning. Our approach provides a guideline to identify the most essential feedback states for robot motor learning. By using only the important states including joint positions, gravity vector and base linear and angular velocities, we demonstrate that a simulated quadruped robot can learn various robust locomotion skills. We find that locomotion skills learned only with important states can achieve task performance comparable to the performance of those with more states. This work provides quantitative insights into the impacts of state observations on specific types of motor skills, enabling the learning of a wide range of motor skills with minimal sensing dependencies.
   Traditional feedback-state selection in robot learning is empirical and requires substantial engineering efforts. Yu et al. develop a quantitative and systematic state-importance analysis, revealing crucial feedback signals for learning locomotion skills.

AB Machining processes comprise numerous energy consumption activities. Given the significance of the circular economy and manufacturing sustainability to modern societies, it is paramount to design effective methodologies to accomplish energy-efficient machining processes. With this aim, this research presents a new approach of energy consumption optimisation for machining processes based on numerical control (NC) programs. In the approach, the following innovative characteristics are exhibited: (i) An energy model is systematically established based on a detailed analysis of energy consumption activities in machining processes; (ii) NC programs for specific machining processes are assessed in detail and popularised into the energy model for instantiation; (iii) An optimisation algorithm hybridising the genetic algorithm and the ant colony algorithm is designed to minimise air-cutting toolpaths to optimise the energy model. Two case studies were conducted to validate the presented approach. The case studies revealed that the accuracy of the energy model was 95.3% of the actual energy consumption. The studies also showed that, based on the optimised energy model, the total length of aircutting toolpaths was reduced by 43.8%, and the total machining time was diminished by 25.8%. It can be concluded that the developed approach can achieve substantial energy savings, and therefore it is highly promising to support machining industries to meet their sustainable targets.

AB Self-organizing systems have the potential to adapt to situation changes and gracefully deal with system degradations. Designing such systems, however, requires devising self-organizing knowledge into the individual agents of the system through either explicitly modelling the knowledge or allowing the agents to learn it by themselves through reinforcement learning. For tasks that are complex to a certain extent, the research has shown that developing proper reward functions with the help of reward shaping is an effective approach for successful multiagent reinforcement learning and hence for self-organizing systems design. In this case, agents often are individuals who learn by themselves through directly interacting with the task environment with little sense of the existence of other agents. As the task becomes more complex, explicitly considering the interactions among the agents during their learning process has evolved as a rich resource to explore for further eliciting the power of self-organizing systems. In this paper, social learning in its limited form-i.e., observing the actions of other agents-has been introduced to the multiagent reinforcement learning process, and a multiagent social deep Q-learning (MASo-DQL) has been developed and tested in the context of an assembly task complicated with obstacles. The experiment results have demonstrated that social learning can be effectively integrated into multiagent reinforcement learning frameworks through MASo-DQL; it has a positive impact on the training process and the task performance of the trained teams when the task complexity becomes high; and it entails costs and may lead to the inferior system performance for low complexity tasks.

   Regional multi-party subsidy mechanism
AB As an emerging internet service, online car-hailing allows users to do the car-hailing via their mobile phone instead of calling cars on the road. Though the convenient service provided by online car-hailing platforms, the following problems encountered in the process of real-time order-matching still cannot be well addressed: (1) the imbalance of the accessible cars in different areas, and (2) the conflict of interests among the drivers, platforms, and passengers. To address those problems, this paper proposes a set of order allocation strategy that fully consider the changing regional characteristics and the interests of multiple parties. Firstly, a dynamic region division method is proposed to identify the corresponding area types for real-time car-hailing. Then, a novel order allocation strategy with the regional multi-party subsidy mechanism is developed for different types of areas. Lastly, to help obtain a better performance for multiple parties, a parameter optimization method for the multi-party subsidy mechanism is introduced. The proposed order allocation strategy is evaluated on the real-world dataset sourced from an online car-hailing company. Our experiments verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, without reducing drivers' benefits, the order response time and order response rate are greatly improved, and the cost in all is acceptable for passengers and the platform. It is illustrated that a suitable regional multi-party subsidy mechanism could help online car-hailing platforms obtain higher passenger satisfaction than that without a regional multi-party subsidy mechanism.

AB Sparse rule base is one of the common problems in fuzzy rule-based systems, and fuzzy rule interpolation (FRI) could derive interpolated results for the input based on the neighbor fuzzy rules when the input is not matched by any of the fuzzy rules. The core idea of FRI is that similar inputs would lead to similar results, and several FRI methods that use a pre-defined number of closest rules to obtain the interpolated results have been presented. However, this could lead to the loss of some information as selecting a given number of rules without considering the exact distance between them and the input could lead to the selection of unwanted rules or the ignoring of similar rules. This paper presents a density-based fuzzy rule interpolation method that uses a density-based approach to search and select the closest rules for unmatched inputs. Instead of selecting a given number of rules, the proposed method adaptively selects the closest rules that are within a certain range of the unmatched inputs, thus assuring the selected rules are with high similarity to the inputs. The performance of the proposed method is verified through fifteen classification benchmarks, showing the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper focuses on the order acceptance and scheduling problem with worker-operation assignment considering the precedence constraint in the divisional seru production system, which is a new production type derived from Japan and can achieve responsiveness, flexibility, and efficiency simultaneously. With limited production capacity and workers with different skill sets and skill levels, the problem considered in this paper includes three sub-problems: (i) assigning workers to each seru, (ii) making the order acceptance and scheduling plan, and (iii) allocating workers to operations for each order. Subsequently, a nonlinear integer programming model is established for improving the total net revenue, and a bi-level nested heuristic algorithm is designed due to its intractable computation. Computational experiments are made finally, and results show that the objective value obtained by the bi-level nested heuristic algorithm is 3% better than the bi-level genetic algorithm, and the running time is shortened by 99.23%. That is, the proposed bi-level nested heuristic algorithm can achieve better results and higher efficiency for divisional seru order acceptance and scheduling problems.

AB This document presents a method to construct continuous fuzzy controllers that yield finite-time stability of the closed-loop system. The proposed approach allows the user to follow classical design procedures for fuzzy systems without using other finite-time techniques such as sliding modes. The finite-time stability property is a consequence of a special kind of input membership function of the fuzzy inference system. The continuity properties of the fuzzy inference system are studied. Sufficient conditions for the output of the fuzzy inference system to be Lipschitz continuous are stated. A comparison with the asymptotic counterpart of the controller is also presented. The results support the hypothesis that finite-time controllers provide improved robustness to the steady state response.

AB Accurate wind speed forecasting is crucial for the stability improvement of wind power grid connection and the rational dispatch of wind energy resources. Most previous studies have focused on the improvement of deter-ministic forecasting, often ignoring the importance of probabilistic forecasting. A single deterministic forecasting method is difficult to reflect the uncertainty of wind speed, which is an incomplete assessment of wind power grid connection risk. Therefore, this paper proposes a wind speed forecasting system consisting of secondary decomposition (SD), double fuzzy information granulation (DFIGR), CNNGRU hybrid forecasting method and slime mould algorithm (SMA), which can perform both deterministic and probabilistic wind speed forecasting, further complementing the existing research in this field. The forecasting system firstly decomposes the wind speed series into multiple sub-series by the method of SD. The interval range and mean values of the granulated data are then obtained by DFIGR, and the optimal system input is determined by parameter search for the window size and affiliation bound of DFIGR using SMA. Finally, the series after phase space reorganization are subjected to deterministic and probabilistic forecasting by the CNNGRU forecasting model, respectively. Multiple experiments and evaluations over four seasons demonstrate that the proposed forecasting system can not only grasp the trend of wind speed, but also measure the uncertainty range of wind speed, which has significant advantages over the comparison models. In deterministic point forecasting, the proposed model achieved an average improvement of 63.6%, 34.5%, and 58.1% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to the model without decomposition, the model without CNNGRU, and multiple benchmark models, respectively. In proba-bilistic interval forecasting, the proposed model achieved an average improvement of 28.7%, 34.2%, and 16.8% in Average Interval Score (AIS) compared to the model without decomposition, the model without DFIGR, and the model without CNNGRU, respectively.

AB This article studies the problem of saturation-tolerant prescribed control (SPC) for a class of nonlinear time-delay systems with unknown control directions. We propose a unified finite-time tunnel prescribed performance (FTPP), which not only provides more tight allowable set leading to smaller overshoot, but also drives the tracking error into the prescribed set within a known time. To remove the implicit assumption that both input and performance constraints need to be satisfied simultaneously, an auxiliary system is developed to establish a balance between these two constraints instead of ignoring their interconnection and conflict. With aid of its generated nonnegative signals, the developed saturation-tolerant prescribed performance (SPP) possesses flexible performance. Namely, SPP can temporarily enlarge the performance boundaries to guarantee both constraints when input saturation occurs, and fast recover back to the prescribed boundaries when input saturation disappears. Consequently, a low-complexity SPC for uncertain nonlinear systems is developed, which can always guarantee both input and performance constraints even under unknown time delay and unknown control directions. Finally, comparative simulation is provided to illustrate the merits of the presented control strategy.

AB In this article, a novel optimized fuzzy adaptive control method based on tracking error derivatives of subsystems is proposed for strict-feedback systems with unmeasurable states. A cost function based on the tracking error derivative is used. It not only solves the problem that the traditional input quadratic cost function at the infinite time is unbounded, but also solves the problem that the optimal control input derived from the cost function with exponential discount factor cannot make the error asymptotically stable. Considering the case where the states are unmeasurable, a fuzzy state observer is designed that removes the restriction of the Hurwitz equation for the gain parameters. Based on reinforcement learning, the observer, and error derivative cost function, an improved optimized backstepping control method is given. Using observed information and actor-critic structure to train fuzzy logic systems online, the control inputs are obtained to achieve approximate optimal control. Finally, all closed-loop signals are proved to be bounded by the Lyapunov method, and the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm are verified through two examples.

AB The adaptive fuzzy predefined-time tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear systems with output hysteresis is investigated in this article. An inverse model is utilized to capture the output hysteresis phenomenon, and then, the Nussbaum-type function technique is utilized to overcome the difficulty of unknown time-varying control gain caused by output hysteresis. An adaptive fuzzy control scheme under the backstepping framework is developed using the predefined-time stability criterion. Different from the existing predefined-time design approaches, the adaptive law designed in this article is represented as a nonlinear differential equation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that all signals of the closed-loop systems are bounded, and the tracking error can converge to the neighborhood near the origin within an expected settling time. The developed scheme's feasibility is verified by an example of an electromechanical system.

AB Deep learning methods have achieved an excellent performance in medical image segmentation. However, the practical application of deep learning-based segmentation models is limited in clinical settings due to the lack of reliable information about the segmentation quality. In this article, we propose a novel quality control algorithm based on fuzzy uncertainty to quantify the quality of the predicted segmentation results as part of the model inference process. First, test-time augmentation and Monte Carlo dropout are applied simultaneously to capture both the data and model uncertainties of the trained image segmentation model. Then, a fuzzy set is generated to describe the captured uncertainty with the assistance of the linear Euclidean distance transform algorithm. Finally, the fuzziness of the generated fuzzy set is adopted to calculate an image-level segmentation uncertainty and, therefore, to infer the segmentation quality. Extensive experiments using five medical image segmentation applications on the detection of skin lesion, nuclei, lung, breast, and cell are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm. The experimental results show that the estimated image-level uncertainties using the proposed method have strong correlations with the segmentation qualities measured by the Dice coefficient, resulting in absolute Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.60-0.92. Our method outperforms other five state-of-the-art quality control methods in classifying the segmentation results into good and poor quality groups (area under the receiver operating curve of greater than 0.92, while other methods are below 0.85).

AB In this article, we consider multiparty synchronization (MS) for coupled memristive neural networks (CMNNs) with a time delay. Some Takagi-Sugeno type if-then fuzzy rules are also introduced into the CMNNs. An event-triggered controller (ETC) is designed to achieve the MS in finite time, which avoids continuous control signals. Along with Lyapunov theory, differential inclusion theory, and inequalities, some criteria can be obtained to achieve the finite-time MS (FTMS), and the setting time (ST) of the FTMS can be calculated. By jointly considering ST, control inputs, error networks, and synchronization conditions, an optimization model is provided to get an optimal ETC (OETC). Further, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is utilized to solve the optimization model. Thus, it gives a method to choose control gains and parameters of an event-triggered function. Finally, two examples are given to verify the theoretical results. Especially, two comparative experiments are proposed to demonstrate that the OETC can save more control energy and reduce the number of triggered times.

AB In this article, an adaptive fuzzy tracking control scheme based on a fuzzy state observer is proposed for a class of uncertain, nonstrict feedback, nonlinear systems with function constraints. In the first place, based on the approximation characteristic of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), a fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the immeasurable state variables in the controlled system. Next, under the framework of adaptive backstepping control technology, FLSs are selected not only to approximate unknown nonlinear functions but also to avoid the algebraic loop problem caused by nonstrict feedback structure. At the same time, asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov functions are selected to solve the problem that system states are subject to function constraints, which are related to states and time. Then, Lyapunov stability theory is utilized to prove the stability of the controlled system, the realizability of function constraints, and the convergence of output tracking errors. Finally, a simulation is given to check the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.

AB This article addresses the adaptive secure control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPSs) subjected to deception attacks. Specifically, a novel adaptive fuzzy control scheme for each subsystem of CPSs is designed to mitigate the effects of cyberattacks that intentionally tamper with control signals from controllers to actuators and the state signals from sensors to controllers, and a Nussbaum function is proposed to tackle unknown time-varying control directions. Moreover, a finite-time converging secure control scheme is designed for compromised CPSs to guarantee all the states converge to a predetermined small set in finite time. It is shown that with the proposed control scheme, all the signals of the closed-loop system are proved to be semiglobally bounded. Two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure control method.

AB It is challenging to deal with the relationship between the triggering interval and the dwell time when mode-pendent event-triggered control is considered for switched systems, especially complete actuator faults occur in some subsystems (or modes). Therefore, this article considers the exponential stabilization almost surely (ES a.s.) for a class of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with delay and stochastic switching by designing a novel mode-dependent event-triggered output control. It is assumed that only the measured output can be utilized in designing the controller and complete actuator faults occur in some modes. Periodic sampling is utilized to avoid the Zeno phenomenon. Combining the sampling interval with delay-partitioning method, a fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is designed on the basis of the derivative of the membership functions to obtain less conservative results. Especially, the increment coefficient of the multiple LKF at switching instant is smaller than one. The maximum feasible value of the sampling interval is derived and the control gains are designed by solving linear matrix inequalities. Our results show that the ES a.s. is ensured though some modes are not controlled. Numerical simulations demonstrate the merits of the theoretical analysis. It is significant to find by numerical simulations that the time delay cannot be divided into too small values though the delay-partitioning method is effective in reducing the conservativeness.

During the controller design process, the difficultly of system controller design caused by nontriangular structural uncertainties that mixed unmodeled dynamics are handled by utilizing the variable separation technique and fuzzy logic system. Then, based on the adaptive compensation technique, a fault-tolerant controller is designed to solve the influence of actuator faults for system stability. Finally, the stability of the stochastic nonlinear interconnected system can be ensured by stochastic Lyapunov stability theory. In addition, numerical and practical simulations also illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB This article presents a fuzzy optimization design for the tank bidirectional stabilization system with a fully electric actuator. The uncertainty in the system is (possibly fast) time-varying but lies in the fuzzy set. First, a machine-electric coupled state-space equation that can accurately describe the state transition of the system is established by considering the assembly relationship among components. Second, inequality constraints are proposed to reduce the range of steady-state error fluctuations. By constraint reorganization, a new system containing only equality constraints is constructed to replace the original system. The control problem for systems with inequality constraints is solved. Third, fuzzy set theory is used to characterize the "fuzzy" features of the uncertainty in the system more accurately, and robust control with parameters to be determined is proposed. The optimal control parameter is selected by establishing and minimizing a fuzzy performance index, which weighs the effectiveness and cost of control. Thus, the contradiction between short time and high precision control performance due to the fast movement of the tank is solved. This article is the first to consider the tank bidirectional stabilization system with a fully electric actuator as a fuzzy mechanical system with inequality constraints and conduct an optimization design after proposing an error-controllable control strategy.

ID FULLY HOMOMORPHIC ENCRYPTION; BELIEF NETWORKS
AB In this article, we consider the problem of privacy-preserving distributed deep learning where data privacy is protected by fully homomorphic encryption. The aim is to develop a method for practical and scalable distributed deep learning with fully homomorphic encrypted data. The method must address the issue arising from the large computational cost associated with fully homomorphic encrypted data to offer a practical and scalable solution. An approach that leverages fuzzy-based membership mappings for data representation learning is considered for distributed deep learning with fully homomorphic encrypted data. The method introduces globally convergent and robust variational membership mappings to build local deep models. The local models are combined in a robust and flexible manner by means of fuzzy attributes to build a global model such that the global model can be homomorphically evaluated in an efficient manner. The membership-mappings-based privacy-preserving distributed deep learning method is accurate, practical, and scalable. This is verified through numerous experiments that include demonstrations using MNIST and Freiburg Groceries datasets, and a biomedical application related to the detection of mental stress on individuals. This study develops globally convergent and robust variational membership mappings for their application to accurate, practical, and scalable privacy-preserving distributed deep learning.

ID SUPPLIER SELECTION METHOD
AB Based on the closed operational laws in picture fuzzy numbers and strict triangular norms, we extend the Bonferroni mean (BM) operator under the picture fuzzy environment to propose the picture fuzzy interactional Bonferroni mean (PFIBM), picture fuzzy interactional weighted Bonferroni mean (PFIWBM), and picture fuzzy interactional normalized weighted Bonferroni mean (PFINWBM) operators. We prove the monotonicity, idempotency, boundedness, and commutativity for the PFIBM and PFINWBM operators. We also establish a novel multicriteria decision making (MCDM) method under the picture fuzzy environment by applying the PFINWBM operator. Furthermore, we apply our MCDM method to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems selection. The comparative results for our MCDM method induced by six classes of well-known triangular norms ensure that the best selection is always the same ERP system. Therefore, our MCDM method is effective for dealing with the picture fuzzy MCDM problems.

TI An Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means Noise Image Segmentation Algorithm Combining

ID MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; RANDOM-FIELD MODELS; FCM
AB Noisy image segmentation using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is an important direction in the field of image segmentation, among which FCM using local information or nonlocal information constraints has made some progress. However, as the noise density increases, the local information cannot restore the real image. The nonlocal information-based segmentation method overly retains the noise and thus produces false edges resulting in the degradation of image segmentation accuracy (SA). To address these problems, this article uses regional and local information to develop an adaptive FCM image segmentation algorithm. First, the regional information and local information are obtained by the regional information filtering method and the local information filtering method. Then, the weighted image is constructed in a certain way. Second, to make the objective function adaptively adjust the constraint ratio of the original image and the weighted image pixel by pixel, the degree of constraint is adaptively changed by using the difference between them as the coefficients of both through certain transformation. Finally, to speed up the convergence of the objective function, we add the number of clustering samples to the denominator of the objective function by certain transformations to reduce the number of iterations of the objective function. The proposed algorithm achieves more than 90% in image SA and mean Intersection-over-Union through synthetic and real-world image tests and acquires good performance in other indexes.

AB In this article, the problems of state-triggered sampling and self-triggered tracking control for nonlinear systems with constraints are studied. First, the fuzzy observer is designed for the unknown state. In the presence of state-triggered sampling error, the cooperative design of constraint controller is a key problem to be solved. The median value theorem provides help to solve this problem and an asymmetric state-triggering strategy is presented. In addition, it is proved that the closed-loop signals are input-to-state stable, and the sampling error and tracking error are bounded. Then, a general self-triggered tracking control scheme is presented. In order to compare the control performance of different triggering mechanisms, fuzzy observer and logarithmic barrier Lyapunov function are selected also, and the scheme is designed under the framework of backstepping method. Co-designing controllers and scheduling functions is a key issue, so that the physical implementation benefits from not requiring constant monitoring of the state. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by case study, and the control performance of different triggering mechanisms is compared.

AB For nonlinear delayed parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems, this article addresses fault-tolerant stochastic sampled-data (SD) fuzzy control under spatially point measurements (SPMs). Initially, a T-S fuzzy PDE model is given to accurately describe the nonlinear delayed parabolic PDE system. Second, in consideration of possible actuator failure, a fault-tolerant SD fuzzy controller with stochastic sampling under SPMs is designed for nonlinear delayed parabolic PDE system, where two sampling periods are considered whose occurrence probabilities are given constants and satisfy the Bernoulli distribution. Then, by constructing a novel time-dependent Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions that guarantee the mean square exponential stability of closed-loop delayed PDE system are obtained based on linear matrix inequalities. Last, three examples are given to illustrate the designed approach.

AB In this article, a specified-time event-triggered fuzzy adaptive control algorithm is developed to solve the consensus tracking control problem for stochastic high-order nonlinear multiagent networks, which is intrinsically challenging due to the existence of stochasticity and high-order (positive odd integers greater than one) terms. More precisely, a novel specified-time performance function is incorporated into the time-varying high-order tan-type barrier Lyapunov function to guarantee that the tracking errors remain under time-varying constraints within specified time. Combining fuzzy logic systems with the adding on power integrator technique, an adaptive approximation policy is introduced to handle the system uncertainties. Moreover, a new switching threshold event-triggered mechanism is devised to determine the control signals updating instants, which reduces the transmission and computation burden, while resizing the triggering threshold in real time. The Zeno phenomenon is excluded by guaranteeing that the triggering intervals is lower bounded by a positive constant. Two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed algorithm.

AB Restricted equivalence functions are well-known functions to compare two numbers in the interval between 0 and 1. Despite the numerous works studying the properties of restricted equivalence functions and their multiple applications as support for different similarity measures, an extension of these functions to an n-dimensional space is absent from the literature. In this article, we present a novel contribution to the restricted equivalence function theory, allowing to compare multivalued elements. Specifically, we extend the notion of restricted equivalence functions from L to Ln and present a new similarity construction on Ln. proposal is tested in the context of color image anisotropic diffusion as an example of one of its many applications.

AB To manage consensus in opinion dynamics models (ODMs), removing bias from agents' interactions and considering their willingness are critical. It can be accomplished by providing a secure mechanism that does not disclose agents' identities and opinions in their interactions, eliminating the impact of opinion similarity on trust building. To build trust and consensus opinion, we propose a linguistic ODM based on the Blockchain technology. This model allows agents' opinions to be expressed using Z-numbers, as opposed to regular ODMs with numerical opinions. Agents are encouraged to modify their initial opinions in response to a minimum cost consensus model. Willingness of agents to accept or refuse the suggested modifications is realized through a Blockchain regime to avoid bias. The regime, however, must be supported by a trust-building mechanism to persuade agents to alter their opinions. To this end, we propose a Blockchain-enabled trust-building mechanism to improve agents' trust and guide them toward a consensus opinion. Following a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions in the developed model, the proposed ODM is tested for its efficiency and validity.

TI Observer-Based Fuzzy Adaptive Tracking Control of Nonlinear

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
AB It is known that a controller designed via backstepping contains all virtual control signals constructed at the previous design steps. When this controller is used to generate an event-triggered control signal which is discontinuous, those virtual control signals are simultaneously triggered and the corresponding triggered virtual signals are utilized for the real control operation, they are also discontinuous. This fact results in the noncontinuity of the virtual error dynamics. This problem is ignored in the existing backstepping-based event-triggered control schemes, in which control design and stability analysis are implemented according to the continuous virtual error dynamics, namely, all the virtual control signals are required to be continuous. Based on this observation, this article focuses on the backstepping-based event-triggered fuzzy adaptive control for nonlinear strict-feedback systems with unavailable states. To do so, a concurrent event generator is first introduced, furthermore, the backstepping-based output feedback control design is given according to the discontinuous virtual error dynamics. Then, the Lyapunov approach for nonlinear impulsive systems is used to provide the closed-loop performance analysis. The results show that with the event-based fuzzy adaptive controller, all the closed-loop signals meet bounded requirements and the Zeno phenomenon is prevented. Ultimately, the proposed theoretical results are supported by two simulation examples.

ID STABILITY ANALYSIS; TRENDS
AB This article addresses the problem of dynamic event-triggered (DET) control for networked interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy systems subject to multiple cyber-attacks, which contain deception attacks and aperiodic denial-of-service attacks simultaneously. First, a multiple cyber-attack model is established for the IT2 fuzzy systems with multiple cyber-attacks and external disturbances. Second, an improved DET mechanism (DETM) is proposed to reduce the communication burden. Contrasting with existing works, by introducing two adjustable parameters into the novel DETM, the presented DETM has more flexibility in adjusting the data packet transmissions to conserve more limited network resources. Meanwhile, the Zeno behavior is probably excluded under the proposed DETM while preserving the system performance. Third, imperfectly matched membership functions (MFs) are considered between fuzzy controller and IT2 fuzzy model, and the global boundary information of MFs and slack matrices are introduced to relax stability conditions. Besides, by constructing a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the exponentially mean-square stable of the IT2 fuzzy systems with the H-8 performance. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB This article considers the situation of sensors transmit plant states to controller in a dynamic event-triggered manner and develops a fuzzy-model-based adaptive command filtered tracking control method for nonlinear strict-feedback systems with uncertain dynamics. First, the dynamic event-trigger rules are designed and implemented in sensor-to-controller channel to reduce the communication frequency in network controlled system. Then, the adaptive fuzzy-model is designed to generate approximated states for controller during the event-trigger intervals to avoid an open-loop like system operation, which can be caused by the traditional zero-order-hold policy. Moreover, command filter technique is incorporated to solve the issue of "jumping of virtual controller" and circumvent "explosion of complexity" problem during the fuzzy-model-based event-triggered controller design process. Meanwhile, the filtering errors are eliminated by compensate signals. Finally, two simulation examples are conducted and the results show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

ID OPTIMAL SCALE SELECTION; PROSPECT THEORY; MODEL
AB The three-way decision theory provides a three-way philosophical thinking to solve problems, and the regret theory quantifies the risk preferences of decision makers under different psychological behaviors. On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.

AB This article is focused on the adaptive event-based interval type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy security control problem for networked control systems with multiple network attacks. In order to save the network resources, this article proposes an improved adaptive event-triggered model, which can adjust the threshold dynamically according to the change of current signal and previous triggering signal. In addition, due to the change of external environment, the impact of randomly occurring output bias is considered in the systems. Taking the effects of multiple network attacks and adaptive event-triggered scheme into consideration, a class of augmented error fuzzy system model is established. Next, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the stochastic stability with an H8 performance index via the Lyapunov stability analysis method. The corresponding parameters of the IT-2 fuzzy controllers and observers are also derived by some linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are given to support the advantages of the proposed method. communication to fuzzy the series extended T-S solve

AB In this article, we introduce fuzzy minimax nets as a novel tool to compute the greatest fuzzy bisimulation/simulation between two finite fuzzy labeled graphs. Fuzzy labeled graphs are a universal data structure for representing fuzzy systems, such as fuzzy automata, fuzzy labeled transition systems, fuzzy Kripke models, fuzzy social networks, and fuzzy interpretations in description logic. The greatest fuzzy bisimulation between two such systems characterizes the similarity between their states, actors, or individuals. Using fuzzy minimax nets, we design the first algorithms for the mentioned computational problems in the case of using the product t-norm, as well as the first algorithms whose complexity order does not depend on the fuzzy values occurring in the inputs for those problems in the case of using the Lukasiewicz t-norm.

AB This article is concerned with global exponential synchronization of delayed fuzzy neural networks with reaction diffusions (RDFNNs). By adopting analytic method and some inequality techniques, a global exponential synchronization criterion in terms of p-norm (p = 2) is obtained for the RDFNNs via adaptive intermittent control. One numerical example is provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed outcomes. Two other examples are given to show the applications in image encryption and pseudorandom number generation, respectively.

TI A Probabilistic Linguistic Three-Way Decision Method With Regret Theory

AB Aiming at multiattribute decision-making (MADM) problems with probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs), and considering the effective rationality of a decision-maker (DM) in complex decision environments, this article proposes a probabilistic linguistic three-way decision (TWD) method based on the regret theory (RT), namely, PL-TWDR. First, a probabilistic linguistic attribute weight determination method is developed that considers probabilistic linguistic information entropies and the weighted total deviation of all objects from the negative ideal solution (NIS). Then, a new group satisfaction index is designed to replace the utility function in RT, which overcomes the limitation of the RT calculation in PLTSs. Second, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is extended to PLTSs for obtaining equivalent objects under different clusters and calculate conditional probabilities in corresponding TWD models, which makes up for the shortage of the PLTS evaluation matrix when dividing equivalence classes. Third, RT is introduced into PLTSs to rank objects according to utility perception values. At the same time, a new TWD model constructed by average utility perception values is used to realize object domains in probabilistic linguistic environments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to realistic cases, and the effectiveness and superiority of the PL-TWDR method are verified via comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis in terms of other nine popular decision-making methods.

In order to estimate the unmeasurable system states and handle the nonsynchronization issue of premise variables between the observer/controller and the original system, a new nonsynchronous piecewise fuzzy affine observer is first synthesized to estimate the unmeasurable system state variables. Via utilizing some elegant matrix inequalities with convexification techniques, new observer-based piecewise output-feedback controller design results are proposed within the framework of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Simulation studies are given to illustrate the validity of the developed approach.

AB This work investigates the adaptive fixed-time disturbance rejection control issue for a class of time-delay nonlinear systems subject to event-triggered and quantized input signals. First, a disturbance observer is proposed to promote the controller design. Compared with the related disturbance observer design, the observer designed in this article can be used to construct the fixed-time control scheme. Then, combined with the backstepping technique and fuzzy logic systems, an adaptive fuzzy event-triggered and quantized fixed-time control scheme is designed. Moreover, to deal with the unknown time delays, the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method is utilized to achieve the system stability. The proposed control algorithm reduces the transmission burden of the data channel with a new combined event-based sampling and quantization and improves the robustness of the time-delay nonlinear system. Finally, a numerical example and a practical example are given to validate the feasibility of the control scheme.

AB The impulsive consensus problems of nonlinear time-delay multiagent system under communication constraints are analyzed and investigated in this article. In view of the limited communication channel, global input saturation constraint is integrated into the design of impulse control protocol. Furthermore, in order to reduce energy consumption and communication cost, two kinds of impulsive control protocols are designed that conclude general impulsive control protocols and event-triggered impulsive control protocols. For event-triggered impulsive control protocols, by setting event decision time at impulse time, this novel consensus control protocols not only decrease communication frequency and energy consumption but also avoid "Zeno behavior." Through theoretical derivation, some sufficient conditions that guarantee the leader-following consensus of multiagent system are presented. In the end, for the sake of explaining the superiority of impulse control combined with event-triggered control strategy in more detail, the simulations of two control methods are given, respectively, for the same multiagent system, which can be better compared and explained.

AB In multilabel learning, research on label correlation provides an effective solution to compress the hypothesis space of classifiers. However, this article focus on the label correlation adapted to overall data, while ignoring the locally targeted information presented by some instances. The lack exploration on the distribution of local label correlation in multilabel instance space undoubtedly limits the in-depth application of label correlation in multilabel learning. Based on the fuzzy rough set theory, the instance-level label correlation distribution is first proposed in this article and applied to design a novel multilabel learner. For each multilabel instance, the local importance of features to label is quantitatively analyzed, by considering the decisive influence of input information on decision making. According to coincidence degree between local feature weight distribution for different labels, the instance-level label correlation is constructed. In order to reflect the internal relationship between label variables objectively, the instance-level label correlation distribution is integrated into the empirical label relevance. On the basis, the label relevance matrix is used to define the constraints of the optimization function in a new form. The relative position of subseparating hyperplanes in input space is quantitatively characterized to reduce the complexity of the multilabel classifier and improve the learning performance. The experiment results on 18 multilabel datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. The impact of core parameters on the performance is also dissected.

AB One of the currently visible requirements of data analysis concerns data privacy. The quest for privacy triggers design challenges in the construction of machine learning models. In this study, we propose a novel and systematic design methodology of fuzzy design rule-based models completed in the following privacy-driven environment. Multidimensional data are available for model design in two different formats: those attributes that are privacy sensitive are provided at the higher nonnumeric level of abstraction represented in the form of information granules, while the remaining ones are available directly. It is shown that the granular manifestation of data becomes beneficial in the formation of the conditions of the rules, whereas numeric attributes are available for the construction of the conclusions of the rules. The generic development scheme is discussed. Some generalization is introduced to cope with a number of data islands associated with the corresponding data owners. It is shown that the formation of the data structure calls for a mechanism of collaborative clustering. A way of handling information granules at different levels of information granularity is discussed. Some illustrative examples are presented.

This rule system was conjectured to be complete, it is however incomplete and an additional five rules were formulated. The generalization of one of those rules subsequently showed that no finite rule system exists and in recent work even all five additional rules were (further) generalized. In this paper, two new generalized rules are stated, both involving n, n & GE; 1 variable sets Ci. These rules generalize the semi-graphoid rule for n is odd and general-ize one of the additional rules for n is even. Furthermore two new rules of probabilistic independence are given. The paper thereby contributes to the insights into the structural properties of probabilistic independence and provides an enhanced description of proba-bilistic independence by means of rules. & COPY; 2023 The Author.

AB The intention of this work is to create an advanced VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) approach that deals with multiple criteria optimization and compromise solutions in the face of circular intuitionistic fuzzy (C-IF) uncertainty. There has been limited research on enhancing VIKOR techniques to manipulate multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) with sophisticated C-IF information. Specifically, the relative score function in current C-IF VIKOR methods loses its meaning when the radius of the C-IF number is zero, restricting its applicability to regular intuitionistic fuzzy contexts. Furthermore, converting C-IF information into intuitionistic fuzzy contents prematurely using existing C-IF VIKOR algorithms results in inadequate preservation of the C-IF connotation, hindering the primary objective of using C-IF theory to manage MCDA issues. This study addresses the limitations of the current relative score system in C-IF contexts and recommends a more legitimate and fair scoring function. The upgraded C-IF scoring function includes scaling and exponential parameters, making it more pragmatic and adaptable than the present relative scoring mechanism. By connecting the suggested C-IF scoring function with the recently published C-IF Minkowski distance measurements, the study establishes a parameterized C-IF VIKOR methodology to analyze MCDA issues arising from C-IF uncertainty. The suggested parameterized C-IF VIKOR model provides accessible assessments of individual regret, collective utility, and trade-off indices by utilizing three- and four-term C-IF metric ratios. The model constructs a synthesized mechanism to investigate the requirements for acceptable advantage and decision-making stability for locating agreeable compromise solutions. The viability and performance of the suggested technique are manifested through applications in waste disposal location selection, multi-expert supplier evaluation, and medical waste disposal techniques. Comparative analysis is executed to highlight implications for theory, practice, and future research. This study provides significant contributions, including (i) an innovative approach to the C-IF VIKOR methodology for broadening the coverage of higher-order fuzzy research models, (ii) a new CIF scoring function for decision aiding to overcome the limitation of the current relative score function, and (iii) a novel conceptual framework of a parameterized VIKOR for empowering decision-makers with more leeway in adapting the VIKOR solution to intuitively judged outcomes.

AB This article aims to develop the Aczel-Alsina operational laws based on power aggregation operators (PAOs) for the q-Rung orthopair fuzzy set (FS) (q-ROFS) framework. Changing the parameter can alter these sets according to the degree of fluctuation, providing a range of options. The decision-making sciences use "qROFS"to describe the family of the most distinct fuzzy information thoughts. In response to the degree of variation, the q-ROFSs can increasingly adjust the information region by fluctuating the restriction ������ & GE; 1, making numerous options. But on the other hand, PAOs have the advantage of vanishing the influence of awkward data from the final results. To take advantages of POAs, based on Aczel-Alsina (AA) operational laws, q-Rung orthopair fuzzy (q-ROF) AA power-weighted averaging (q-ROFAAPWA) and q-ROF AA power-weighted geometric (q-ROFAAPWG) operators are stated. Also, it studied that the proposed AOs fulfilled the conditions of boundedness, monotonicity, and idempotency. Based on these newly constructed AOs, a technique for dealing the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problems is suggested. Numerous research, correlations with another modern approach and a numerical example of selecting stock market companies have been used to show the suggested system's applicability. The sensitivity analysis of the developed method is examined. A comparative study with other prevailing methods is also providing for superiority analysis. Finally, we demonstrated that in the results and discussion section, the proposed AOs in the q-ROPFS framework are more reliable in aggregating information than intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) set (IFS) and Pythagorean FS (PyFS) frameworks.

AB Although research on time series prediction based on deep learning is being actively carried out in various industries, deep learning technology still has a high entry barrier for researchers who have not majored in computer science. This paper presents a tutorial on time series prediction using a deep learning-based model. The entire process of time series data prediction is presented-from data collection to evaluation of prediction results. The details of each step are shown through a case example of predicting peak electricity demand and system marginal price of Jeju Island in Korea using the 1D-CNN and BiLSTM model. In Jeju Island, the proportion of renewable energy in the total power generation capacity is increased to 67% in 2021, requiring more accurate electricity demand forecasts. Therefore, using 808 days of training data from February 2018, electricity demand and SMP for the next 21 days were predicted. To make it easier for readers to follow, the example uses only open public data, and the entire Python source code is shared via a GitHub repository. The prediction error calculated by WRMSSE showed 0.42 in electricity demand and 0.63 in SMP max. A WRMSSE value less than one means that the forecast was relatively good, that is, better than naive forecasting. This tutorial is not limited to the energy industry but can be utilized for any application requiring time-series data prediction. This article is expected to be of great help to researchers who need to understand the process of time series prediction using deep learning and use it for application in their industry.

AB Estimation of reservoir parameters such as porosity, lithology and determination of elastic moduli is based on well-logging data and seismic velocity information. However, the lack of shear velocity log in many wells, and the high costs of its acquisition have led to developing different approaches for shear velocity estimation. Currently, shear velocity estimation is accomplished by common industrial methods such as empirical equations, regression analysis, intelligent methods and rock-physics models (RPMs). The current study proposes that robust, accurate and cost-effective intelligent methods coupled with suitable RPM provide reasonable estimations of the shear velocity in an optimal processing time. Hybridizing intelligent models with RPMs in the framework of a committee machine is an optimal solution for shear velocity estimation of carbonate reservoirs. The intelligent methods used in this study include neural network (NN), fuzzy logic (FL) and an adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). In this research, for each individual intelligent model and a developed RPM, the optimal weights were allocated by Metaheuristic optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization routing (ACOR) and simulated annealing (SA)). To obtain the best results with the lowest mean squared error (MSE), a total of 9408, 10801 and 12288 models were created and tested in MATLAB to optimally parametrize the GA, ACOR and SA, respectively. The results showed that the combination of the applied intelligent models with the developed RPMs leads to a higher correlation coefficient with reference to the measured Shear velocity in test dataset. The use of a combination of intelligent methods in the form of committee-machine instead of individual methods has led to a reduction in error and improved the results by up to 2% Considering the high sensitivity of shear wave velocity in geomechanical and reservoir characterization studies, even small improvements in its estimation can significantly reduce error in the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

DE Multi-task attack; Adversarial sample; Relationship-preserving
   representation
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to adversarial samples that are carefully crafted to mislead the DNNs with imperceptible perturbations. To test the robustness of DNNs, attack methods based on adversarial samples have gained popularity due to their practicality and effectiveness in achieving encouraging attack results. However, most of these methods do not consider the more realistic multi-task attacks. The main challenge of multi-task attacks is that different tasks have different objective functions, making it difficult to find an optimal optimization goal to generate adversarial samples. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-task adversarial attack paradigm called Multi-Task Adversarial Attacks (MTAA) that uses a relationship preserving representation to learn adversarial patterns. Unlike previous methods, our attack method does not rely on a task-specific loss function or an attack agent model. Instead, we design a relationship-preserving module that projects samples into a low-dimensional embedding space while preserving their intrinsic geometric structure for adversarial pattern reasoning. This module effectively removes redundant information from high-dimensional features, providing an effective latent space for adversarial pattern reasoning. To learn adversarial representation in the latent space, we introduce a novel adversarial mechanism. Our attack method can deceive different networks on multiple tasks since it is independent of task-specific loss functions and the attack agent. Extensive experimental results show that our attack approach outperforms state-of-theart universal and transferable attack strategies on multi-task attacks. The codes for MTAA are available at https://github.com/antachen/MTAA.

AB The progress of the natural language understanding (NLU) community has put forward higher demands for the knowledge reserve and reasoning ability of the model. However, existing schemes for improving model capabilities often split them into two separate tasks. The task of enabling models to learn and reason about knowledge simultaneously has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we propose a novel crossword-based NLU task that imparts knowledge information to a model by solving crossword clues and simultaneously trains the model to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge. To this end, we construct a comprehensive crossword dataset SLR containing more than 4 million unique clue-answer pairs. Compared to existing crossword datasets, SLR is more comprehensive and contains linguistic knowledge, expertise in various fields, and commonsense knowledge. Meanwhile, to evaluate the reasoning ability of the model, we design clever details in the reasoning of the answers, most clues require the solver to reason through two or more pieces of knowledge to arrive at an answer. We analyze the composition of the dataset and the similarities and differences of the various types of clues via sampling and consider various data partitioning methods to enhance the generalization ability of the training set. Furthermore, we test the performance of several different advanced models and methods on this dataset and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each. An interesting conclusion is that even powerful language models perform poorly on tasks that require reasoning.

AB This paper proposes three novel accelerated inverse-free neurodynamic approaches to solve absolute value equations (AVEs). The first two are finite-time converging approaches and the third one is a fixed -time converging approach. It is shown that the proposed first two neurodynamic approaches converge to the solution of the concerned AVEs in a finite-time while, under some mild conditions, the third one converges to the solution in a fixed-time. It is also shown that the settling time for the proposed fixed-time converging approach has an uniform upper bound for all initial conditions, while the settling times for the proposed finite-time converging approaches are dependent on initial conditions. The proposed neurodynamic approaches have the advantage that they are all robust against bounded vanishing perturbations. The theoretical results are validated by means of a numerical example and an application in boundary value problems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY
AB Anomaly detection is the task of detecting samples that behave differently from the rest of the data or that include abnormal values. Unsupervised anomaly detection is the most common scenario, which implies that the algorithms cannot train with a labeled input and do not know the anomaly behavior beforehand. Histogram-based methods are one of the most approaches in unsupervised anomaly detec-tion, remarking a good performance and a low runtime. Despite the good performance, histogram-based anomaly detectors are not capable of processing data flows while updating their knowledge and cannot deal with a high amount of samples. In this paper, we propose a new histogram-based approach for addressing the aforementioned prob-lems by introducing the ability to update the information inside a histogram. We have applied these strategies to design a new algorithm called Multi-step Histogram Based Outlier Scores (MHBOS), includ-ing five new histogram update mechanisms. The results have shown the performance and validity of MHBOS as well as the proposed strategies in terms of performance and computing times. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Text2text question classification; Dynamic negative sampling; Supervised
   contrastive learning; Data augmentation
AB Text2text question classification (TQC), as a particular application case of question classification (QC), is of great practical value. Traditional QC methods usually label categories of questions using one or mul-tiple keywords provided by users. In contrast, in TQC, each question in natural language is automatically categorized into pre-designed standard question classes, which are coded in the form of short text. Because of this unique characteristic, TQC relies on a specifically designed framework and should be trained and validated based on customized experimental datasets. Previous TQC-related work mainly uti-lized textual similarity-matching methods. However, no effective pairwise learning paradigm has been proposed in TQC to model correlations between input text and classes; and the influence of distance met-rics and loss function in TQC has not been investigated. In this work, we propose a novel and comprehen-sive strategy, Augmented Dynamic Multi-layer Contrastive (ADMC), to resolve the challenge of TQC. Our framework consists of (1) an optional data augmentation module, (2) one stage for dynamic negative sampling, and (3) one stage for precise matching. The comprehensive TQC framework with ADMC strat-egy in this work resolves data imbalance and explores distance metrics learning via multiple augmenta-tion options and dynamic negative sampling based on multi-layer contrastive learning. To compensate for the shortage of public datasets for this task, we collected two real-world datasets and adaptively expanded three existing public datasets, which will be available after data masking. The results show that our ADMC outperformed other baseline methods investigated in this paper. The codes are available at https://github.com/WJULYW/ADMC. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to successfully create portfolio strategies in recent years. However, since financial markets are extremely noisy, past research has found it challenging to train a stable RL agent using historical data. In this work, we first apply a role-aware multi-agent system to model volatile security markets. Three major roles that are used in our system are presented, and while maximizing their own targets in the Taiwan stock exchange (TWSE) historical data, they also observe trading behavior and compete with other agents. To build a trading strategy, we construct a student-teacher framework in which multi-agent targeting distills the market information and a student RL model is taught using the distilled target. The results show that our method is capable of developing profitable strategies in a quickly changing financial market. In addition, our market distilling technique has the potential to develop a flexible asset allocation strategy by using different student networks.

ID CONSTRUCTION; INDUSTRY; DRIVEN; SYSTEM
AB The customized manufacturing process of complex products (with complex structures and production processes) involving randomness and dynamics, is facing the problem of high data management costs and data waste caused by the accumulation of massive amounts of information. Especially in the digital twin-based workshop, the highfidelity and interactive operation mechanism produces more massive data, aggravating the difficulty of data management. The combined effect of these complex manufacturing processes and dynamic batch production requirements poses a huge challenge to digital twin data management. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an updating method for digital twin knowledge based on a memorizing-forgetting model. Firstly, a multi-level representation model is proposed to fuse product, process flow, and manufacturing data. Secondly, the fused memorizing-forgetting model is proposed for dynamically updating digital twin knowledge. Finally, taking ship block manufacturing as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling and fusion analysis is proved by the visual analysis of its resources and process knowledge. Considering the dynamic nature of production, it is believed that the data management method will significantly help improve the refined control of workshop resources and manufacturing processes, as well as the efficient use of massive processing data.

AB In this paper, we present an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), for use in teaching the logic of computer programming and the programming language 'C'. The aim of the ITS is to adapt the delivered learning material and the lesson sequence to the knowledge level and learning needs of each individual student. The adaptation of the presented ITS is based on fuzzy logic and a machine learning technique. Particularly, the system uses the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm to detect the learner's knowledge level and abilities concerning computer programming during her/ his first interaction with the system. Next and during subsequent interactions of the learner with the system, fuzzy logic is used to identify the learner's current knowledge level and potential misconceptions. The system takes into consideration the knowledge dependencies that exist among the domain concepts of the learning material and, applying fuzzy rules, decides about the learning material that has to be delivered to the learner as well as the lesson sequence. The system has been fully implemented and evaluated through t-tests. The evaluation results show that the combination of machine learning (for initially identifying the student's learning abilities and needs) with fuzzy logic (for the continuous identification of the learner's current knowledge level and misconceptions) provides more personalized learning experience, promotes the active participation of students in the learning process and results in decrease in the number of dropouts.

AB We present a post-processing tool for semantic segmentation of Lidar point clouds, called LidarMetaSeg, which estimates the prediction quality segmentwise and classifies prediction errors. For this purpose, we compute dispersion measures based on network probability outputs as well as feature measures based on point cloud input features and aggregate them on segment level. These aggregated measures are used to train a meta classification model to predict whether a predicted segment is an error, i.e., it is a false positive or not. We also train a meta regression model to predict the segmentwise prediction quality in terms of intersection over union. Both models can then be applied to semantic segmentation inferences without knowing the ground truth. In our experiments we use different Lidar segmentation models and datasets and analyze the power of our method. We show that our results outperform other standard approaches based on single uncertainty measures like entropy. Furthermore, we present an in-depth evaluation of our method on predicted classes as well as on predicted categories.

AB The approach to question answering is challenging because it usually requires finding useful information from within and between question and answer sentences for sentence semantic matching. The key information mined from existing question and answer sentences, as a supplement to semantic information, maybe helpful for this task. However, capturing the intra-sentence and inter-sentence semantic interactions is somewhat difficult given the implicit interrelationships between question and answer sentences. Although the learning effect of multi-layer neural network is good, it lacks explanatory and theoretical support. This paper mainly studies how to select the best answer sentence from a set of question and answer sentences, mine information more effectively, perform semantic matching, and have a certain interpretability. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical attention network (QHAN) based on the mathematical framework of quantum theory, which integrates the attention mechanism under quantum measurement and density matrix (DMATT) and the attention mechanism under quantum weak measurement and weak value (WMATT) in one in a unified model framework. QHAN can not only discover key sentences in a set of question and answer sentences and key words in a sentence, but also perform sentence semantic matching quickly and accurately. Furthermore, QHAN has the advantage of interpretability in terms of models due to the physical meaning and attentional full weight distribution implied by quantum theory. Extensive experiments on the question answering dataset show that our method is comparable to the baselines and can explain why the selected question and answer sentence is the best option in terms of intra-sentence and inter-sentence attention distributions.

We argue that existing deterministic attacks, which perform by sequentially applying maximal perturbations on selected components of the input, fail at reaching accurate adversarial examples on real-world large scale datasets. By exploiting a simple Taylor expansion of the expected output probability under the noise perturbation, we introduce noise-based sparse (or L-0) targeted and untargeted attacks. Our proposed method, called Voting Folded Gaussian Attack (VFGA), achieves significantly better L-0 scores than state-of-the-art L-0 attacks (such as SparseFool and Sparse-RS) while being faster on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Moreover, we show that VFGA is also applicable as an L-8 attack and outperforms the state-of-the-art projected gradient attack (PGD) method.

AB This study explores the effects of class label noise on detecting fraud within three highly imbalanced healthcare fraud data sets containing millions of claims and minority class sizes as small as 0.1%. For each data set, 29 noise distributions are simulated by varying the level of class noise and the distribution of noise between the fraudulent and non-fraudulent classes. Four popular machine learning algorithms are evaluated on each noise distribution using six rounds of five-fold cross-validation. Performance is measured using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), true positive rate (TPR), and true negative rate (TNR) in order to understand the effect of the noise level, noise distribution, and their interactions. AUPRC results show that negative class noise, i.e. fraudulent samples incorrectly labeled as non-fraudulent, is the most detrimental to model performance. TPR and TNR results show that there are significant trade-offs in class-wise performance as noise transitions between the positive and the negative class. Finally, results reveal how overfitting negatively impacts the classification performance of some learners, and how simple regularization can be used to combat this overfitting and improve classification performance across all noise distributions.

DE Keyboard layout; genetic algorithm; neural network
AB Since the keyboard is the most common method for text input on computers today, the design of the keyboard layout is very significant. Despite the fact that the QWERTY keyboard layout was designed more than 100 years ago, it is still the predominant layout in use today. There have been several attempts to design better layouts, both manually and automatically. In this paper we improve on previous works on automatic keyboard layout optimization, by using a deep neural network to assist in a genetic search algorithm, which enables the use of a sophisticated keyboard evaluation function that would otherwise take a prohibitive amount of time. We also show that a better choice of crossover routine greatly improves the genetic search. Finally, in order to test how users with different levels of experience adapt to new keyboard layouts, we conduct some layout adaptation experiments with 300 participants to examine how users adapt to new keyboard layouts.

ID GENERATION
AB In the machine learning field, the technique known as ensemble learning aims at combining different base learners in order to increase the quality and the robustness of the predictions. Indeed, this approach has widely been applied to tackle, with success, real world problems from different domains, including computational biology. Nevertheless, despite their potential, ensembles combining results from different base learners have been understudied in the context of gene regulatory network inference. In this paper we applied genetic algorithms and frequent itemset mining, to design small but effective ensembles of gene regulatory network inference methods. These ensembles were evaluated and compared to well-established single and ensemble methods, on both real and synthetic datasets. Results showed that small ensembles, consisting of few but diverse base learners, enhance the exploration of the solution space, and compensate base learners biases, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Results advocate for the use of such methods as gene regulatory network inference tools.

DE Causal structure learning; normalized l(1) penalty; eigenvalue
   constraint; continuous optimization
AB Inferring causal relationships is key to data science. Learning causal structures in the form of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been widely adopted for uncovering causal relationships, nonetheless, it is a challenging task owing to its exponential search space. A recent approach formulates the structure learning problem as a continuous constrained optimization task that aims to learn causal relation matrix. Following it are nonlinear variants that can uncover nonlinear causal relationships. However, the nonlinear variant which considers the l(1) penalty as part of its optimization objective may not effectively eliminate false predictions. In this paper, we investigate the defect of the model that the l(1) penalty cannot effectively make the relation matrix sparse, thus introduces false predictions. Besides, the acyclicity constraint is unable to identify large circles within the margin of identification error, thus is unable to guarantee acyclicity of inferred causal relationships. Based on the theoretical and empirical analysis of the defects, we propose the normalized l(1) penalty which replaces the original l(1) penalty with a normalized first-order matrix norm, and propose a constraint based on eigenvalue to substitute the original acyclicity constraint. We then compare our proposed model NEC with three models to show considerable performance improvement. We further conduct experiments to show the effectiveness of the normalized l(1) penalty and the eigenvalue constraint.

   teaching practices; online education
AB Peer assessment, which requires students to evaluate their peers' submissions, has become the paradigm for solving the grading challenge of large-scale open-ended assignments teachers face in MOOCs. Since peer grades may be biased and unreliable, a group of probabilistic graph models are proposed to improve the estimation of true scores for assignments based on peer grades, by explicitly modeling the bias and reliability of each grader. However, these models assume that graders' reliability are only impacted by their knowledge/ ability levels while ignoring their grading behaviors. In real life, graders' grading behaviors (e.g., the time consumed for reviewing an assignment) reflect the seriousness of the graders in the assessment and greatly affect their reliability. Following this intuition, we propose two novel probabilistic graph models, named BPG(6) and BPG(7), for cardinal peer assessment, which optimize the modeling of the reliability of graders by incorporating various grading behaviors of them. Besides, we develop a peer assessment system, named BPA, which collects abundant grading behaviors of graders and thus facilitates the evaluation of the proposed models and our teaching practices. Experimental results on the collected datasets show the superiority of the proposed models in improving the estimation accuracy of the true scores of assignments by leveraging graders' grading behaviors. Finally, by analyzing the feedback from teaching practices of peer assessment using the BPA system, we not only prove the usability of the BPA system but also once again demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in peer assessment.

AB As an effective tool to solve continuous optimization problems, differential evolution (DE) algorithm has been widely used in numerous fields. To enhance the performance, in recent years, many DE variants have been developed based on the idea of multiple strategies. However, there still exists an issue for them that the strategy selection method relies on the historical search experience. The experience may be suitable for the problems with smooth fitness landscapes, but not for the problems with rugged fitness landscapes. To alleviate this issue, in this work, a new multiple strategies-based DE variant with dual information guidance is proposed, called DIGDE. In the DIGDE, to avoid the unreliable historical search experience, the fitness information and spatial information are utilized simultaneously as a guidance to estimate the evolutionary states for each individual, and then the most appropriate strategy can be chosen correspondingly. To verify the effectiveness of the DIGDE, 52 test functions are included in the experiments, and three well-established DE variants and four other evolutionary algorithms are involved in the performance comparison. The results show that the DIGDE achieves competitive performance on not only the result accuracy but also the convergence rate.

AB This paper addresses a manpower allocation and vehicle routing problem with staff qualifications and time windows (MAVRP-SQTW), which is an extension of the manpower allocation and vehicle routing problem. This problem focuses on developing an optimal schedule for integrated staff assignment and vehicle routing in transportation systems to minimize outsourcing costs and travel costs. We first formulate this problem as an arc-flow model. Then, we design a branch-and-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm based on a set-packing model for MAVRP-SQTW. To accelerate the column generation process, we apply the bounded bidirectional search and the decremental state-space relaxation. Meanwhile, we utilize subset-row inequalities to tighten the master model. Numerical results based on the modified Solomon's instances show that our set-packing model solved by the BPC significantly outperforms the arc-flow model solved by CPLEX. Sensitivity analyses show that the numbers of vehicles and staff members as well as the number of staff types have great effects on the performance of the BPC. Results also suggest that the BPC can be able to optimally solve some instances with 70 requests, but solving large-scale instances is still the limitation of the BPC. Thus, we further develop a primal heuristic to improve the efficiency of solving large-scale instances and obtain relatively good solutions.

AB Water leakage typically infiltrates through bolt holes and segment joints, posing a threat to the stability of tunnel structures. In this paper, we develop a copula-based Bayesian network (CBN) method for dependency modeling of complex systems to conduct risk analysis and management of water leakage in operational tunnels. Thirteen potential factors are used to construct the water leakage risk system, and the permeate water volume is selected as the observation index of water leakage risk. An application to a realistic cross-river tunnel of Wuhan Rail Transit Line 3 is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the developed model. Through correlation analysis, the bolt failure rate and seal breakage and aging rate are diagnosed as critical factors with the greatest impact on the water leakage risk. Forward and backward reasoning enables the model to be dynamically updated to provide decision support for water leakage risk management. This research contributes to the following: (a) expressing the dependence of the factors affecting water leakage; (b) solving the problem of modeling uncertainty and information fusion; and (c) updating the model to realize the safety control of tunnel water leakage.

AB The design and implementation of adaptive chemical reaction networks, capable of adjusting their behavior over time in response to experience, is a key goal for the fields of molecular computing and DNA nanotechnology. Mainstream machine learning research offers powerful tools for implementing learning behavior that could one day be realized in a wet chemistry system. Here we develop an abstract chemical reaction network model that implements the backpropagation learning algorithm for a feedforward neural network whose nodes employ the nonlinear "leaky rectified linear unit" transfer function. Our network directly implements the mathematics behind this well-studied learning algorithm, and we demonstrate its capabilities by training the system to learn a linearly inseparable decision surface, specifically, the XOR logic function. We show that this simulation quantitatively follows the definition of the underlying algorithm. To implement this system, we also report ProBioSim, a simulator that enables arbitrary training protocols for simulated chemical reaction networks to be straightforwardly defined using constructs from the host programming language. This work thus provides new insight into the capabilities of learning chemical reaction networks and also develops new computational tools to simulate their behavior, which could be applied in the design and implementations of adaptive artificial life.

AB Plants thrive in virtually all natural and human-adapted environments and are becoming popular models for developing robotics systems because of their strategies of morphological and behavioral adaptation. Such adaptation and high plasticity offer new approaches for designing, modeling, and controlling artificial systems acting in unstructured scenarios. At the same time, the development of artifacts based on their working principles reveals how plants promote innovative approaches for preservation and management plans and opens new applications for engineering-driven plant science. Environmentally mediated growth patterns (e.g., tropisms) are clear examples of adaptive behaviors displayed through morphological phenotyping. Plants also create networks with other plants through subterranean roots-fungi symbiosis and use these networks to exchange resources or warning signals. This article discusses the functional behaviors of plants and shows the close similarities with a perceptron-like model that could act as a behavior-based control model in plants. We begin by analyzing communication rules and growth behaviors of plants; we then show how we translated plant behaviors into algorithmic solutions for bioinspired robot controllers; and finally, we discuss how those solutions can be extended to embrace original approaches to networking and robotics control architectures.

ID ANTHROPOMORPHISM; MIND
AB Much research in robotic artificial intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life has focused on autonomous agents as an embodied and situated approach to AI. Such systems are commonly viewed as overcoming many of the philosophical problems associated with traditional computationalist AI and cognitive science, such as the grounding problem (Harnad) or the lack of intentionality (Searle), because they have the physical and sensorimotor grounding that traditional AI was argued to lack. Robot lawn mowers and self-driving cars, for example, more or less reliably avoid obstacles, approach charging stations, and so on-and therefore might be considered to have some form of artificial intentionality or intentional directedness. It should be noted, though, that the fact that robots share physical environments with people does not necessarily mean that they are situated in the same perceptual and social world as humans. For people encountering socially interactive systems, such as social robots or automated vehicles, this poses the nontrivial challenge to interpret them as intentional agents to understand and anticipate their behavior but also to keep in mind that the intentionality of artificial bodies is fundamentally different from their natural counterparts. This requires, on one hand, a "suspension of disbelief " but, on the other hand, also a capacity for the "suspension of belief." This dual nature of (attributed) artificial intentionality has been addressed only rather superficially in embodied AI and social robotics research. It is therefore argued that Bourgine and Varela's notion of Artificial Life as the practice of autonomous systems needs to be complemented with a practice of socially interactive autonomous systems, guided by a better understanding of the differences between artificial and biological bodies and their implications in the context of social interactions between people and technology.

AB This article tackles the topic of the special issue "Biology in AI: New Frontiers in Hardware, Software and Wetware Modeling of Cognition" in two ways. It addresses the problem of the relevance of hardware, software, and wetware models for the scientific understanding of biological cognition, and it clarifies the contributions that synthetic biology, construed as the synthetic exploration of cognition, can offer to artificial intelligence (AI). The research work proposed in this article is based on the idea that the relevance of hardware, software, and wetware models of biological and cognitive processes-that is, the concrete contribution that these models can make to the scientific understanding of life and cognition-is still unclear, mainly because of the lack of explicit criteria to assess in what ways synthetic models can support the experimental exploration of biological and cognitive phenomena. Our article draws on elements from cybernetic and autopoietic epistemology to define a framework of reference, for the synthetic study of life and cognition, capable of generating a set of assessment criteria and a classification of forms of relevance, for synthetic models, able to overcome the sterile, traditional polarization of their evaluation between mere imitation and full reproduction of the target processes. On the basis of these tools, we tentatively map the forms of relevance characterizing wetware models of living and cognitive processes that synthetic biology can produce and outline a programmatic direction for the development of "organizationally relevant approaches" applying synthetic biology techniques to the investigative field of (embodied) AI.

AB In this paper, based on terminal sliding mode control (TSMC), a cooperative impact time and angle constrained guidance (CITACG) law for multi-missile system with switching network topologies is proposed. The obtained CITACG is composed of two parts. One part is designed to make the missiles intercept the target from their predetermined impact angles. And the other part's goal is to make the multiple missiles intercept the target simultaneously without predefining a common impact time. Sliding mode surface of the first part is designed based on TSMC, meanwhile integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) and graph theory are applied to derive the second part of the CITACG. When the communication network switches between the connected topology and the disconnected one, a Lyapunov candidate function is introduced and the corresponding stability conditions are derived. The proposed guidance law is the summation of the two guidance parts, therefore it is a direct method and do not have to switch the guidance command between the impact angle constrained guidance law and the impact time constrained guidance law. The predetermined common impact time is not required in the proposed CITACG, and the missiles can automatically adjust themselves to intercept the target simultaneously by communicating between their neighbors. Numerical simulations demonstrate the great performance of the proposed guidance law.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation and control modules often integrate as much sensory data as possible to increase accuracy in estimating pose and velocity. Visual odometry can be a good complement for robot localization when it navigates in challenging underwater scenarios, such as those colonized with seagrass or algae. Thanks to the wide variety of cameras available on the market, their increased performance and moderated cost; this type of sensor now can be used in marine robots. The work proposed in this paper increases the robustness of contemporary feature-based visual odometers for application in such environments by evolving a state-of-the-art approach; ensuring the tracking of visual keypoints that are geometrically and photometrically invariant, highly distinguishable, and exhibit strong repeatability. Experimental results, obtained from visual datasets captured by a stereoscopic camera installed on an AUV while performing different missions in large areas of the Balearic Islands with special ecological interest, show the improvement of this proposal with respect to other approaches already available and its feasibility to be used online.

ID MANAGEMENT
AB BIM standard development is central to the performance and behavior of BIM model application across transmission, visualization, and information management perspectives. Tremendous effort has been made to ease the implementation of IFC data model in practice. Yet, the complexity of IFC data model hurdles the implementation of the import and export functionality by software vendors. To overcome this, buildingSMART introduced the concept of Model View Definitions to define which parts of an IFC data model need to be implemented for a specific data exchange scenario. With such, the certification of compatibility for software products with the IFC standard is formed. The Model View Definition is use case orientated to determine whether the specific information should be included in an IFC partial model. With the creation of ad-hoc, project-specific Exchange Requirements increasing, associated MVD development requires much more work to incorporate standard development. To resolve this issue, this paper attempts to exploit the potential of information entropy which has proven itself extremely crucial in many other industries in terms of information management, and then integrates it with sandpile simulation to propose a Top-down hierarchy to structure as well as interpret IFC partial model via Model View Definition. The proposed information entropy shifted MVD development approach would manage to unify the MVD development process that enables the reduction on confusion for various end users, specific organization, or project needs. Moreover, to better translate the BIM standard topology into sandpile simulations, a new notion system is proposed. Sandpile simulations are further implemented to prove their applicability, during the simulation, self-organized criticality is identified, and the existence of chaos is observed.

AB With the development of digital city and smart city construction, the City Information Model (CIM) has played a critical role as a container of spatial-temporal data to establish the Digital Twin City. For a digital twin city, a virtual high-fidelity CIM model that corresponds closely to the real physical world is the premise and cornerstone of its construction. Therefore, the integration of BIM, GIS and IoT has become the preferred topic for researchers and has received much more attention from a wide academic circle. However, traditional integration mainly focuses on the conversion of both IFC and CityGML, and IoT data are also often used as visualizations. More importantly, the underlying data formats of GIS, BIM and IoT are still independent of each other without a unified data structure expression, so real data-driven analysis and decision-making cannot be implemented. This study aims to establish a general CIM ontology to integrate heterogeneous BIM, GIS and IoT data. First, the related work of BIM, GIS and IoT integration is studied and analyzed. A comparison of three mainstream approaches, data conversion, standard extension and data linking, is conducted, and it illustrates the advantages of ontology techniques in solving data interoperability problems. Second, a technical framework of BIM, GIS and IoT data integration based on ontology technology is proposed. The approach is mainly divided into five steps: geometry processing, data instantiation, ontology construction, ontology mapping and querying application. On the basis of the CIM ontology, an application ontology is built for a specific application domain to illustrate rulebased mapping, querying and inferring. Finally, the case study shows that the Ontology-based methodology in this paper has contributed to establish a general pattern for CIM data integration by mapping and linking concepts from the semantic level. It avoids changes in the original data sources and the missing data problem.

AB This paper considers motion control of a slung load system (SLS) which consists of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a slung load with a cable. This paper addresses the problem of tracking smooth payload position and UAV yaw trajectories. We design an output-tracking controller which can be used on a large practical region of state space and which has locally exponentially stable (ES) error dynamics. The method uses exact dynamic state-feedback linearization, and the controller expression is derived using the dynamic extension algorithm (DEA). Flatness relations are used to determine conditions for reference trajectories which avoid singularities. The proposed design achieves error dynamics which is ES in the presence of constant force and torque disturbance acting on the UAV. Finally, the proposed control law is compared to a geometric output-tracking design through numerical simulations, and the advantages of the proposed method are highlighted including its ease of tuning and disturbance robustness.

AB This paper is an extension of [1] and builds on the results in [2] and [1], and investigates the effect of a Social Value Orientation (SVO) parameter on the target capturing problem in an ellipsoidal region by a swarm composed of quadrotor agents. Social Value Orientation is a concept taken from social psychology which has not been studied from the perspective of control of multi-agent systems. Here SVO is encoded as a parameter in the control protocol, resulting in different agent behaviors or in a sense different agent personalities such as social (swarming), prosocial or asocial (selfish) agents. It is guaranteed that agents eventually enter a user-defined ellipsoidal ring around the target and the target will be captured/enclosed. The obtained results show that agents with different personalities act differently while moving towards the target and have different steady-state behaviours or configurations. In particular, selfish agents converge to steady state faster than their more social counterparts. In contrast, social agents interact more with the swarm, and therefore, they stay more cohesive but converge slower to steady state. We present analytical derivations as well as simulations with agents with quadcopter dynamics for both stationary and moving targets.

AB In this paper, in order to enhance the trajectory tracking effect of collaborative robot joint modules, a practical model-based robust control method with simple parameter adjustment is proposed. Firstly, in order to keep the nominal mechanical system stable, a nominal controller is established using the dynamics model. Secondly, a robust controller is established using the Lyapunov method to limit the impact of uncertainties on dynamic performance. Through theoretical analysis, it is proved that the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the system are ensured by the controller. In addition, based on the actual experimental equipment, a prototype of rapid controller CSPACE is designed, which can quickly repeat the experiment and greatly enhance the experimental efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness and realizability of the controller are verified by virtual simulation and experimental results.

AB This paper introduces an approach for estimating evoked categories expression from videos with the temporal position fusion. Pre-trained models on large-scale datasets in computer vision and audio sig-nals were used to extract the deep representation for timestamps in the video. A temporal convolution network, rather than an RNN-like architecture, was applied to explore temporal relationships due to its advantage in memory consumption and parallelism. Furthermore, to address the noise labels, the tempo-ral position was fused with the deep learned feature to ensure the network differentiates the time steps when noise labels were removed from the training set. This technique helps the system gain a consider-able improvement compared to other methods. We conducted experiments on EEV, a large-scale dataset for evoked expression from videos, and achieved a score of 0.054 in terms of Pearson correlation coeffi-cient as a state-of-the-art result. Further experiments on a sub set of LIRIS-ACCEDE dataset -MediaEval 2018 benchmark, also demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the trend of lightweight in the field of intelligent electric vehicles and 3C, the demand for high precision machining of aluminum alloy parts is growing. And tool condition monitoring (TCM) is very important for quality control of parts, so intelligent high-accuracy wear prediction of aluminum alloy high precision machining tools has great industrial application value at present and in the future. This paper presents a novel TCM model (Conv-PhyFormer) of Transformer with physics informed. The model has excellent ability to capture short-term and long-term dependencies from nonlinear cutting time series data when there are few training samples. The embedded hard physical constraint and soft physical constraint in the model make the model partially interpretable. Soft physical constraint in the form of one-dimensional causal convolution can help the proposed model better learn the local context. Hard physical constraint in the form of the mathematical equation representing cutting physical knowledge are embedded, thus the model does not need to learn this knowledge from time series data from scratch. A large number of analysis results of aluminum alloy machining experimental data show that the proposed Conv-PhyFormer has significantly superior prediction accuracy and robustness compared with the current three popular deep learning models for TCM. Embedded soft and hard physical constraints can significantly reduce the training epochs of Transformer prediction model.

AB In conditionally automated driving, traffic safety problems would occur if the driver does not properly take over the control authority when the request of automated system arises. Therefore, this study proposes XGBoost learning method considering risk potential field to predict the takeover quality in conditionally automated driving under different levels of cognitive non-driving related tasks (NDRTs). Thirty participants drive on two experimental conditions: manual driving is following an automated driving during which the driver is asked to perform NDRTs. Drivers' physiological features of different cognitive states are exploited to model multi-level takeover quality prediction. This investigation also gives an insight into the main effects of the selected prediction variables on the takeover quality. The proposed model performance within different time windows is assessed using multiple evaluation metrics and compared with other methods. Results show that the prediction accuracy within the time windows of 7-10 s, 5-7 s, 3-5 s and 1-3 s is 0.87, 0.85, 0.85 and 0.90, respectively. The XGBoost model has the best performance of different time windows under each level of takeover quality compared to the other three machine learning models. Our findings can effectively predict the takeover quality and assist automated driving safely in interactions between drivers and automated vehicles.

AB Normalization techniques are essential for accelerating the training and improving the generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs), and have successfully been used in various applications. This paper reviews and comments on the past, present and future of normalization methods in the context of DNN training. We provide a unified picture of the main motivation behind different approaches from the perspective of optimization, and present a taxonomy for understanding the similarities and differences between them. Specifically, we decompose the pipeline of the most representative normalizing activation methods into three components: the normalization area partitioning, normalization operation and normalization representation recovery. In doing so, we provide insight for designing new normalization technique. Finally, we discuss the current progress in understanding normalization methods, and provide a comprehensive review of the applications of normalization for particular tasks, in which it can effectively solve the key issues.

AB The single image de-snowing task is an essential topic in computer vision, as images captured on snowy days degrade the performance of current vision-based intelligent systems. Existing methods build complex network structures with numerous parameters to pursue continuous performance improvement. Nonetheless, they generally ignore the negative impact of large memory consumption in real applications. This paper aims to address the above problem by making a trade-off between network capacity and performance. We propose two novel networks suitable for different application scenarios. For devices with small memory and requiring fast inference speed, we propose an extremely lightweight recursive network (XLRNet). XLRNet is constructed by a single recursive strategy and two novel lightweight modules. For devices with large memory and pursuing better de-snowing performance, we propose a coupled lightweight dual recursive network (CLDRNet). CLDRNet cascades two XLRNets by a novel dual recursive strategy and a novel dual coupled LSTM module (DC-LSTM). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our two models on three synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Machines can make an appropriate operating and maintenance choice when defects are accurately and promptly predicted. Researchers choose data-driven predictive maintenance techniques for making the prediction more quickly and economically than alternative methods. To maintain secure and dependable manufacturing operations, the production equipment needs predictive maintenance. It is crucial to have an efficient predictive maintenance model for preventing unexpected shutdown by defects during production. The majority of related research focuses on early fault warnings but ignores how different issues differ in severity. Making the right maintenance policy is extremely important for a manufacturing organization because maintenance affects employee safety, economy, reliability, and availability. To solve these difficulties in the automotive sector, an efficient predictive maintenance strategy with deep structured architecture is offered to predict faults in the machines and increase the lifespan of the equipment. Firstly, the required data is collected from external sources for the predictive maintenance system. The garnered data is given to the pre-processing section and the transformation stage. Secondly, the transformed data is subjected to the autoencoder for selecting the optimal encoded vectors with the Henry Gas Solubility Search and Rescue Optimization (HGSSRO). The selected features are given to deep hybrid learning with Serial Cascaded Deep Learning (SCDL) to predict the occurrence of faults. Here, the autoencoder obtains the encoded vectors from the optimally selected features. Then, the optimal encoded vectors are subjected to the LSTM to acquire the features. The extracted features are given to DNN for the final prediction of failures. In this hybrid SCDL, the variables are optimized by the same HGSSRO to improve the prediction performance. The efficacy of the developed deep learning-aided predictive system is validated ed by comparing the conventional prediction models.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; PREFERENCES; SEARCH
AB In practical multicriterion decision making, it is cumbersome if a decision maker (DM) is asked to choose among a set of tradeoff alternatives covering the whole Pareto-optimal front. This is a paradox in conventional evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) that always aim to achieve a well balance between convergence and diversity. In essence, the ultimate goal of multiobjective optimization is to help a DM identify solution(s) of interest (SOI) achieving satisfactory tradeoffs among multiple conflicting criteria. Bearing this in mind, this article develops a framework for designing preference-based EMO algorithms to find SOI in an interactive manner. Its core idea is to involve human in the loop of EMO. After every several iterations, the DM is invited to elicit her feedback with regard to a couple of incumbent candidates. By collecting such information, her preference is progressively learned by a learning-to-rank neural network and then applied to guide the baseline EMO algorithm. Note that this framework is so general that any existing EMO algorithm can be applied in a plug-in manner. Experiments on 48 benchmark test problems with up to ten objectives and a real-world multiobjective robot control problem fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms for finding SOI.

AB In traditional data stream mining, classification models are typically trained on labeled samples from a single source. However, in real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate labels is very hard and expensive, especially, when multiple data streams are concurrently sampled from an environment or the same process. To address this issue, multistream classification is proposed, in which a data stream with biased labels (called the source stream) is leveraged to train a suitable model for prediction over another stream with unlabeled samples (called the target stream). Despite the growing research in this field, previous multistream classification methods are mostly designed for single-source stream scenarios. However, various source streams contain diverse data distributions, providing more valuable information for building a more accurate model. In addition, previous works construct classification models in the original shared feature space, ignoring the effect of redundant or low-quality features on the classification performance. This may produce inefficient knowledge transfer across streams. In view of this, a reduced-space multistream classification based on multiobjective evolutionary optimization is proposed in this article. First, a multiobjective evolutionary optimization is employed to seek the most valuable feature subset shared in the source and target domains, with the purpose of narrowing the distribution difference between source and target streams. Following that, a Gaussian mixture model-based weighting mechanism for source samples is presented. More especially, two drift adaptation methods are proposed to address asynchronous drift. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms other comparative methods on classification accuracy and G-mean.

AB With the emergence of deep neural networks, many research fields, such as image classification, object detection, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, and automatic driving, have made major breakthroughs in technology and the research achievements have been successfully applied in many real-life applications. Combining evolutionary computation and neural architecture search (NAS) is an important approach to improve the performance of deep neural networks. Usually, the related researchers only focus on precision. Thus, the searched neural architectures always perform poorly in the other indexes such as time cost. In this article, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a probability stack (MOEA-PS) is proposed for NAS, which considers the two objects of precision and time consumption. MOEA-PS uses an adjacency list to represent the internal structure of deep neural networks. Besides, a unique mechanism is introduced into the multi-objective genetic algorithm to guide the process of crossover and mutation when generating offspring. Furthermore, the structure blocks are stacked using a proxy model to generate deep neural networks. The results of the experiments on Cifar-10 and Cifar-100 demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has a similar error rate compared with the most advanced NAS algorithms, but the time cost is lower. Finally, the network structure searched on Cifar-10 is transferred directly to the ImageNet dataset, which can achieve 73.6% classification accuracy.

AB In contrast to the traditional feature selection (FS), local FS (LFS) partitions the whole sample space and obtains the feature subset for each local region. However, most existing LFS algorithms lack a problem-specific objective function and instead simply apply the distance-like objective function, which limits their classification performance. In addition, obtaining a good LFS model is essentially a multiobjective optimization problem. Therefore, in this article, we propose a region purity (RP)-based LFS (RP-LFS) where, besides the proportion of the selected features and region-based distance metric, we design a novel objective function, RP, from the perspective of combining local features with classifiers. To solve the RP-LFS, an improved nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III is proposed. Specifically, a network-inspired crossover operator and a quick bit mutation are applied, which can improve the ability to search for better solutions. A regional feature sharing strategy between different local models is developed, which can preserve more effective features. Experimental studies on 11 UCI datasets and nine high-dimensional datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed RP. In comparison with various state-of-the-art FS and LFS algorithms, RP-LFS can achieve very competitive classification accuracy while obtaining a reduced feature subset size.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Recently, evolutionary multitasking (EMT) has been successfully used in the field of high-dimensional classification. However, the generation of multiple tasks in the existing EMT-based feature selection (FS) methods is relatively simple, using only the Relief- F method to collect related features with similar importance into one task, which cannot provide more diversified tasks for knowledge transfer. Thus, this article devises a new EMT algorithm for FS in high-dimensional classification, which first adopts different filtering methods to produce multiple tasks and then modifies a competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) to efficiently solve these related tasks via knowledge transfer. First, a diversified multiple task generation method is designed based on multiple filtering methods, which generates several relevant low-dimensional FS tasks by eliminating irrelevant features. In this way, useful knowledge for solving simple and relevant tasks can be transferred to simplify and speed up the solution of the original high-dimensional FS task. Then, a CSO is modified to simultaneously solve these relevant FS tasks by transferring useful knowledge among them. Numerous empirical results demonstrate that the proposed EMT-based FS method can obtain a better feature subset than several state-of-the-art FS methods on 18 high-dimensional datasets.

AB Multiview data analysis provides an effective means to integrate the distinct information sources which are inherent to many applications. Data clustering in a multiview setting specifically aims to identify the most appropriate grouping for a collection of entities, where those entities (or their relationships) can be described from multiple perspectives. Leveraging recent advances in multiobjective clustering, we propose a new evolutionary method to tackle this challenge. Designed around a flexible and unbiased solution representation, together with strategies based on the minimum spanning tree and neighborhood relations, our algorithm optimizes multiple objectives simultaneously to effectively explore the space of candidate tradeoffs between the data views. Through a series of experiments, we investigate the suitability of our proposal in the context of a bioinformatics application, clustering of plausible protein structures, and a diverse set of synthetic problems. The specific case of two data views is considered in this article. The evaluation with respect to a variety of reference approaches demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in discovering high-quality partitions in a multiview setting. Robustness against unreliable data sources and the ability to automatically determine the number of clusters are additional advantages evidenced by the results obtained.

TI Query-Efficient Generation of Adversarial Examples for Defensive DNNs

DE Black-box adversarial example (AE); defensive deep neural networks
   (DNNs); genetic algorithm (GA); multiobjective optimization
AB Due to the inherent vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs), the adversarial example (AE) attack has become a serious threat to intelligent systems, e.g., the failure cause of an image classification system. Different to existing works, in this article we are interested in the generation of AEs for DNNs with defensive mechanisms. To make the attack more practical, we exploit a query-based method to generate image AEs in a black-box attack setting. Considering that the generation of AEs is inherently a constrained optimization problem, this article first formulates three objectives regarding defensive DNNs, i.e., attack effectiveness, attack evasiveness and attack coverage. Then, this article proposes a query-efficient AE attack based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address the perturbation optimization problem. To improve the efficiency of search and query, AE-specific operators including block-level and pixel-level crossovers, discrete perturbation mutation and direction-driven reproduction are designed within the GA-based search framework. In addition, predication-based adaptation of reproduction-related parameters is implemented to speed up the search convergence. PSO-based jumping process is further devised to avoid stuck in local optimum. Benchmark-based experiments evaluated the efficiency of our method, which can achieve an attack success rate of 100% with averagely 52.95% reduced queries in contrast to existing black-box attacks on nondefensive models. For defensive DNN models, our method can obtain top attack performance with the query reduction up to 70.92% comparing with the candidates.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In the literature of mitigating unfairness in machine learning (ML), many fairness measures are designed to evaluate predictions of learning models and also utilized to guide the training of fair models. It has been theoretically and empirically shown that there exist conflicts and inconsistencies among accuracy and multiple fairness measures. Optimizing one or several fairness measures may sacrifice or deteriorate other measures. Two key questions should be considered: 1) how to simultaneously optimize accuracy and multiple fairness measures and 2) how to optimize all the considered fairness measures more effectively. In this article, we view the mitigating unfairness problem as a multiobjective learning problem, considering the conflicts among fairness measures. A multiobjective evolutionary learning framework is used to simultaneously optimize several metrics (including accuracy and multiple fairness measures) of ML models. Then, ensembles are constructed based on the learning models in order to automatically balance different metrics. Empirical results on eight well-known datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness, our proposed algorithm can provide decision makers with better tradeoffs among accuracy and multiple fairness metrics. Furthermore, the high-quality models generated by the framework can be used to construct an ensemble to automatically achieve a better tradeoff among all the considered fairness metrics than other ensemble methods.

TI Evolutionary Multitasking for Large-Scale Multiobjective Optimization

ID ALGORITHM; SEARCH
AB Evolutionary transfer optimization (ETO) has been becoming a hot research topic in the field of evolutionary computation, which is based on the fact that knowledge learning and transfer across the related optimization exercises can improve the efficiency of others. However, rare studies employ ETO to solve large-scale multiobjective optimization problems (LMOPs). To fill this research gap, this article proposes a new multitasking ETO algorithm via a powerful transfer learning model to simultaneously solve multiple LMOPs. In particular, inspired by adversarial domain adaptation in transfer learning, a discriminative reconstruction network (DRN) model (containing an encoder, a decoder, and a classifier) is created for each LMOP. At each generation, the DRN is trained by the currently obtained nondominated solutions for all LMOPs via backpropagation with gradient descent. With this well-trained DRN model, the proposed algorithm can transfer the solutions of source LMOPs directly to the target LMOP for assisting its optimization, can evaluate the correlation between the source and target LMOPs to control the transfer of solutions, and can learn a dimensional-reduced Pareto-optimal subspace of the target LMOP to improve the efficiency of transfer optimization in the large-scale search space. Moreover, we propose a real-world multitasking LMOP suite to simulate the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on multiple different classification tasks. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been validated in this real-world problem suite and the other two synthetic problem suites.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; ALGORITHM
AB Air pollution causes around 400 000 premature deaths per year in Europe due to Particulate Matter, nitrogen oxides, and ground-level ozone pollutants. Multiple-input multiple-output nonlinear auto-regressive exogenous deep neural networks are frequently used to predict a day before, air-quality pollution incidents, at a country scale. With complexity and data sizes increasing, finding performant models becomes harder. We propose island transpeciation to optimize hyperparameters and architectures. Unlike using a single optimizer, island transpeciation combines results from multiple optimizers, to consistently provide excellent performance. Moreover, we show that island transpeciation outperforms random model search and other previous modeling efforts. Island transpeciation is a neural architecture search that uses co-evolution (genes), to combine (transpeciation) populations of incompatible optimizers (species) organized in island formations. In island transpeciation, architecture search is parallelized and utilizes a distributed pool of hardware resources. We have successfully used these techniques to predict next-day ozone concentrations across the Belgian territory.

ID SEARCH
AB Discretization-based feature selection (DBFS) approaches have shown interesting results when using several metaheuristic algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), etc. However, these methods share the same shortcoming which consists in encoding the problem solution as a sequence of cut-points. From this cut-points vector, the decision of deleting or selecting any feature is induced. Indeed, the number of generated cut-points varies from one feature to another. Thus, the higher the number of cut-points, the higher the probability of selecting the considered feature; and vice versa. This fact leads to the deletion of possibly important features having a single or a low number of cut-points, such as the infection rate, the glycemia level, and the blood pressure. In order to solve the issue of the dependency relation between the feature selection (or removal) event and the number of its generated potential cut-points, we propose to model the DBFS task as a bilevel optimization problem and then solve it using an improved version of an existing co-evolutionary algorithm, named I-CEMBA. The latter ensures the variation of the number of features during the migration process in order to deal with the multimodality aspect. The resulting algorithm, termed bilevel discretization-based feature selection (Bi-DFS), performs selection at the upper level while discretization is done at the lower level. The experimental results on several high-dimensional datasets show that Bi-DFS outperforms relevant state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy, generalization ability, and feature selection bias.

AB Expensive constraint multimodal optimization problems (ECMMOPs) have such characteristics as expensive objectives and constraints, and multiple optimal modalities simultaneously, which pose severe challenges to evolutionary optimization methods. This article studies an objective-constraint mutual-guided surrogate-assisted particle swarm optimization algorithm for the kind of problem, aiming to discover multiple competing feasible optimal solutions at a lower calculation cost. The algorithm designs first a new two-layer cooperative surrogate model framework based on heterogeneous database to effectively adjust the prediction accuracies of objective surrogates and constraint surrogates on different search regions. An objective-constraint mutual-guided partial evaluation strategy (O-C-PES) is developed to generate high-quality infilling samples for objective and constraint surrogates, respectively, based on which the number of unnecessary real evaluations can be significantly reduced. Moreover, a position feature-guided hybrid update mechanism (PF-HUM) is proposed to find more optimal solutions by searching excellent infeasible and feasible areas at the same time, and a feasible ratio-driven local search (FR-LS) strategy is proposed to improve the algorithm's exploitation. Compared with four existing surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and one constraint multimodal EAs on 21 benchmark problems and three engineering instances, experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can simultaneously obtain multiple highly-competitive feasible optimal solutions with less computational cost.

AB The practicality of Pareto-dominance in solving many-objective optimization problems becomes questionable due to its inability to factor the critical human decision-making (HDM) elements, including the number of better objectives, the degree of betterment in objectives, and objectives' relative preference. Relevant dominance principles are recently proposed to incorporate the first two HDM elements, often with the need for new tunable parameters. This article proposes a high-fidelity-dominance principle that factors all the three HDM elements, explicitly and simultaneously, and without requiring tuning of any parameter. This principle has been implemented in a reference-vector-based framework, leading to a computationally efficient many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA), namely, localized high-fidelity-dominance-based EA (LHFiD). Critically, LHFiD also has an inbuilt mechanism for on-the-fly determination of the timing for: 1) intermittent Nadir point estimation that enables faster convergence and 2) its self-termination that bears practically utility. This article is based on an extensive study involving 41 912 experiments, in which the proposed LHFiD approach is compared with the existing competitive MaOEAs. This article reports statistically better performance in about 60% instances, making it practical and worthy of further investigation and application.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; LINEAR CONVERGENCE; STRATEGIES; SEARCH
AB The theory of evolutionary algorithms on continuous space gravitates around the evolution strategy with one individual, adaptive mutation, and elitist selection, optimizing the symmetric, quadratic SPHERE function. The classic, normal mutation theory consists of three main building-blocks: 1) a two-term formula for the local (constant mutation) expected progress; 2) an exponential formula for the global behavior of the (adaptive mutation) algorithm; and 3) linear convergence time with respect to both space dimension $n$ and (logarithm of) initial distance to optimum. We show that the three main results still hold if we replace the normal mutation with uniform inside the sphere and also with the sum of two uniforms. That makes the case for an important conclusion: the linear convergence time of the algorithm is not a consequence of the normal mutation, but of the elitist selection and 1/5 success rule. A simplified version of the 1/5-rule allows also for an intuitive representation of the algorithm, as a sequence of constant-mutation, independent, and identical (expected) length cycles.

ID OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; CONSTRUCTION; INFORMATION
AB The evolutionary algorithm recommendation is catching increasing attention when solving practical application problems since different algorithms often perform differently on different problems. To achieve the algorithm recommendation, extracting effective features to accurately characterize the problems is necessary, which is related to the feature extraction problem. So far, most feature extraction methods focus on single-objective optimization problems, and only a few studies are conducted on multiobjective optimization problems and constrained optimization problems, let alone constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs) that are widely encountered in the real world. To fill the gap, this article proposes an evolution-based constrained multiobjective feature extraction method (ECMOFE), in which the information generated in the evolutionary process is leveraged to form the feature matrix. To be specific, we create two populations to, respectively, optimize constraints and objectives for some generations. Furthermore, two complementary evolutionary operators are used to generate offspring for each population. In the environmental selection, the successful rate of offspring individuals generated by each operator of each population is recorded to form the feature matrix. Then, a dimension reduction method is designed to compress the size of the feature matrix. By the above process, the feature vector that can reflect the global relationship between constraints and objectives and the difficulty of the CMOP is formed. Based on the formed features, several algorithm recommendation methods are built on the basis of classifiers. The results based on multiple metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed ECMOFE.

AB Large-scale optimization problems (LSOPs) are challenging because the algorithm is difficult in balancing too many dimensions and in escaping from trapped bottleneck dimensions. To improve solutions, this article introduces targeted modification to the certain values in the bottleneck dimensions. Analogous to gene targeting (GT) in biotechnology, we experiment on targeting the specific genes in the candidate solution to improve its trait in differential evolution (DE). We propose a simple and efficient method, called GT-based DE (GTDE), to solve LSOPs. In the algorithm design, a simple GT-based modification is developed to perform on the best individual, comprising probabilistically targeting the location of bottleneck dimensions, constructing a homologous targeting vector, and inserting the targeting vector into the best individual. In this way, all the bottleneck dimensions of the best individual can be probabilistically targeted and modified to break the bottleneck and to provide global guidance for more optimal evolution. Note that the GT is only performed on the globally best individual and is just carried out as a simple operator that is added to the standard DE. Experimental studies compare the GTDE with some other state-of-the-art large-scale optimization algorithms, including the winners of CEC2010, CEC2012, CEC2013, and CEC2018 competitions on large-scale optimization. The results show that the GTDE is efficient and performs better than or at least comparable to the others in solving LSOPs.

AB fitness assignment process transforms the features (such as the objective value) of a candidate solution to a scalar fitness, which then is the basis for selection. Under frequency fitness assignment (FFA), the fitness corresponding to an objective value is its encounter frequency in selection steps and is subject to minimization. FFA creates algorithms that are not biased toward better solutions and are invariant under all injective transformations of the objective function value. We investigate the impact of FFA on the performance of two theory inspired, state-of-theart evolutionary algorithms, the Greedy (2 + 1) GA and the self-adjusting (1 + (?, ?)) GA. FFA improves their performance significantly on some problems that are hard for them. In our experiments, one FFA-based algorithm exhibited mean runtimes that appear to be polynomial on the theory-based benchmark problems in our study, including traps, jumps, and plateaus. We propose two hybrid approaches that use both direct and FFA-based optimization and find that they perform well. All FFAbased algorithms also perform better on satisfiability problems than any of the pure algorithm variants.

TI Domination-Based Selection and Shift-Based Density Estimation for

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; HANDLING METHOD; CONSTRUCTION
AB Balancing constraints and objective functions in constrained evolutionary multiobjective optimization is not an easy task. Overemphasis on constraints satisfaction may easily lead to the search to get stuck in local optimal regions, and overemphasis on objectives optimization may lead to substantial search resources wasted on infeasible regions. This article proposes a constrained multiobjective optimization algorithm, called CMOEA-SDE, aiming to achieve a good balance between the above two issues. To do so, CMOEA-SDE presents a strictly constrained dominance relation and a constrained shift-based density estimation strategy. Specifically, the former defines a new dominance relation that considers both constraint satisfaction and the objective functions. It favors good feasible solutions but still leaves room for infeasible solutions to be selected. Unlike most density estimation methods, which only consider the diversity of solutions, our shift-based density estimator covers both the feasibility and the diversity of solutions. That is, our estimator shifts the solutions' positions based on the extent of the constraints they violate so that solutions violating constraints more severely are shifted to crowded areas, thus being eliminated early. Systematic experiments were conducted on four benchmark test suites and six real-world constrained multiobjective optimization problems. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve very competitive performance against state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.

DE Index Terms-Evolutionary algorithm; gender; gene expression programming
AB Evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used for numerous optimization problems with great success in the past years. They mimic nature's process of evolution to find solutions to a large range of mathematical problems. In this work a new strategy is suggested to introduce gender, defined by a characteristic of an individual, that is easy to implement in evolutionary algorithms, as long as they are based on evaluating a fitness function. The new method outperforms comparable evolutionary approaches without gender for all standard test problems considered. The present study shows that with increasing problem complexity the performance of this gender variant increases to more than double the success rates while keeping the computational effort at about the same level and still being clearly better for easy problems. Additionally, in the mean, the new method results in better fitness values for all presented cases.

ID EVOLUTIONARY MULTITASKING; ALGORITHM
AB Multitask optimization aims to solve multiple optimization problems in parallel utilizing a single population. However, if the computing resources are limited, allocating the same computing resources to different tasks will cause resource waste and make complex tasks difficult to converge to the optimal solution. To address this issue, a multitask particle swarm optimization with a dynamic on-demand allocation strategy (MTPSO-DA) is proposed to dynamically allocate computing resources. First, a task complexity index, based on convergence rate and contribution rate, is designed to evaluate the difficulty of solving different tasks. Then, the complexity of different tasks can be evaluated in real time. Second, the skill factor of the particle is extended to a time-varying matrix according to the task complexity index. Then, the recently captured feedback is stored to determine the computational resource demands of the task. Third, an on-demand allocation strategy, based on the time-varying matrix, is developed to obtain the skill factor probability vector utilizing the attenuation accumulation method. Then, computing resources can be allocated dynamically among different tasks. Finally, some comparative experiments are conducted based on the benchmark problem to evaluate the superiority of the MTPSO-DA algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed MTPSO-DA algorithm can achieve dynamic resource allocation.

AB A variable reduction strategy (VRS) is an effective method to accelerate the optimization process of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) by simplifying the corresponding optimization problems. Unfortunately, the VRS is manually realized in a trial-and-error manner currently. To boost the efficiency of VRS and enable a more extensive application, we propose a variable reduction optimization problem (VROP) to represent a decision space with the smallest sets of variables. Thereafter, a heuristic rule-based automatic variable reduction algorithm (AVRA) is designed to address the VROP. AVRA sequentially reduces variables by considering several sophisticated designed heuristic rules, which search for a variable that can be utilized to represent as many variables as possible and that can be represented by the smallest set of variables possible. With AVRA, the decision variables of an optimization problem can be automatically grouped into reduced variables and core variables, where core variables can represent reduced variables and the entire decision space. During the optimization process, we only need to search the core variables to optimize the problem. Therefore, the dimensionality of the decision space can be reduced by AVRA, subsequently, simplifying the complexity of the problem and improving the search efficiency of EAs. To testify the effectiveness of AVRA, we blend AVRA with several promising EAs to solve two types of challenging problems: 1) continuous equality-constrained optimization problems and 2) nonlinear equations systems. Extensive experiments verify that an EA with AVRA outperforms the standard EA.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Evolutionary multitasking (EMT) is one of the emerging topics in evolutionary computation. EMT can solve multiple related optimization tasks simultaneously and enhance the optimization of each task via knowledge sharing among tasks. Many EMT algorithms have been proposed and achieved success in various problems, yet EMT for multiobjective optimization remains a big challenge. The existing multiobjective EMT algorithms tend to suffer from slow convergence and difficulty in generating high-quality knowledge. To alleviate these issues, this article proposes a new EMT algorithm, namely, EMT-GS for multiobjective optimization based on two generative strategies. Particularly, generative adversarial networks (GANs) and inertial differential evolution (IDE) are introduced to generate transferable knowledge and offspring, respectively. A GAN is trained periodically for each source-target task pair, based on which helpful knowledge is generated from the source task and transferred to boost the solving of the target task. To accelerate the population convergence, the IDE strategy is put forward to generate offspring in a promising direction according to the individuals from the previous generation and the transferred knowledge. The performance of EMT-GS is validated on three multitasking multiobjective benchmark problems. The experimental results highlight the excellent competitiveness of EMT-GS compared to other state-of-the-art multiobjective EMT algorithms.

AB Human intelligence can simultaneously process many tasks with the ability to accumulate and reuse knowledge. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, such as transfer, multitask, and layered learning, seek to replicate these abilities. However, humans must specify the task order, which is often difficult particularly with uncertain domain knowledge. This work introduces a continual-learning system (ConCS), such that given an open-ended set of problems once each is solved its solution can contribute to solving further problems. The hypothesis is that the evolutionary computation approach of learning classifier systems (LCSs) can form this system due to its niched, cooperative rules. A collaboration of parallel LCSs identifies sets of patterns linking features to classes that can be reused in related problems automatically. Results from distinct Boolean and integer classification problems, with varying interrelations, show that by combining knowledge from simple problems, complex problems can be solved at increasing scales. 100% accuracy is achieved for the problems tested regardless of the order of task presentation. This includes intractable problems for previous approaches, e.g., n -bit Majority-on. A major contribution is that human guidance is now unnecessary to determine the task learning order. Furthermore, the system automatically generates the curricula for learning the most difficult tasks.

AB Metaheuristic algorithms have been investigated intensively to address highly complex combinatorial optimization problems. However, most metaheuristic algorithms have been designed manually by researchers of different expertise without a consistent framework. This article proposes a general search framework (GSF) to formulate in a unified way a range of different metaheuristics. With generic algorithmic components, including selection heuristics and evolution operators, the unified GSF aims to serve as the basis of analyzing algorithmic components for automated algorithm design. With the established new GSF, two reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods, deep Q-network based and proximal policy optimization-based methods, have been developed to automatically design a new general population-based algorithm. The proposed RL-based methods are able to intelligently select and combine appropriate algorithmic components during different stages of the optimization process. The effectiveness and generalization of the proposed RL-based methods are validated comprehensively across different benchmark instances of the capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows. This study contributes to making a key step toward automated algorithm design with a general framework supporting fundamental analysis by effective machine learning.

AB In surrogate-assisted multi-/many-objective evolutionary optimization, each solution normally has an approximated value on each objective, resulting in increased difficulties in selecting solutions for expensive objective evaluations due to complicated tradeoff between different objectives and accumulated uncertainty in the approximation of the objective functions. Thus, it is highly challenging to design an efficient model management strategy for surrogate-assisted expensive multi-/many-objective optimization. In this article, a surrogate model is built for each objective function, based on which a set of promising candidate solutions are found. Additionally, a Gaussian process model is constructed to approximate a newly designed performance indicator measuring both convergence and diversity properties of individual solutions. Finally, the solution of the found candidate solutions having the maximum expected improvement in terms of the performance indicator is selected for evaluation using the expensive objective functions. Comparative experiments are conducted on 3-, 5-, and 10-objective DTLZ, WFG, and MaF test functions, as well as two real-world applications. The experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive compared to five state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms for expensive multi-/many-objective optimization.

AB We have recently proposed a framework of in vivo computation (IVC) which transforms the early tumor sensing problem into a computational problem. In the framework, a tumor-triggered biological gradient field (BGF) guides the swarm-intelligence-assisted targeting process, where externally manipulable and trackable magnetic nanorobots act as computational agents for the optimization procedure. As BGF can be viewed as an objective function which is utilized to define the fitness landscape for the agents, the inherent attributes of BGF are critical to the IVC process. All our previous investigations are based on the hypothesis that the BGF landscape remains time invariant during the tumor-targeting process, which results in a static function optimization problem. However, the properties of internal environment, such as the flow state of body fluid, will naturally lead to time-dependent variation of BGF, which means that the targeting process should be modeled as a dynamic function optimization problem. Based on this consideration, we focus on dynamic IVC by considering different variation patterns of BGF in this article. Two computational intelligence strategies named "swarm-based learning" and "individual-based learning" are proposed for dealing with the turbulence of the fitness estimation caused by the BGF variation. The in silico experiments and statistical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. In addition, the above process is conducted in a 3-D search space, where the tumor vascular network is generated by an invasion percolation algorithm, which is more realistic compared to the 2-D search space in our previous works.

AB This article proposes a novel differential evolution algorithm for solving constrained multimodal multiobjective optimization problems (CMMOPs), which may have multiple feasible Pareto-optimal solutions with identical objective vectors. In CMMOPs, due to the coexistence of multimodality and constraints, it is difficult for current algorithms to perform well in both objective and decision spaces. The proposed algorithm uses the speciation mechanism to induce niches preserving more feasible Pareto-optimal solutions and adopts an improved environment selection criterion to enhance diversity. The algorithm can not only obtain feasible solutions but also retain more well-distributed feasible Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, a set of constrained multimodal multiobjective test functions is developed. All these test functions have multimodal characteristics and contain multiple constraints. Meanwhile, this article proposes a new indicator, which comprehensively considers the feasibility, convergence, and diversity of a solution set. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing with the state-of-the-art algorithms on both test functions and real-world location-selection problem.

AB Unbalanced classification has attracted widespread interest because of its broad applications. However, due to mainly the uneven class distribution, constructed classifiers are usually biased toward the majority class, and thereby perform terribly on the minority class. Unfortunately, the minority class is often the class of interest in many real-world applications. High dimensionality often further degrades the classification performance, making it more complicated to address the class imbalance issue. Genetic programming (GP) has been applied to construct classifiers, which can simultaneously select good-quality features to improve the classification performance. To handle the class imbalance issue, cost-sensitive GP classifiers treat the minority class as being more important than the majority class, but this may cause an accuracy decrease in overlapping areas where the prior probabilities of the two classes are almost the same. To date, most cost-sensitive classification methods have not been specifically investigated how the impacts of overlapping areas on cost-sensitive classifiers can be avoided. In this study, we propose a new cost-sensitive GP method, where rough set theory is employed to detect overlapping areas before training cost-sensitive classifiers for classification with unbalanced high-dimensional data. The proposed method is compared with 46 popular classification methods, including 10 GP methods and 36 non-GP methods on 14 datasets that are unbalanced and high dimensional. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method performs better than the compared methods in almost all cases.

AB An unbounded external archive has been used to store all nondominated solutions found by an evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm in some studies. It has been shown that a selected solution subset from the stored solutions is often better than the final population. However, the use of the unbounded archive is not always realistic. When the number of examined solutions is huge, we must prespecify the archive size. In this study, we examine the effects of the archive size on three aspects: 1) the quality of the selected final solution set; 2) the total computation time for the archive maintenance and the final solution set selection; and 3) the required memory size. Unsurprisingly, the increase of the archive size improves the final solution set quality. Interestingly, the total computation time of a medium-size archive is much larger than that of a small-size archive and a huge-size archive (e.g., an unbounded archive). To decrease the computation time, we examine two ideas: 1) periodical archive update and 2) archiving only in later generations. Compared with updating the archive at every generation, the first idea can obtain almost the same final solution set quality using a much shorter computation time at the cost of a slight increase of the memory size. The second idea drastically decreases the computation time at the cost of a slight deterioration of the final solution set quality. Based on our experimental results, some suggestions are given about how to appropriately choose an archiving strategy and an archive size.

AB In this letter, we propose HV-Net, a new method for hypervolume approximation in evolutionary multiobjective optimization. The basic idea of HV-Net is to use DeepSets, a deep neural network with permutation invariant property, to approximate the hypervolume of a nondominated solution set. The input of HV-Net is a nondominated solution set in the objective space, and the output is an approximated hypervolume value of this solution set. The performance of HV-Net is evaluated through computational experiments by comparing it with two commonly used hypervolume approximation methods (i.e., point-based method and line-based method). Our experimental results show that HV-Net outperforms the other two methods in terms of both the approximation error and the runtime, which shows the potential of using deep learning techniques for hypervolume approximation.

AB In this article, we propose a Thompson sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior for unimodal bandit under Gaussian reward setting, where the expected reward is unimodal over the partially ordered arms. To exploit the unimodal structure better, at each step, instead of exploration from the entire decision space, the proposed algorithm makes decisions according to posterior distribution only in the arm's neighborhood with the highest empirical mean estimate. We theoretically prove that the asymptotic regret of our algorithm reaches O(log T), i.e., it shares the same regret order with asymptotic optimal algorithms, which is comparable to extensive existing state-ofthe-art unimodal multiarm bandit (U-MAB) algorithms. Finally, we use extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on both synthetic datasets and real-world applications.

DE Attribution; confidence scores; counterfactual explanations; deep
   learning; deliberative explanations; explainable AI
AB Attribution-based explanations are popular in computer vision but of limited use for fine-grained classification problems typical of expert domains, where classes differ by subtle details. In these domains, users also seek understanding of "why" a class was chosen and "why not" an alternative class. A new GenerAlized expLanatiOn fRamEwork (GALORE) is proposed to satisfy all these requirements, by unifying attributive explanations with explanations of two other types. The first is a new class of explanations, denoted deliberative, proposed to address the "why" question, by exposing the network insecurities about a prediction. The second is the class of counterfactual explanations, which have been shown to address the "why not" question but are now more efficiently computed. GALORE unifies these explanations by defining them as combinations of attribution maps with respect to various classifier predictions and a confidence score. An evaluation protocol that leverages object recognition (CUB200) and scene classification (ADE20 K) datasets combining part and attribute annotations is also proposed. Experiments show that confidence scores can improve explanation accuracy, deliberative explanations provide insight into the network deliberation process, the latter correlates with that performed by humans, and counterfactual explanations enhance the performance of human students in machine teaching experiments.

AB The rapid development of deep learning has made a great progress in image segmentation, one of the fundamental tasks of computer vision. However, the current segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of pixel-level annotations, which are often expensive, tedious, and laborious. To alleviate this burden, the past years have witnessed an increasing attention in building label-efficient, deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms. This paper offers a comprehensive review on label-efficient image segmentation methods. To this end, we first develop a taxonomy to organize these methods according to the supervision provided by different types of weak labels (including no supervision, inexact supervision, incomplete supervision and inaccurate supervision) and supplemented by the types of segmentation problems (including semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and panoptic segmentation). Next, we summarize the existing label-efficient image segmentation methods from a unified perspective that discusses an important question: how to bridge the gap between weak supervision and dense prediction - the current methods are mostly based on heuristic priors, such as cross-pixel similarity, cross-label constraint, cross-view consistency, and cross-image relation. Finally, we share our opinions about the future research directions for label-efficient deep image segmentation.

TI Adaptive Feature Selection With Augmented Attributes
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Augmented attributes; feature selection; l(0)-norm; reusability
ID REPRESENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; SCALE
AB In many dynamic environment applications, with the evolution of data collection ways, the data attributes are incremental and the samples are stored with accumulated feature spaces gradually. For instance, in the neuroimaging-based diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders, with emerging of diverse testing ways, we get more brain image features over time. The accumulation of different types of features will unavoidably bring difficulties in manipulating the high-dimensional data. It is challenging to design an algorithm to select valuable features in this feature incremental scenario. To address this important but rarely studied problem, we propose a novel Adaptive Feature Selection method (AFS). It enables the reusability of the feature selectionmodel trained on previous features and adapts it to fit the feature selection requirements on all features automatically. Besides, an ideal l(0)-norm sparse constraint for feature selection is imposed with a proposed effective solving strategy. We present the theoretical analyses about the generalization bound and convergence behavior. After tackling this problem in a one-shot case, we extend it to the multi-shot scenario. Plenty of experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of reusing previous features and the superior of l(0)-norm constraint in various aspects, together with its effectiveness in discriminating schizophrenic patients from healthy controls.

TI Adaptive Search-and-Training for Robust and Efficient Network Pruning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Knowledge distillation; model compression; network pruning
AB Both network pruning and neural architecture search (NAS) can be interpreted as techniques to automate the design and optimization of artificial neural networks. In this paper, we challenge the conventional wisdom of training before pruning by proposing a joint search-and-training approach to learn a compact network directly from scratch. Using pruning as a search strategy, we advocate three new insights for network engineering: 1) to formulate adaptive search as a cold start strategy to find a compact subnetwork on the coarse scale; and 2) to automatically learn the threshold for network pruning; 3) to offer flexibility to choose between efficiency and robustness. More specifically, we propose an adaptive search algorithm in the cold start by exploiting the randomness and flexibility of filter pruning. The weights associated with the network filters will be updated by ThreshNet, a flexible coarse-to-fine pruning method inspired by reinforcement learning. In addition, we introduce a robust pruning strategy leveraging the technique of knowledge distillation through a teacher-student network. Extensive experiments on ResNet and VGGNet have shown that our proposed method can achieve a better balance in terms of efficiency and accuracy and notable advantages over current state-of-the-art pruning methods in several popular datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

TI ADPL: Adaptive Dual Path Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic
   Segmentation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Domain adaptation; semantic segmentation; image translation;
   self-supervised learning
AB To alleviate the need for large-scale pixel-wise annotations, domain adaptation for semantic segmentation trains segmentation models on synthetic data (source) with computer-generated annotations, which can be then generalized to segment realistic images (target). Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with image translation to well align a single domain (source or target). However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In addition, pseudo labels generated by a single segmentation model aligned in either the source or target domain may be not accurate enough for SSL. In this paper, based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the source and target domain are almost complementary, we propose a novel adaptive dual path learning (ADPL) framework to alleviate visual inconsistency and promote pseudo-labeling by introducing two interactive single-domain adaptation paths aligned in source and target domain respectively. To fully explore the potential of this dual-path design, novel technologies such as dual path image translation (DPIT), dual path adaptive segmentation (DPAS), dual path pseudo label generation (DPPLG) and Adaptive ClassMix are proposed. The inference of ADPL is extremely simple, only one segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Our ADPL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins on GTA5 -> Cityscapes, SYNTHIA -> Cityscapes and GTA5 -> BDD100K scenarios. Code and models are available at https:// github.com/royee182/DPL.

AB Low-rank self-representation based subspace learning has confirmed its great effectiveness in a broad range of applications. Nevertheless, existing studies mainly focus on exploring the global linear subspace structure, and cannot commendably handle the case where the samples approximately (i.e., the samples contain data errors) lie in several more general affine subspaces. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we innovatively propose to introduce affine and nonnegative constraints into low-rank self-representation learning. While simple enough, we provide their underlying theoretical insight from a geometric perspective. The union of two constraints geometrically restricts each sample to be expressed as a convex combination of other samples in the same subspace. In this way, when exploring the global affine subspace structure, we can also consider the specific local distribution of data in each subspace. To comprehensively demonstrate the benefits of introducing two constraints, we instantiate three low-rank self-representation methods ranging from single-view low-rank matrix learning to multi-view low-rank tensor learning. We carefully design the solution algorithms to efficiently optimize the proposed three approaches. Extensive experiments are conducted on three typical tasks, including single-view subspace clustering, multi-view subspace clustering, and multi-view semi-supervised classification. The notably superior experimental results powerfully verify the effectiveness of our proposals.
