AB This paper focuses on the topic of fault-tolerant control for discrete-time systems with nonlinear uncertainties and actuator faults. It considers both passive and active faults as part of the analysis and design. The proposed adaptive controller, based on a nonlinear electronic circuit, handles offset-biasing, sensitivity variation, and dead-zone effects. An event-triggered mechanism, utilizing a sliding surface, enhances robustness and reduces data transmission. Adaptive networks called MiFRENs are employed, trained using reinforcement learning. Theoretical analysis guarantees boundedness of internal signals and tracking error. Experimental results validate the scheme, demonstrating required conditions, reduced data transmission, and robust performance.

TI Neural networks with divisive normalization for image segmentation

   normalization; Image segmentation; Cityscapes dataset
AB One of the key problems in computer vision is adaptation: models are too rigid to follow the variability of the inputs. The canonical computation that explains adaptation in sensory neuroscience is divisive normalization, and it has appealing effects on image manifolds. In this work we show that including divisive normalization in current deep networks makes them more invariant to non-informative changes in the images. In particular, we illustrate this concept in U-Net architectures for image segmentation. Experiments show that the inclusion of divisive normalization in the U-Net architecture leads to better segmentation results with respect to the conventional U-Net. The gain increases steadily when dealing with images acquired in bad weather conditions (from 3% of IoU increase in regular weather up to 20% on high fog). In addition to the positive results on the Cityscapes and Foggy Cityscapes datasets, we explain these advantages through the visualization of the responses: the equalization induced by the divisive normalization leads to more invariant features to local changes in contrast and illumination.

DT Article
ID AGE; CHILDREN; INFANTS
AB Purpose: To predict the corresponding age of myelin maturation from brain MRI scans in infants and young children by using a deep learning algorithm and to build upon previously published models. Materials and Methods: Brain MRI scans acquired between January 1, 2011, and March 17, 2021, in our institution in patients aged 0-3 years were retrospectively retrieved from the archive. An ensemble of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network models was trained and internally validated in 710 patients to predict myelin maturation age on the basis of radiologist-generated labels. The model ensemble was tested on an internal dataset of 123 patients and two external datasets of 226 (0-25 months of age) and 383 (0-2 months of age) healthy children and infants, respectively. Mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to assess model performance. Results: The 2D, 3D, and 2D-plus-3D ensemble models showed MAE values of 1.43, 2.55, and 1.77 months, respectively, on the internal test set, values of 2.26, 2.27, and 1.22 months on the first external test set, and values of 0.44, 0.27, and 0.31 months on the second external test set. The ensemble model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model on the same external test set (MAE = 1.22 vs 2.09 months).Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model accurately predicted myelin maturation age using pediatric brain MRI scans and may help reduce the time needed to complete this task, as well as interobserver variability in radiologist predictions.

AB Purpose: To present a deep learning segmentation model that can automatically and robustly segment all major anatomic structures on body CT images. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 1204 CT examinations (from 2012, 2016, and 2020) were used to segment 104 anatomic structures (27 organs, 59 bones, 10 muscles, and eight vessels) relevant for use cases such as organ volumetry, disease characterization, and surgical or radiation therapy planning. The CT images were randomly sampled from routine clinical studies and thus represent a real-world dataset (different ages, abnormalities, scanners, body parts, sequences, and sites). The authors trained an nnUNet segmentation algorithm on this dataset and calculated Dice similarity coefficients to evaluate the model's performance. The trained algorithm was applied to a second dataset of 4004 whole-body CT examinations to investigate age-dependent volume and attenuation changes. Results: The proposed model showed a high Dice score (0.943) on the test set, which included a wide range of clinical data with major abnormalities. The model significantly outperformed another publicly available segmentation model on a separate dataset (Dice score, 0.932 vs 0.871; P <.001). The aging study demonstrated significant correlations between age and volume and mean attenuation for a variety of organ groups (eg, age and aortic volume [r s = 0.64; P <.001]; age and mean attenuation of the autochthonous dorsal musculature [r s = -0.74; P <.001]). Conclusion: The developed model enables robust and accurate segmentation of 104 anatomic structures. The annotated dataset (https:// doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613) and toolkit (https://www.github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator) are publicly available.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning (DL) model for breast US across four hospitals and assess its value to readers with different levels of experience. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a dual attention-based convolutional neural network was built and validated to discriminate malignant tumors from benign tumors by using B-mode and color Doppler US images (n = 45909, March 2011-August 2018), acquired with 42 types of US machines, of 9895 pathologic analysis-confirmed breast lesions in 8797 patients (27 men and 8770 women; mean age, 47 years +/- 12 [SD]). With and without assistance from the DL model, three novice readers with less than 5 years of US experience and two experienced readers with 8 and 18 years of US experience, respectively, interpreted 1024 randomly selected lesions. Differences in the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were tested using the DeLong test. Results: The DL model using both B-mode and color Doppler US images demonstrated expert-level performance at the lesion level, with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.95) for the internal set. In external datasets, the AUCs were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90, 0.94) for hospital 1, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.94) for hospital 2, and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94, 0.98) for hospital 3. DL assistance led to improved AUCs (P <.001) for one experienced and three novice radiologists and improved interobserver agreement. The average false-positive rate was reduced by 7.6% (P =.08). Conclusion: The DL model may help radiologists, especially novice readers, improve accuracy and interobserver agreement of breast tumor diagnosis using US.

ID MODELS; PERFORMANCE; UNCERTAINTY; FRAMEWORK
AB Decision tree (DT) models provide a transparent approach to prediction of patient's outcomes within a probabilistic framework. Averaging over DT models under certain conditions can deliver reliable estimates of predictive posterior probability distributions, which is of critical importance in the case of predicting an individual patient's outcome. Reliable estimations of the distribution can be achieved within the Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and its Reversible Jump extension enabling DT models to grow to a reasonable size. Existing MCMC strategies however have limited ability to control DT structures and tend to sample overgrown DT models, making unreasonably small partitions, thus deteriorating the uncertainty calibration. This happens because the MCMC explores a DT model parameter space within a limited knowledge of the distribution of data partitions. We propose a new adaptive strategy which overcomes this limitation, and show that in the case of predicting trauma outcomes the number of data partitions can be significantly reduced, so that the unnecessary uncertainty of estimating the predictive posterior density is avoided. The proposed and existing strategies are compared in terms of entropy which, being calculated for predicted posterior distributions, represents the uncertainty in decisions. In this framework, the proposed method has outperformed the existing sampling strategies, so that the unnecessary uncertainty in decisions is efficiently avoided.

ID GENERALIZATION BOUNDS; RANKING
AB Pairwise learning is an important machine-learning topic with many practical applications. An online algorithm is the first choice for processing streaming data and is preferred for handling large-scale pairwise learning problems. However, existing online pairwise learning algorithms are not scalable and efficient enough for large-scale high-dimensional data, because they were designed based on singly stochastic gradients. To address this challenging problem, in this article, we propose a dynamic doubly stochastic gradient algorithm (D2SG) for online pairwise learning. Especially, only the time and space complexities of O(d) are needed for incorporating a new sample, where d is the dimensionality of data. This means that our D2SG is much faster and more scalable than the existing online pairwise learning algorithms while the statistical accuracy can be guaranteed through our rigorous theoretical analysis under standard assumptions. The experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets not only confirm the theoretical result of our new D2SG algorithm, but also show that D2SG has better efficiency and scalability than the existing online pairwise learning algorithms.

AB The existing solutions for nonconvex optimization problems show satisfactory performance in noise-free scenarios. However, they are prone to yield inaccurate results in the presence of noise in real-world problems, which may lead to failures in optimizing nonconvex problems. To this end, in this article, we propose a coevolutionary neural solution (CNS) by combining a simplified neurodynamics (SND) model with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Specifically, the proposed SND model does not leverage the time-derivative information, exhibiting greater stability compared to existing models. Furthermore, due to the noise tolerance capacity and rapid convergence property exhibited by the SND model, the CNS can rapidly achieve the optimal solution even in the presence of various perturbations. Theoretical analyses ensure that the proposed CNS is globally convergent with robustness and probability. In addition, the effectiveness of the CNS is compared with those of the existing solutions by a class of illustrative examples. We further apply the proposed solution to design a finite impulse response (FIR) filter and a pressure vessel to demonstrate its performance.

AB Graph clustering based on graph contrastive learning (GCL) is one of the dominant paradigms in the current graph clustering research field. However, those GCL-based methods often yield false negative samples, which can distort the learned representations and limit clustering performance. In order to alleviate this issue, we propose the idea of maintaining mutual information (MI) between the representations and the inputs to mitigate the loss of semantic information of false negative samples. We demonstrate the validity of this proposal through relevant experiments. Since maximizing MI can be approximately replaced by minimizing reconstruction error, we further propose a graph clustering method based on GCL penalized by reconstruction error, in which our carefully designed reconstruction decoder, as well as reconstruction error term, improve the clustering performance. In addition, we use a pseudo-label-guided strategy to improve the GCL process and further alleviate the problem of false negative samples. Our experiment results demonstrate the superiority and great potential of our proposed graph clustering method compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Aiming at the problems of low localization accuracy and poor mapping consistency for mobile robots in dynamic environments, this paper presents a 3D simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm based on RGB-D (Red Green Blue and Depth) image with semantic features. In the front-end, semantic segmentation is performed using Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network), also, combining the depth and distance information of feature points with random sampling to obtain static feature points with higher confidence. Then, the relative static point is obtained by matching the dynamic feature points of the adjacent frames, which is added to the tracking and optimization of the current frame to obtain the minimized re-projection error and the optimal pose of robot. In order to adapt the uncertainty of dynamic feature point changes, a high-performance keyframe selection method is developed for different situations. In the back-end, a closed loop detection strategy is constructed by combining semantic information with bag-of-words (BOW) model. Further, according to whether a closed loop is formed or not, a combinatorial optimization strategy based on graph optimization and factor graph optimization is adopted to improve the real time performance of the algorithm. Finally, these images with semantic tags obtained after semantic cutting are employed to build a semantic octree map of the environment. A series of simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.

AB Real-time manipulability maximization is a common sub-task for the a redundant manipulator. However, due to the heavy computational burden and non-convex characteristic of the manipulability function, most existing methods only locally maximize manipulability in redundancy under real-time conditions. To address this problem, we propose a real-time compatible method that achieves globally maximizes manipulability in redundancy, while simultaneously tracking the end-effector's pose. Our method is particularly applicable to a 7-degrees of freedom (DOFs) anthropomorphic manipulator, where its joint exhibits monotonicity. Utilizing the joint monotonicity, we initially propose an algorithm capable of computing redundancy resolution for global maximum manipulability in real-time. Subsequently, the task of optimizing manipulability in redundancy is transformed into tracking the redundancy joint with maximum manipulability. The redundancy joint tracking task is then integrated into an optimization-based controller. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in simulation and experiment.

AB Selecting suitable kinematic configurations for autonomous, flexible mobile systems remains a prominent challenge in various applications of trajectory tracking, including path solver planning, redundant robot control, grasping, and robotic system design. Current techniques based on the inverse kinematic problem suggest that the classic manipulability index referencing the local frame's velocity is sufficient to infer the behavior of the kinematic constraints. Successful constraint inference then allows the control strategy to be updated when the performance becomes suboptimal with respect to the target path. However, these approaches become deficient when the joint space is flexible, making it necessary to explicitly account for the structural parameters of the mobile system (e.g., number of joints, mass, wheel size, and links) in order to infer the behavior of the kinematic constraints. Instead, the dynamic confined space of velocities (DCSV), initially proposed by the author, suggests a Markovian process relating the local frame's velocity, kinematic constraint violations, and implicit flexibility. Hence, the present paper analyzes the DCSV's behavior and proposes an offline method to reconfigure the structural parameters, thus demonstrating how the DCSV's behavior can be used to reduce the violation of kinematic constraints. To this end, two lemmas and one theorem provide a new viewpoint regarding manipulability by using invariant and ergodic measurement conditions corresponding to the kinematic constraint evolution to compose DCSV-based selection criteria. The results are based on tracking problems and path-planning solvers in which the manipulability of a kinematic configuration is improved by updating the configuration according to optimal paths.

AB The demands placed on computational resources by the simulation requirements of high energy physics experiments motivate the development of novel simulation tools. Machine learning based generative models offer a solution that is both fast and accurate. In this work we extend the Bounded Information Bottleneck Autoencoder (BIB-AE) architecture, designed for the simulation of particle showers in highly granular calorimeters, in two key directions. First, we generalise the model to a multi-parameter conditioning scenario, while retaining a high degree of physics fidelity. In a second step, we perform a detailed study of the effect of applying a state-of-the-art particle flow-based reconstruction procedure to the generated showers. We demonstrate that the performance of the model remains high after reconstruction. These results are an important step towards creating a more general simulation tool, where maintaining physics performance after reconstruction is the ultimate target.

AB MIRACL is a multilingual dataset for ad hoc retrieval across 18 languages that collectively encompass over three billion native speakers around the world. This resource is designed to support monolingual retrieval tasks, where the queries and the corpora are in the same language. In total, we have gathered over 726k high-quality relevance judgments for 78k queries over Wikipedia in these languages, where all annotations have been performed by native speakers hired by our team. MIRACL covers languages that are both typologically close as well as distant from 10 language families and 13 sub-families, associated with varying amounts of publicly available resources. Extensive automatic heuristic verification and manual assessments were performed during the annotation process to control data quality. In total, MIRACL represents an investment of around five person-years of human annotator effort. Our goal is to spur research on improving retrieval across a continuum of languages, thus enhancing information access capabilities for diverse populations around the world, particularly those that have traditionally been underserved. MIRACL is available at http://miracl.ai/.

ID IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION
AB Ultra supercritical power plant (USC) is a complex system associated with nonlinearity, uncertainties and multivariable couplings. Generally, it is difficult to build an accurate model to approximate the dynamic behavior of USC. This paper presents a novel composite weighted human learning optimization network (CWHLO) to tackle the above-mentioned problem. Firstly, by fully using of the statistic characteristic of the history operating data, K-means clustering algorithm is applied to partition the raw date, which extremely reduces the operating nonlinearity. Then, an improved real-coded human learning optimization (HLO) is adopted to built linear models in local regions. Different from conventional methods, the advantage of the proposed CWHLO is that the nonlinear model of the object is effectively replaced by a real-time dynamic linear model, which is more suitable for other control methods. Finally, the CWHLO model is compared with the traditional recursive least square method (RLS), and four other meta-heuristic algorithms, to show the advantages in approximating the dynamic behavior of USC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background of the study: Breast cancer is the most fatal disease that widely affects women. When the cancerous lumps grow from the cells of the breast, it causes breast cancer. Self-analysis and regular medical check-ups help for detecting the disease earlier and enhance the survival rate. Hence, an automated breast cancer detection system in mammograms can assist clinicians in the patient's treatment. In medical techniques, the categorization of breast cancer becomes challenging for investigators and researchers. The advancement in deep learning ap-proaches has established more attention to their advantages to medical imaging issues, especially for breast cancer detection.Aim: The research work plans to develop a novel hybrid model for breast cancer diagnosis with the support of optimized deep-learning architecture.Methods: The required images are gathered from the benchmark datasets. These collected datasets are used in three pre-processing approaches like "Median Filtering, Histogram Equalization, and morphological operation", which helps to remove unwanted regions from the images. Then, the pre-processed images are applied to the Optimized U-net-based tumor segmentation phase for obtaining accurate segmented results along with the optimization of certain parameters in U-Net by employing "Adapted-Black Widow Optimization (A-BWO)". Further, the detection is performed in two different ways that is given as model 1 and model 2. In model 1, the segmented tumors are used to extract the significant patterns with the help of the "Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Gradient pattern (LGP)". Further, these extracted patterns are utilized in the "Dual Model accessed Optimized Long Short-Term Memory (DM-OLSTM)" for performing breast cancer detection and the detected score 1 is obtained. In model 2, the same segmented tumors are given into the different variants of CNN, such as "VGG19, Resnet150, and Inception". The extracted deep features from three CNN-based approaches are fused to form a single set of deep features. These fused deep features are inserted into the developed DM-OLSTM for getting the detected score 2 for breast cancer diagnosis. In the final phase of the hybrid model, the score 1 and score 2 obtained from model 1 and model 2 are averaged to get the final detection output.Results: The accuracy and F1-score of the offered DM-OLSTM model are achieved at 96 % and 95 %.Conclusion: Experimental analysis proves that the recommended methodology achieves better performance by analyzing with the benchmark dataset. Hence, the designed model is helpful for detecting breast cancer in real-time applications.

AB Achieving real-time agility and adaptation with respect to changing requirements in existing IT infrastructure can pose a complex challenge. We describe a goal-oriented approach to manage this complexity. We argue that a goal-oriented perspective can form an effective basis for devising and deploying responses to changed requirements at runtime. We offer an extended vocabulary of goal types by presenting two novel conceptions: differential goals and integral goals, which we formalize in both linear-time and branching-time settings. We describe goal lifecycles and interactions and the extended notion of context for the representation of rapidly changing, complex operating environments. We then illustrate the working of the approach by presenting a detailed scenario of adaptation in a Kubernetes setting, in the face of a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.

AB Among several approaches to tackle the problem of energy consumption in modern computing systems, two solutions are currently investigated: one consists of artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on photonic technologies, the other is a different paradigm compared to ANNs and it is based on random networks of non-linear nanoscale junctions resulting from the assembling of nanoparticles or nanowires as substrates for neuromorphic computing. These networks show the presence of emergent complexity and collective phenomena in analogy with biological neural networks characterized by self-organization, redundancy, and non-linearity. Starting from this background, we propose and formalize a generalization of the perceptron model to describe a classification device based on a network of interacting units where the input weights are non-linearly dependent. We show that this model, called "receptron", provides substantial advantages compared to the perceptron as, for example, the solution of non-linearly separable Boolean functions with a single device. The receptron model is used as a starting point for the implementation of an all-optical device that exploits the non-linearity of optical speckle fields produced by a solid scatterer. By encoding these speckle fields we generated a large variety of target Boolean functions. We demonstrate that by properly setting the model parameters, different classes of functions with different multiplicity can be solved efficiently. The optical implementation of the receptron scheme opens the way for the fabrication of a completely new class of optical devices for neuromorphic data processing based on a very simple hardware.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID RECONSTRUCTION
AB The reconstruction based on RGB images of dressed human body lacks the shape information of the human body under clothing, while the naked 3D human body scanning will violate the user's privacy. To overcome these limitations, a new method, based on Swin transformer (Swin-T), for reconstructing 3D human body shape from human orthogonal mask image is proposed. Its core is to express the reconstruction problem as solving regression mapping function. A fast body shape type classification method based on the human front mask is proposed. The regression function is innovatively represented as a piecewise function, with the body shape of the human body as the segmentation criterion. A multi-channel Swin-T architecture is designed, which can not only extract features from front and side mask images, but also their mixed features to construct the regression mapping function. Different body types for different genders are predicted with separate regression function to help estimate an accurate human model. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method effectively achieves visually realistic and accurate body reconstruction, and significantly outperforms the current state-ofthe-art methods. In addition, the classification of body types can compensate for the errors caused by partial clothing laxity in practical applications, which is beneficial for users to obtain a more accurate 3D human model.

AB In this study, we present a road map from shared to full autonomy for human-in-the-loop mobile robot navigation systems. We proposed a shared autonomy framework that incorporates human-robot joint perception and action to enhance the practicality and applicability of the mobile robot navigability. Accuracy of robotic sensing and precision of robotic action are employed as autonomous safety in the loop of human control. In shared autonomy, autonomous safety is incorporated into human-teleoperated robot control and their integration is adjusted through an online user-customizable arbitration function. Beyond the current state of the art in shared autonomy, social skills and social preferences in terms of human perception, as well as cognitive decision-making and action, are compiled into autonomous behaviors through learning from demonstration method. Autonomous behaviors exported from the trained neural networks are integrated with autonomous safety and then adjusted by user-desired control arbitration for robot autonomy. The transition of shared and full autonomy is easily managed by users, depending on specific applications. To validate the methodological approach, we implemented the framework on two mobile robot platforms to evaluate its feasibility, practicability, and reproducibility. Our experimental results showed that the shared autonomy framework was well applied to incorporating personal skills and social preferences in mobile robot navigation systems. To a certain extent, the framework plays the role of the road map guiding how to take advantage of human cognitive perception and decision and precision of robotic action in developing mobile robot navigation systems that can be deployed and applied to real-world applications.

AB Soft robotic is revolutionizing conventional robotics due to its numerous advantages such as safer interaction and compliant behavior. They are becoming increasingly popular in the medical field due to their safe human-robot interactions. Soft actuators are the main components of a soft robot. In the present work, a soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) is designed for soft robotic applications. The designed SPA is developed with an in-built flexible sensing element for measuring its deflection. The in-built sensing element has been fabricated using a soft composite material made from three ingredients i.e., polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), carbon nanofibers (CNF), and an ionic liquid (IL). The developed sensor is a piezo-resistive type sensor that provides feedback control based on the change in bending angle corresponding to its changing resistance. The designed SPA with an in-built sensor (SPAIS) has been fabricated using 3D printing and casting techniques with a commercially available silicone rubber material, namely Ecoflex-OO50. Finally, the developed SPAIS has been used to develop a soft robotic gripper with three fingers of SPAIS for grasping and holding of delicate objects of different shapes and sizes.

AB Capsule Network is powerful at defining the positional relationship between features in deep neural networks for visual recognition tasks, but it is computationally expensive and not suitable for running on mobile devices. The bottleneck is in the computational complexity of the Dynamic Routing mechanism used between the capsules. On the other hand, XNOR-Net is fast and computationally efficient, though it suffers from low accuracy due to information loss in the binarization process. To address the computational burdens of the Dynamic Routing mechanism, this paper proposes new Fully Connected (FC) layers by xnorizing the linear projection outside or inside the Dynamic Routing within the CapsFC layer. Specifically, our proposed FC layers have two versions, XnODR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Outside Dynamic Routing) and XnIDR (Xnorize the Linear Projection Inside Dynamic Routing). To test the generalization of both XnODR and XnIDR, we insert them into two different networks, MobileNetV2 and ResNet-50. Our experiments on three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MultiMNIST validate their effectiveness. The results demonstrate that both XnODR and XnIDR help networks to have high accuracy with lower FLOPs and fewer parameters (e.g., 96.14% correctness with 2.99M parameters and 311.74M FLOPs on CIFAR-10).

AB Mapless navigation for mobile Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has attracted significantly rising attention in robotic and related research communities. Collision avoidance from dynamic obstacles in unstructured environments, such as pedestrians and other vehicles, is one of the key challenges for mapless navigation. This paper proposes a DRL algorithm based on heuristic correction learning for autonomous navigation of a UGV in mapless configuration. We use a 24-dimensional lidar sensor, and merge the target position information and the speed information of the UGV as the input of the reinforcement learning agent. The actions of the UGV are produced as the output of the agent. Our proposed algorithm has been trained and evaluated in both static and dynamic environments. The experimental result shows that our proposed algorithm can reach the target in less time with shorter distances under the premise of ensuring safety than other algorithms. Especially, the success rate of our proposed algorithm is 2.05 times higher than the second effective algorithm and the trajectory efficiency is improved by 24%\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$24\%$$\end{document} in the dynamic environment. Finally, our proposed algorithm is deployed on a real robot in the real-world environment to validate and evaluate the algorithm performance. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can be directly applied to real robots robustly.

AB Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood that often persists into adulthood. Objectively diagnosing ADHD can be challenging due to the reliance on subjective questionnaires in clinical assessment. Fortunately, recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have shown promise in providing objective diagnoses through the analysis of medical images or activity recordings. These AI-based techniques have demonstrated accurate ADHD diagnosis; however, the growing complexity of deep learning models has introduced a lack of interpretability. These models often function as black boxes, unable to offer meaningful insights into the data patterns that characterize ADHD. Objective: This paper proposes a methodology to interpret the output of an AI-based diagnosis system for combined ADHD in age and gender-stratified populations. Methods: Our system is based on the analysis of 24 hour-long activity records using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify spectrograms of activity windows. These windows are interpreted using occlusion maps to highlight the time-frequency patterns explaining ADHD activity. Results: Significant differences in the frequency patterns between ADHD and controls both in diurnal and nocturnal activity were found for all the populations. Temporal dispersion also presented differences in the male population. Conclusion: The proposed interpretation techniques for CNNs highlighted gender-and age-related differences between ADHD patients and controls. Leveraging these differences could potentially lead to improved diagnostic accuracy, especially if a larger and more balanced dataset is utilized. Significance: Our findings pave the way for the development of an AI-based diagnosis system for ADHD that offers interpretability, thereby providing valuable insights into the underlying etiology of the disease.

AB The impact of Artificial Intelligence in Legal Research has reached a high level in simulating human thought processes. Case Pendency is a long-lasting problem in many countries. The judicial system has to be more competent and reliable to provide justice on time for any developing country. Litigants and attorneys devote more time and effort to trial case preparation in the courtroom. The task of decision prediction is to automatically forecast the type of charge, law article, and term of punishment. Most of the earlier works for verdict prediction focused to work on civil law jurisdictions. Some of the challenges in the task are case facts are highly unstructured lengthy documents with a lack of annotations and mainly used machine learning techniques. While most research works ignore the information loss at the encoding stage, our proposed MHAN overcomes the above issue and long-range dependency problem using the attention model over hierarchical encoders with three tiers namely Sentence encoder, word encoder, and character encoder. To avoid information loss, a brand-new judgment prediction framework called MHAN is developed in this study effort. It is built on a modified Hierarchical-Attention network and a specially designed domain-specific word embedding model. Additionally, it emphasizes the feature extraction phase by joining features obtained using MHAN with an improved cosine similarity feature. Finally, a hybrid Self Improved RNN is employed to provide the projected results. Furthermore, the proposed model is trained on 10 types of real-time criminal cases from the Madras High Court of India and Supreme Court of India. It has outperformed prior methods in terms of verdict prediction. By applying different variations of the deep learning model and ablation tests, the proposed model achieves consistent results over baseline models.

AB The rise of sophisticated black-box machine learning models in Artificial Intelligence systems has prompted the need for explanation methods that reveal how these models work in an understandable way to users and decision makers. Unsurprisingly, the state-of-the-art exhibits currently a plethora of explainers providing many different types of explanations. With the aim of providing a compass for researchers and practitioners, this paper proposes a categorization of explanation methods from the perspective of the type of explanation they return, also considering the different input data formats. The paper accounts for the most representative explainers to date, also discussing similarities and discrepancies of returned explanations through their visual appearance. A companion website to the paper is provided as a continuous update to new explainers as they appear. Moreover, a subset of the most robust and widely adopted explainers, are benchmarked with respect to a repertoire of quantitative metrics.

DE Algorithmic fairness; Bias mitigation; Multi-objective optimization;
   Machine learning; Ensemble learning; Classification
AB One of the main challenges of machine learning is to ensure that its applications do not generate or propagate unfair discrimination based on sensitive characteristics such as gender, race, and ethnicity. Research in this area typically limits models to a level of discrimination quantified by an equity metric (usually the "benefit" discrepancy between privileged and non-privileged groups). However, when models reduce bias, they may also reduce their performance (e.g., accuracy, F1 score). Therefore, we have to optimize contradictory metrics (performance and fairness) at the same time. This problem is well characterized as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. In this study, we useMOOmethods to minimize the difference between groups, maximize the benefits for each group, and preserve performance. We search for the best trade-off models in binary classification problems and aggregate them using ensemble filtering and voting procedures. The aggregation of models with different levels of benefits for each group improves robustness regarding performance and fairness. We compared our approach with other known methodologies, using logistic regression as a benchmark for comparison. The proposed methods obtained interesting results: (i) multi-objective training found models that are similar to or better than the adversarial methods and are more diverse in terms of fairness and accuracy metrics, (ii) multi-objective selection was able to improve the balance between fairness and accuracy compared to selection with a single metric, and (iii) the final predictor found models with higher fairness without sacrificing much accuracy.

AB In this modern marketing and technological era, a strong strategy regarding digital marketing is crucial for the development of any organization. Digital marketing strategies are a collection of structured electronic-marketing aspects used by companies to fulfill marketing objectives and clients' needs. These strategies are necessary for electronic marketing managers and are the best way to increase profits and sales. The basic purpose of this paper is to explore best digital marketing strategies and how they affect client purchasing behavior at online retailers. Linguistic data gathered from clients are protected throughout the collection of data using a fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic (2TL) representation model and its integrated form with q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS), named a 2-tuple linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (2TLq-ROFS) is presented. Moreover, this paper goes a step further by extending the Hamacher operators to power aggregation operators, thereby presenting a comprehensive set of 2TLq-ROF power Hamacher aggregation operators. These advancements and methodologies enable a comprehensive analysis of client data while leveraging the power of fuzzy logic and linguistic modeling techniques, leading to valuable insights into the influence of digital marketing strategies on consumer behavior in the online retail sector. The main feature of the suggested operators is their ability to not only determine the correlations between any number of attributes and consider relationships between membership and non-membership degrees but also provide more general conclusions via a parameter. After defining the multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) approach, we implement the inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method for calculating the attribute weights. We also examine a novel strategy for dealing with MAGDM problems based on the presented operators. Last but not least, the suggested method is utilized in a real-world scenario involving the selection of the best digital marketing strategy to demonstrate their applicability and efficacy as well as the influence of parameters on the final results. The advantageous features and novelty of the presented methodology are further demonstrated by a detailed comparison with relevant approaches.

AB In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has become increasingly successful in its application to the quantum domain and the process of scientific discovery in general. However, while RL algorithms learn to solve increasingly complex problems, interpreting the solutions they provide becomes ever more challenging. In this work, we gain insights into an RL agent's learned behavior through a post-hoc analysis based on sequence mining and clustering. Specifically, frequent and compact subroutines, used by the agent to solve a given task, are distilled as gadgets and then grouped by various metrics. This process of gadget discovery develops in three stages: First, we use an RL agent to generate data, then, we employ a mining algorithm to extract gadgets and finally, the obtained gadgets are grouped by a density-based clustering algorithm. We demonstrate our method by applying it to two quantum-inspired RL environments. First, we consider simulated quantum optics experiments for the design of high-dimensional multipartite entangled states where the algorithm finds gadgets that correspond to modern interferometer setups. Second, we consider a circuit-based quantum computing environment where the algorithm discovers various gadgets for quantum information processing, such as quantum teleportation. This approach for analyzing the policy of a learned agent is agent and environment agnostic and can yield interesting insights into any agent's policy.

AB Text-to-image (T2I) generation, which involves synthesizing an image from a textual description, has emerged as a popular research topic in computer vision. Meanwhile, transformer-based models, such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5, have demonstrated promising results in various natural language processing tasks, including text generation and translation. However, their application to T2I generation remains largely unexplored. Therefore, a comparative study investigating the performance of BERT, GPT-2, and T5 in T2I generation is of significant importance. Such a study would shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each model, facilitating the identification of the most suitable approach for this task. In this paper, we propose three architectures to conduct a comparative study of T5, GPT-2, and BERT in T2I generation tasks. We fine-tune these models to generate text vectors and then transform the textual information into images using the affine transformation into the DF-GAN generator. Subsequently, we evaluate the quality, diversity, and the models' ability to recognize the words. Our experiments on the challenging CUB and Oxford-102 flower datasets demonstrate that T5 exhibits promising potential for T2I generation. It has the capability to generate visually appealing and semantically coherent images from textual descriptions.

Providing adequate and usable modeling tools is necessary to adopt modeling languages efficiently. Meta-modeling platforms provide a rich and mature set of functionalities for realizing state-of-the-art modeling tools. These tools, albeit their stability and rich set of features, often lack a modern look and feel considering (i) how they visualize the models, and (ii) how modelers interact with the models. Current web technologies enable much richer, advanced opportunities for visualizing and interacting with conceptual models. However, a structured and comprehensive overview of possible information visualization and interaction techniques linked to conceptual models and modeling tools must be established. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting an extended taxonomy of advanced information visualization and interaction in conceptual modeling. We present a generic taxonomy that is afterward contextualized within the specific domain of conceptual modeling. The taxonomy serves orientation in the vast developing field of information visualization and interaction and hopefully sparks innovation if future modeling tool development.

AB The diffusion of fake news is a growing problem with a high and negative social impact. There are several approaches to address the detection of fake news. This work focuses on a hybrid approach based on functional linguistic features and machine learning. There are several recent works with this approach. However, there are no clear guidelines on which linguistic features are most appropriate nor how to justify their use. Furthermore, many classification results are modest compared to recent advances in natural language processing. Our proposal considers 88 features organized in surface information, part of speech, discursive characteristics, and read-ability indices. On a 42 677 news database, we show that the classification results outperform previous work, even outperforming state-of-the-art techniques such as BERT, reaching 99.99% accuracy. A proper selection of linguistic features is crucial for interpretability as well as the performance of the models. In this sense, our proposal contributes to the intentional selection of linguistic features, overcoming current technical issues. We identified 32 features that show differences between the type of news. The results are highly competitive in the classification and simple to implement and interpret.

ID MATRIX FACTORIZATION
AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, commercial robots have gradually entered our daily lives. In order to promote product dissemination, shopping guide robots are a new service options of commerce platforms that use tag recommendation systems to identify users' intentions. A large number of applications combine user historical tagging information with the multi-round dialogue ability of shopping guide robots to help users efficiently search for and retrieve products of interest. Recently, tensor decomposition methods have become a common approach for modelling entity interaction relationships in tag recommendation systems. However, due to the sparsity of data, these methods only consider low-order information of entities, making it difficult to capture the higher-order collaborative signals among entities. Recommendation methods by autoencoders can effectively extract abstract feature representations while they only focus on the two-dimensional relationship between users and items, ignoring the interaction relationship among users, items and tags in real complex recommendation scenarios. The authors focus on modelling the similarity relationship among entities and propose a method called deep feature fusion tag (DFFT) based on the deep feature fusion of stacked denoising autoencoders. This method can extract high-order information with different embedding dimensions and fuse them in a unified framework. To extract robust feature representations, the authors inject random noise (mask-out/drop-out noise) into the tag information corresponding to users and items to generate corrupted input data, and then utilise autoencoders to encode the interaction relationship among entities. To further obtain the interaction relationship with different dimensions, different encoding layers are stacked and combined to produce a better expanded model which can reinforce each other. Finally, a decoding component is used to reconstruct the original input data. According to the experimental results on two common datasets, the proposed DFFT method outperforms other baselines in terms of the F1@N, NDCG@N and Recall@N evaluation metrics.

AB Recently, there have been significant advancements in the 3D face reconstruction field, largely driven by monocular image-based deep learning methods. However, these methods still face challenges in reliable deployments due to their sensitivity to facial occlusions and inability to maintain identity consistency across different occlusions within the same facial image. To address these issues, we propose two frameworks: Distillation Assisted Mono Image Occlusion Robustification (DAMIOR) and Duplicate Images Assisted Multi Occlusions Robustification (DIAMOR). The DAMIOR framework leverages the knowledge from the Occlusion Frail Trainer (OFT) network to enhance robustness against facial occlusions. Our proposed method overcomes the sensitivity to occlusions and improves reconstruction accuracy. To tackle the issue of identity inconsistency, the DIAMOR framework utilizes the estimates from DAMIOR to mitigate inconsistencies in geometry and texture, collectively known as identity, of the reconstructed 3D faces. We evaluate the performance of DAMIOR on two variations of the CelebA test dataset: empirical occlusions and irrational occlusions. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed DIAMOR framework using the irrational occlusion-based variant of the CelebA test dataset. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin. For example, DAMIOR reduces the 3D vertex-based shape error by 41.1% and the texture error by 21.8% for empirical occlusions. Besides, for facial data with irrational occlusions, DIAMOR achieves a substantial decrease in shape error by 42.5% and texture error by 30.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

AB In this paper, we present a novel algorithm - RGBMT* (Rapidly-exploring Generalized Bur Multi-Tree star), intended for asymptotically optimal motion planning for robotic manipulators in static environments. The main idea is the generation of local/extra trees rooted in random configurations, beside two main trees rooted in initial and goal configurations. Each local tree is expanded towards all other trees via bur of free configuration space (C-space). Each node is assigned a cost-to-come value, which is then used to optimally connect (if possible) all nodes from local trees to a single main tree according to Bellman's principle of optimality. The algorithm is provably asymptotically optimal, i.e., such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost-surely to the optimum. Main and local trees are aptly grown in order to prevent exploring C-space in regions which are unlikely to yield solutions. A comprehensive simulation study is performed analyzing runtimes and convergence rate, where RGBMT* is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Obtained results indicate some promising features of the proposed method.

ID FAST MARCHING TREE; MOTION; BENCHMARKING; ALGORITHM
AB Generating motions to grasp the objects in the scene is critical in robotic manipulation. The feasibility and quality of the output trajectory are closely related to both the grasping pose and the motion to reach the object, and decoupling grasp and motion planning cannot balance these two factors. In this paper, a motion planning method is proposed that comprehensively considers trajectory optimization, trajectory goal selection, and grasp adjustment. Trajectory optimization is formulated as an equality-constrained optimization problem, in which the end configuration of the trajectory can be changed during optimization. The update rule is derived and acts as a basic rule for goal selection and adjustment. The grasp configuration is chosen from a goal set, which helps the optimization to jump out of the local minima and generate smooth and feasible trajectories. We propose a two-stage grasp selection algorithm to balance between exploitation of the trajectory optimization and exploration of the goal set. To further optimize the trajectory, we propose a grasp adjustment method that allows the grasp pose to rotate about the connection line of the contact points in the workspace. To address this complicated problem, we divide the problem into two subproblems: computing the angle to rotate in the workspace and calculating the grasp configuration in the joint space. We design the overall planner and incorporate our method into a complete robotic arm platform with perception and the grasp generation network. All proposed methods are validated by performing comparative simulations and experiments.

AB The measurement of physical parameters of porous rock, which constitute reservoirs, is an essential part of hydrocarbon exploration. Typically, the measurement of these physical parameters is carried out through core analysis in a laboratory, which requires considerable time and high costs. Another approach involves using digital rock models, where the physical parameters are calculated through image processing and numerical simulations. However, this method also requires a significant amount of time for estimating the physical parameters of each rock sample. Machine learning, specifically convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, has been developed as an alternative method for estimating the physical parameters of porous rock in a shorter time frame. The advancement of CNN, particularly through transfer learning using pre-trained models, has contributed to rapid prediction capabilities. However, not all pre-trained models are suitable for estimating the physical parameters of porous rock. In this study, transfer learning was applied to estimate parameters of sandstones such as porosity, specific surface area, average grain size, average coordination number, and average throat radius. Six types of pre-trained models were utilized: ResNet152, DenseNet201, Xception, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and MobileNetV2. The results of this study indicate that the DenseNet201 model achieved the best performance with an error rate of 2.11%. Overall, this study highlights the potential of transfer learning to ultimately lead to more efficient and effective computation.

AB The infiltrative nature of malignant gliomas results in active tumor spreading into the peritumoral edema, which is not visible in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) even after contrast injection. MR relaxometry (qMRI) measures relaxation rates dependent on tissue properties and can offer additional contrast mechanisms to highlight the non-enhancing infiltrative tumor. To investigate if qMRI data provides additional information compared to cMRI sequences when considering deep learning-based brain tumor detection and segmentation, preoperative conventional (T1w per- and post-contrast, T2w and FLAIR) and quantitative (pre- and post-contrast R1, R2 and proton density) MR data was obtained from 23 patients with typical radiological findings suggestive of a high-grade glioma. 2D deep learning models were trained on transversal slices (n = 528) for tumor detection and segmentation using either cMRI or qMRI. Moreover, trends in quantitative R1 and R2 rates of regions identified as relevant for tumor detection by model explainability methods were qualitatively analyzed. Tumor detection and segmentation performance for models trained with a combination of qMRI pre- and post-contrast was the highest (detection Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) = 0.72, segmentation dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 0.90), however, the difference compared to cMRI was not statistically significant. Overall analysis of the relevant regions identified using model explainability showed no differences between models trained on cMRI or qMRI. When looking at the individual cases, relaxation rates of brain regions outside the annotation and identified as relevant for tumor detection exhibited changes after contrast injection similar to region inside the annotation in the majority of cases. In conclusion, models trained on qMRI data obtained similar detection and segmentation performance to those trained on cMRI data, with the advantage of quantitatively measuring brain tissue properties within a similar scan time. When considering individual patients, the analysis of relaxation rates of regions identified by model explainability suggests the presence of infiltrative tumor outside the cMRI-based tumor annotation.

AB In recent years, the new technologies of the Industry 4.0 have been considered by the academic and industrial community due to the increasing sustainability and future competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. However, manufacturers face many challenges when implementing Industry 4.0 that must be identified and analyzed. The present study seeks to identify and analyze the challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 in the glass industry in Iran. Based on a systematic review of the literature, a total of 23 challenges were identified in 6 dimensions. In the next step, using the Fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP technique and a survey of 10 experts, causal relationships between challenges were identified and prioritized. Findings showed that financial challenges are the most critical cause, and organizational-managerial challenges are the most critical effect in implementing new technologies in Industry 4.0. Also, human-cultural challenges interact more with other challenges. Finally, the results showed the challenges of cyber security issues, lack of regulatory, legal and contractual mechanisms, lack of standards, laws and regulations and a general framework in the field of digital and lack of budget and financial instruments for education, R & D and digital operations, the most important challenges in the implementation of new technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in polluting industries such as the glass industry. This study, for the first time, identifies and analyzes the challenges of implementing Industry 4.0 in one of Iran's polluting industries. The results of this study help policymakers to develop strategies for the acceptance and implementation of Industry 4.0.

AB Crop diseases can have a detrimental impact on crop growth, resulting in a significant reduction in crop yield. Therefore, accurate detection of these diseases is crucial for enhancing crop productivity. Despite notable advancements in deep learning techniques for disease identification, most experiments have been conducted under simplified laboratory conditions, posing challenges for accurately identifying crop diseases in complex real-world field environments. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the Transformer model's ability to capture long-range global dependencies and handle occlusion. We propose a novel approach called Dense CNNs and Transformer Network (DCTN) for accurate detection of field crop diseases. Moreover, we introduce a new attention mechanism that utilizes multi-head self-attention via deep separable convolution projection and down-sampling, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Additionally, we have meticulously curated and cleaned a dataset of 45,547 images depicting healthy and diseased crops in real-field environments. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of its robustness against background interference in crop disease detection. Notably, DCTN achieves accuracies of 93.01% and 99.69% on our dataset and a publicly available dataset, respectively. For those who are interested, the code for our approach will be made available on https://github.com/wh9704/DCTN.

ID STEGANALYSIS
AB Performance measurements which characterize digital image steganography techniques include payload capacity, stego image quality, and security (secret message detectability). Increasing payload capacity leads to diminishing both stego image quality and security. Conversely, a high stego image quality and a high security cannot be obtained without compromising payload capacity. It has become essential but increasingly challenging to achieve a balance between these image steganography requirements. The direction of recent contributions in the area of image steganography can be classified into two different approaches. The first approach is the development of techniques based on embedding efficiency in which the secret message hides while minimizing the embedding distortion in the cover image. The second approach is the development of techniques based on distortion function related to statistical detectability in which the secret message conceals in certain parts of the cover image determined by the defined distortion function such as textured or noisy regions. This study aims to provide the insight for the researchers about future works and pave away for them to design efficient steganography techniques. It practically analyzes and investigates which of the two approaches can attain all the requirements of image steganography simultaneously. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on a large-scale benchmark dataset which demonstrate that increasing the embedding efficiency reflects on increasing stego image quality as well as security without compromising payload capacity. The experimental findings reveal that the virtual designed steganography technique, LSB_EE_20, achieved the optimum results, with an embedding efficiency of 20, a PRNR of 62, and a message detectability of 0.11%. Consequently, this paper recommends that the researchers in this area concentrate on developing embedding techniques in which the embedding efficiency increases rather than focusing on distortion function.

AB Travel time estimation or prediction is of great significance to intelligent transportation systems. Apparently, many factors have a significant impact on travel time in the traffic trip. Combined estimation or prediction models for travel time can deal with many influence factors and effectively ameliorate the estimation or prediction accuracy, but uncertainty and fuzziness could be generated internally in the calculation process of the weight coefficients. A new weighted travel time function, that can handle more influence factors compared with the traditional travel time functions, is presented. In addition, a novel determination method of the weight coefficients of the presented function based on fuzzy soft set, dealing well with uncertainty and fuzziness, is proposed. Then, a user equilibrium assignment embedding the weighted travel time function is formulated. The validity and superiority of the weighted travel time function, that two typical travel time functions are used as the components, in the actual travel time estimation are validated. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), maximum absolute relative error (MARE), mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) indicate that the proposed travel time function has the superior estimating performance. The corresponding user equilibrium assignment are validated by an example related to a medium-size network. Link flow patterns and average travel time at equilibrium of the network are also investigated in the numerical example.

AB This paper presents an improved arithmetic optimization algorithm that incorporates hybrid elite pool strategies to address the limitations of the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA). In AOA, the linear mathematical optimization acceleration (MOA) function cannot balance global exploitation and local exploration well. Therefore, the accuracy and convergence speed of the algorithm cannot be guaranteed. To improve the performance of AOA, this paper reconstructed a nonlinear MOA function, which is expected to balance the exploitation and the exploration of AOA. Furthermore, four hybrid elite pool strategies are integrated to enhance the ability to escape local optima. The proposed algorithm inherits the fast convergence of AOA and develops the performance of escaping local optima. Numerical experiment results on benchmark functions and engineering problems show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other compared meta-heuristic algorithms in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.

AB In this research, the problem of optimal conjunctive operation of surface and groundwater systems is investigated by proposing a cyclic storage approach. This problem is solved here using mathematical programming and some efficient Meta heuristic algorithms. For this purpose, the mathematical model of this system is defined and first solved by the nonlinear programming (NLP) method. In addition, the performance of the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA), gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms are also studied to solve this problem. Here, two case studies, meaning a hypothetical benchmark system and conjunctive use of Buchan dam reservoir and Miandoab aquifer located in the catchment area of Urmia Lake (ZarrinehRoud catchment area) as a real problem, are considered to study the performance of proposed methods. In other words, for the hypothetical benchmark system, the results show that the optimal operating cost and related computational time are equal to 5.2428 Billion Rials and 5400 s, respectively, obtained by using the NLP method. In addition, in comparison with the result of the NLP method, the operation costs increased by 26.36%, 26.1%, 44.91% and, 21.28% using ABC, GA, GSA and, PSO algorithms, respectively. However, the computational time is extremely decreased in comparison with the related value of the NLP method using these algorithms for a particular case. In other words, for the real benchmark system, the results show that the optimal operating cost and related computational time are equal to 139.0145 Billion Rials and 259,200 s, respectively, obtained by using the NLP method. In addition, in comparison with the result of the NLP method, the operation costs increased by 43.74%, 32.32%, and 50.57% using ABC, GA and, PSO algorithms, respectively. However, by using this algorithm, the computational time is extremely decreased in comparison with the related value of the NLP method for a particular case. Furthermore, in both case studies, the water demands are fully stratified using the proposed methods. Therefore, the obtained results show the efficiency and effectivity of the proposed methods to solve this complex optimization problem considering a cyclic storage approach.

Based on the dominance-inferiority relation and the dominance-inferiority-based rough set, the dominance-inferiority degree and dominance-inferiority neighborhood degree are then proposed, respectively. Then, according to these newly proposed degrees, a novel multiple-attribute decision-making method is designed. Finally, the effectiveness, accuracy, and non-randomness of the new method are verified through comparison of methods via ROC curves.

AB The world steel industry is highly dependent on the use of electric arc furnaces (EAFs). The application of the electric arc phenomenon causes many power quality (PQ) problems, such as harmonics or voltage flickering. An adequate EAF model is useful for the design and control of EAFs and PQ improvement systems. In this paper, we propose an approach to EAF modeling based on a deterministic differential equation that is enhanced with stochastic ingredients. The identification of time series that represent equation coefficients is carried out using a genetic algorithm. The final solution includes two models of the electric arc furnace, both based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. They recreate the time series of the coefficients with given stochastic properties. The first model uses LSTM to generate the main component of the output signal, while the second applies LSTM to include the high frequency component. The potential of LSTM models to reflect different stages of the EAF work cycle, that is, the melting and refining stages, has been investigated. The results indicate that the LTSM model outperforms chaotic or stochastic models in both stages considered.

TI RINX: A system for information and knowledge extraction from resumes

AB A resume is a detailed source of information about the candidate which summarizes the personal details, education, career history, project experience, certifications, trainings, awards, and any other achievements. For large organizations or job portals which receive thousands of resumes for recruitment or profile creation, it is not possible to manually go through each resume and identify the important information. Hence, there is a need for a system that automatically extracts the information of interest from the resumes. Such automatic extraction of information from resumes is very challenging because resumes are unstructured documents with a wide range of variations in terms of format, style, and contents. In this paper, we describe RINX (Resume INformation eXtraction) which is an end-to-end system for automatic extraction of information from resumes. RINX heavily utilizes traditional approaches like linguistic patterns and gazettes for information extraction. RINX also complements these traditional approaches with state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning based techniques. We further describe a few knowledge extraction techniques as well as several real-life use-cases based on the information extracted from a large repository of resumes.

AB Diathesis alternations are the possible expressions of the arguments of verbs in different, systematically related subcategorization frames. Semantically similar verbs such as spill and spray can behave differently with respect to the alternations they can participate in. For example one can "spill/spray water on the plant", but while one can "spray the plant with water", it is odd to say "spill the plant with water". "Spray"is a verb which can alternate between syntactic frames while "spill"is not alternating. How human speakers learn the difference between such verbs is not clearly understood, because the primary linguistic data (PLD) they receive does not appear sufficient to infer the knowledge required for adult competence. More generally the poverty of the stimulus (POS) hypothesis states that the PLD is not sufficient for a learner to infer full adult competence of language. That is, learning relies on prior constraints introduced by the language faculty. We tested state-of-the-art machine learning models trained by self supervision, and found some evidence that they could in fact learn the correct pattern of acceptability judgement in the locative alternation. However, we argued that this was partially a result of fine-tuning which introduced negative evidence into the learning data, which facilitated shortcut learning. Large language models (LLMs) cannot learn some linguistic facts from normal language data, but they can compensate to some extent by learning spurious correlated features when negative feedback is introduced during the training cycle.

DE Skyline queries; Decisive subspaces; Query processing
ID EFFICIENT SKYLINE; COMPUTATION
AB Skyline queries have emerged as an increasingly popular tool for identifying a set of interesting objects that balance different user-specified criteria. Although in several applications the user aims to detect data objects that have values as good as possible in all specified criteria, skyline queries fail to identify only those objects. Instead, objects whose values are good in a subset of the given criteria are also included in the skyline set, even though they may take arbitrarily bad values in the remaining criteria. To alleviate this shortcoming, we study the decisive subspaces that express the semantics of skyline points and determine skyline membership. We propose a novel alternative query, called decisive skyline query, which retrieves a set of points that balance all specified criteria. We study two variants of the proposed query, the strict variant, which retrieves only the subset of skyline points that have the full data space as decisive subspace, and the relaxed variant, which imposes the decisive semantics in a more flexible way. Furthermore, we present pruning properties that accelerate the process of finding the decisive skyline set. Capitalizing on these pruning properties, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for computing decisive skyline points. Our experimental study, which employs both synthetic and real data sets for various experimental setups, demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm, and shows that the newly proposed query is more intuitive and informative for the user.

AB The surface electromyography (sEMG) signal is a complex interference pattern resulting from the electrical activity of contracting muscles, which directly correlates with muscle activity and exercise level. Patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PF OA) refers to the softening and destruction of the articular cartilage of the knee cap, which is important to diagnose in the early phase. The aim of this study is to develop a predictive model, called the Enhanced Sequencing Deep Learning (PESDL) Algorithm, to detect PF OA from the sEMG signal. The algorithm consists of four main modules: (i) Data Acquisition Module (DAM), (ii) Signal Preprocessing Module (SPM), (iii) Data Augmentation and Concatenation Module (DACM), and (iv) Lower Limb Classification (LLC). The sEMG signals from five core muscles of the lower limb were acquired during stepping stairs up and down, and machine learning was used to obtain the muscle activation data signals. The acquired data was preprocessed, augmented, concatenated, and shuffled. Three feedforward deep networks (RNN, LSTM, and GRU) were used to classify the lower limb sEMG time-sequence data, with the GRU network showing better performance than the other two. The model's performance was evaluated using seven performance measures and 10-fold cross-validation. The maximum values of feedforward deep networks (RNN), LSTM, and GRU for the five muscles (RF, BF, VM, ST, and FX) using seven performance measures were as follows: RNN (0.961, 0.154, 0.943, 0.244, 1.0, 1.0, 0.899), LSTM (0.967, 0.147, 0.945, 0.217, 0.997, 1.0, 0.927), and GRU (0.976, 0.111, 0.949, 0.212, 0.996, 0.998, 0.938), respectively, listed in the order of accuracy, loss, validation accuracy, validation loss, recall, precision, and F1 -score. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models using the same datasets demonstrated the effective per-formance of the predictive model. The results suggest that RNN models, particularly GRU and LSTM, can be effective for detecting PF OA, and the specific RNN architecture used can have a significant impact on performance.

AB In this manuscript we consider the problem of kernel classification. While worst-case bounds on the decay rate of the prediction error with the number of samples are known for some classifiers, they often fail to accurately describe the learning curves of real data sets. In this work, we consider the important class of data sets satisfying the standard source and capacity conditions, comprising a number of real data sets as we show numerically. Under the Gaussian design, we derive the decay rates for the misclassification (prediction) error as a function of the source and capacity coefficients. We do so for two standard kernel classification settings, namely margin-maximizing support vector machines and ridge classification, and contrast the two methods. We find that our rates tightly describe the learning curves for this class of data sets, and are also observed on real data. Our results can also be seen as an explicit prediction of the exponents of a scaling law for kernel classification that is accurate on some real datasets.

AB Learning over the domain of 3D graphs has applications in a number of scientific and engineering disciplines, including molecular chemistry, high energy physics, and computer vision. We consider a specific problem in this domain, namely: given one such 3D graph, dubbed the base graph, our goal is to learn a conditional distribution over another such graph, dubbed the complement graph. Due to the three-dimensional nature of the graphs in question, there are certain natural invariances such a distribution should satisfy: it should be invariant to rigid body transformations that act jointly on the base graph and the complement graph, and it should also be invariant to permutations of the vertices of either graph. We propose a general method for learning the conditional probabilistic model, the central part of which is a continuous normalizing flow. We establish semi-equivariance conditions on the flow which guarantee the aforementioned invariance conditions on the conditional distribution. Additionally, we propose a graph neural network architecture which implements this flow, and which is designed to learn effectively despite the typical differences in size between the base graph and the complement graph. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in the molecular setting by training a conditional generative model which, given a receptor, can generate ligands which may successfully bind to that receptor. The resulting model, which has potential applications in drug design, displays high quality performance in the key & UDelta;Binding metric.

This novel extension of flow-based sampling to the isobaric-isothermal ensemble yields direct estimates of Gibbs free energies. We test our NPT-flow on monatomic water in the cubic and hexagonal ice phases and find excellent agreement of Gibbs free energies and other observables compared with established baselines.

AB Highly transparent material classification can play an important role in the field of computer vision to classify glass or plastics for recycling and for home service robots to recognize transparent material. In these areas, there is a need to classify materials that are more than 73% transparent, but current transparent material classification methods cannot classify materials with full transparency levels. This paper proposes a highly transparent material classification method based on the refractive index, reflectivity, and transmissivity features from an imaging model of a time-of-flight (ToF) camera as the classification feature. First, we use the ToF camera to collect the depth and light intensity of the transparent material, as well as the scene information. The acquisition depth is distorted owing to the material characteristics of transparent materials. Second, we estimate the refractive index, reflectance, and transmittance from the depth distortion and IR (infrared rays) image. Finally, we choose a classifier that conforms to the nonlinear characteristics of the data to achieve transparent material classification. The method's classification accuracy reached 94.1% in an experiment, indicating that our method considers the unique phenomenon of highly transparent materials reflecting against the background, incorporates this phenomenon into the ToF distance model, it can extract material features that express the characteristics of highly transparent materials, making it applicable to the classification of transparent materials at all levels of transparency.

AB Efficiently representing dynamic textures (DTs) is one of the significant challenges for video understanding in real implementations of computer vision applications. In this work, an efficient approach for DT description is introduced by addressing the following prominent concepts. Firstly, high-order 2D/3D Gaussian-gradient filtering kernels are used for filtering a given video to obtain its Gaussian-gradient-filtered images/volumes. Secondly, taking advantage of the polarizing property of these responses, we propose a competent model of decomposition to decompose them into corresponding robust collections of separately polarized outcomes, which are complementary to DT representation. Finally, a simple variant of local binary patterns (LBPs) is applied to extract local polarized Gaussian-gradient features from the complemented collections for constructing discriminative local-based descriptors. Experimental results for DT recognition on benchmark datasets have remarkably validated the efficacy of our proposal.

AB Understanding the driving task-relevant attention (i.e. when to pay more attention?) is beneficial for improved safety in intelligent vehicles. Modeling driving task-relevant attention is challenging because it requires a collective understanding of multiple environmental risk factors in a given traffic scene. We formulate this research problem as a learning to rank task when given a traffic scene from a vehicle-mounted camera, we output an attention score that represents the required driver attention level. In this manner, we explicitly enforce the inherent ordering present in the different required attention levels in addition to a clear separation of attention levels. First, we learn a ranking function by contrasting two traffic scenes at a time using a pairwise ranking loss. Then, we introduce a novel triplet ranking architecture to model driving task-relevant attention with improved accuracy and train time. We evaluate our proposed method using traffic scenes from the Berkeley DeepDrive dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing classifier-based methods by a significant margin.

   Epistemological challenges; Interpreting phenomena
AB The humanities and social sciences (HSS) are being turned upside down by advances in artificial intelligence (AI), and their very existence could be threatened. These sciences are being profoundly destabilised by a dual process of naturalisation of social phenomena and fetishisation of numbers, accentuated by the development of AI (part 1). Both STM (science, technology, medicine) and HSS are facing major epistemological challenges, but for the latter they carry the risk of marginalisation (part 2). The humanities and social sciences remain the best equipped to question the social construct represented by the development of AI. However, this essential approach is not enough. We need to ask ourselves: how can the HSS reintroduce interpretation when they have less and less control over how data is put together? Only a balanced partnership between STM and HSS is likely to meet all these challenges (part 3). Using the case of education, which has long been at the forefront of developments in other sectors of social life, we would like to show how and on what priority issues such a partnership can be built (part 4).

AB In mountainous areas, mass movements are among the most dangerous natural hazards. Infrastructure is a crucial component and is thought of as human wealth. This infrastructure is frequently impacted by mass movements, whose frequency and size are anticipated to rise in the future due to the unequal distribution of rainfall events brought on by climate change. To deal with the anticipated repercussions, the study area, the Northern part of Morocco, needs to implement new management and maintenance practices. Thus, the main motivation of this study was to examine the mass movement vulnerability and assess risk on infrastructures in two provinces of North Morocco, i.e. Chefchaouen and Tetouan. The present study employed Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree) and its ensemble with Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random SubSpace (i.e. REPTree(Bagging), REPTree(AdaBoost), and REPTree(RandomSubSpace)) for mass movement susceptibility mapping (MMSM) based on a comprehensive dataset of 100 mass movements locations which include debris flow, landslide, and rock fall during past 20 years (2000-2020) as well as 12 MM conditioning factors. The result revealed that REPTree(RandomSubSpace) is the most viable model for MMSM with AUC = 0.8656. In addition, REPTree(Bagging), REPTree(AdaBoost), and REPTree models also offer acceptable results with AUC of 0.8338, 0.8269, and 0.7942, respectively. After MMSM, the infrastructural risk was assessed and the result showed that among the six infrastructural features considered, buildings and forests have a greater risk of mass movement in the study area. Most of the mass movement and infrastructural risk-prone areas are found in the central and north-eastern parts of the study area. The results further revealed that elevation, land use, lithology, rainfall, and distance from roads are important variables for mass movement and infrastructure risk assessment (IRA). The results of this study offer a systematic sight for decision-makers to mitigate natural disasters and infrastructural risk in the study region. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a new optimizer is presented to quickly and accurately identify parameters of the photovoltaic (PV) module/string models. This optimizer is named Nested Loop Biogeography-based Optimization -Differential Evolution referred to as (NLBBODE). It has been developed to identify the PV parameters with reasonable computational effort and minimum execution time, despite the nonlinearity of the PV system dynamics and the insufficiency of data. In addition, the NLBBODE optimizer is used to solve some engineering design problems known as highly constrained, nonlinear, and non-convex. The weaknesses of the original versions of BBO and DE approaches have been overpassed. Furthermore, the proposed optimizer is compared to the state-of-the-art metaheuristic methods using performance evaluation metrics. The computational resources needed to obtain the optimum solution using NLBBODE are significantly reduced due to the nested loop design. The results obtained prove that the NLBBODE optimizer is a suitable candidate to solve the problem of the PV modeling as well as to solve various real-world constrained optimization problems, with high accuracy and low processor runtime, which is a necessary condition for online applications. For instance, the well-known Photowatt-PWP-201 module model represented in the single diode model, NLBBODE registers a standard deviation value of 1.4682E-17 within a time of 13.9 s. For the STM6-40/36 module model represented in the single diode model, the NLBBODE optimizer records a standard deviation value of 6.191583E-18 within an execution time of 6 s. For the speed reducer design problem, the standard deviation obtained by the NLBBODE is 1.515824E-13 and needs a time of less than 1 s to obtain the optimum solution.

ID UAV; INSPECTION
AB To improve accuracy and robustness of interactive aerial robots, the knowledge of the forces acting on the platform is of uttermost importance. The robot should distinguish interaction forces from external disturbances in order to be compliant with the firsts and reject the seconds. This represents a challenge since disturbances might be of different nature (physical contact, aerodynamic, modeling errors) and be applied to different points of the robot. This work presents a new extended Kalman filter (EKF) based estimator for both external disturbance and interaction forces. The estimator fuses information coming from the system's dynamic model and it's state with wrench measurements coming from a Force-Torque sensor. This allows for robust interaction control at the tool's tip even in presence of external disturbance wrenches acting on the platform. We employ the filter estimates in a novel hybrid force/motion controller to perform force tracking not only along the tool direction, but from any platform's orientation, without losing the stability of the pose controller. The proposed framework is extensively tested on an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (AM) performing push and slide operations and transitioning between different interaction surfaces, while subject to external disturbances. The experiments are done equipping the AMwith two different tools: a rigid interaction stick and an actuated delta manipulator, showing the generality of the approach. Moreover, the estimation results are compared to a state-of-the-art momentum-based estimator, clearly showing the superiority of the EKF approach.

AB As an effective way to develop children's computational thinking, programming education has been intensively studied by scholars. Among them, tangible programming is more in line with children's cognitive development and inherently supports collaborative learning. However, most of the tangible programming systems fall short in effectively stimulating active collaboration among children effectively. In this paper, we present CoAR-Maze, an augmented reality (AR) based tangible programming system that incorporates a collaborative mechanism designed for children's programming. The system assists children in learning programming concepts such as sequences, loops, conditional statements, and task decomposition, while emphasizing the stimulation of active collaboration and enhancing immersion in children's programming learning. User studies validate the effectiveness, usability, and support for collaboration among child users provided by the system.

AB Advancements in autonomy are leading to an increased need for machines capable of collaborative effort with humans to achieve team goals. One way of enhancing these human-autonomous system work arrangements leverages the concept of a shared mental model. The idea being that when the human and autonomous teammate have aligned models, the team is more productive due to an increase in trust, predictiveness, and apparent understanding. An open issue is how to have autonomous teammates learn a user aligned mental model. This research presents a dual-process learning model that leverages multivariate normal probability density functions (DPL-MN) to extrapolate state-responses into system 2. By leveraging dual-process learning concepts, an autonomous teammate is able to rapidly align with a user and extrapolate their consistencies into longer term memory.

AB We introduce our implementation in HOL Light of the metatheory for Godel-Lob provability logic (GL), covering soundness and completeness w.r.t. possible world semantics and featuring a prototype of a theorem prover for GL itself. The strategy we develop here to formalise the modal completeness proof overcomes the technical difficulty due to the non-compactness of GL and is an adaptation-according to the formal language and tools at hand-of the proof given in George Boolos' 1995 monograph. Our theorem prover for GL relies then on this formalisation, is implemented as a tactic of HOL Light that mimics the proof search in the labelled sequent calculus G3KGL, and works as a decision algorithm for the provability logic: if the algorithm positively terminates, the tactic succeeds in producing a HOL Light theorem stating that the input formula is a theorem of GL; if the algorithm negatively terminates, the tactic extracts a model falsifying the input formula. We discuss our code for the formal proof of modal completeness and the design of our proof search algorithm. Furthermore, we propose some examples of the latter's interactive and automated use.

AB The broadband frequency output of gravitational-wave (GW) detectors is a non-stationary and non-Gaussian time series data stream dominated by noise populated by local disturbances and transient artifacts, which evolve on the same timescale as the GW signals and may corrupt the astrophysical information. We study a denoising algorithm dedicated to expose the astrophysical signals by employing a convolutional neural network in the encoder-decoder configuration, i.e. apply the denoising procedure of coalescing binary black hole signals to the publicly available LIGO O1 time series strain data. The denoising convolutional autoencoder neural network is trained on a dataset of simulated astrophysical signals injected into the real detector's noise and a dataset of detector noise artifacts ('glitches'), and its fidelity is tested on real GW events from O1 and O2 LIGO-Virgo observing runs.

   neural networks; machine learning model expressivity; quantum algorithms
AB Quantum machine learning has become an area of growing interest but has certain theoretical and hardware-specific limitations. Notably, the problem of vanishing gradients, or barren plateaus, renders the training impossible for circuits with high qubit counts, imposing a limit on the number of qubits that data scientists can use for solving problems. Independently, angle-embedded supervised quantum neural networks were shown to produce truncated Fourier series with a degree directly dependent on two factors: the depth of the encoding and the number of parallel qubits the encoding applied to. The degree of the Fourier series limits the model expressivity. This work introduces two new architectures whose Fourier degrees grow exponentially: the sequential and parallel exponential quantum machine learning architectures. This is done by efficiently using the available Hilbert space when encoding, increasing the expressivity of the quantum encoding. Therefore, the exponential growth allows staying at the low-qubit limit to create highly expressive circuits avoiding barren plateaus. Practically, parallel exponential architecture was shown to outperform the existing linear architectures by reducing their final mean square error value by up to 44.7% in a one-dimensional test problem. Furthermore, the feasibility of this technique was also shown on a trapped ion quantum processing unit.

AB Improving the resilience of sensor systems in space exploration is a key objective since the environmental conditions to which they are exposed are very harsh. For example, it is known that the presence of flying debris and Dust Devils on the Martian surface can partially damage sensors present in rovers/landers. The objective of this work is to show how data-driven methods can improve sensor resilience, particularly in the case of complex sensors, with multiple intermediate variables, feeding an inverse algorithm (IA) based on calibration data. The method considers three phases: an initial phase in which the sensor is calibrated in the laboratory and an IA is designed; a second phase, in which the sensor is placed at its intended location and sensor data is used to train data-driven model; and a third phase, once the model has been trained and partial damage is detected, in which the data-driven algorithm is reducing errors. The proposed method is tested with the intermediate data of the wind sensor of the TWINS instrument (NASA InSight mission), consisting of two booms placed on the deck of the lander, and three boards per boom. Wind speed and angle are recovered from the intermediate variables provided by the sensor and predicted by the proposed method. A comparative analysis of various data-driven methods including machine learning and deep learning (DL) methods is carried out for the proposed research. It is shown that even a simple method such as k-nearest neighbor is capable of successfully recovering missing data of a board compared to complex DL models. Depending on the selected missing board, errors are reduced by a factor between 2.43 and 4.78, for horizontal velocity; and by a factor between 1.74 and 4.71, for angle, compared with the situation of using only the two remaining boards.

ID PERSISTENCE
AB Topological data analysis (TDA) characterizes the global structure of data based on topological invariants such as persistent homology, whereas convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are capable of characterizing local features in the global structure of the data. In contrast, a combined model of TDA and CNN, a family of multimodal networks, simultaneously takes the image and the corresponding topological features as the input to the network for classification, thereby significantly improving the performance of a single CNN. This innovative approach has been recently successful in various applications. However, there is a lack of explanation regarding how and why topological signatures, when combined with a CNN, improve discriminative power. In this paper, we use persistent homology to compute topological features and subsequently demonstrate both qualitatively and quantitatively the effects of topological signatures on a CNN model, for which the Grad-CAM analysis of multimodal networks and topological inverse image map are proposed and appropriately utilized. For experimental validation, we utilize two famous datasets: the transient versus bogus image dataset and the HAM10000 dataset. Using Grad-CAM analysis of multimodal networks, we demonstrate that topological features enforce the image network of a CNN to focus more on significant and meaningful regions across images rather than task-irrelevant artifacts such as background noise and texture.

AB We test the efficiency of applying geometric deep learning to the problems in low-dimensional topology in a certain simple setting. Specifically, we consider the class of 3-manifolds described by plumbing graphs and use graph neural networks (GNN) for the problem of deciding whether a pair of graphs give homeomorphic 3-manifolds. We use supervised learning to train a GNN that provides the answer to such a question with high accuracy. Moreover, we consider reinforcement learning by a GNN to find a sequence of Neumann moves that relates the pair of graphs if the answer is positive. The setting can be understood as a toy model of the problem of deciding whether a pair of Kirby diagrams give diffeomorphic 3- or 4-manifolds.

AB We propose a multi-view stereo network based on multi-distribution fitting (MDF-Net), which achieves high-resolution depth map prediction with low memory and high efficiency. This method adopts a four-stage cascade structure, which mainly has the following three contributions. First, view cost regularization is proposed to weaken the influence of matching noise on building the cost volume. Second, it is suggested to adaptively calculate the depth refinement interval using multi-distribution fitting (MDF). Gaussian distribution fitting is used to refine and correct depth within a large interval, and then Laplace distribution fitting is used to accurately estimate depth within a small interval. Third, the lightweight image super-resolution network is applied to upsample the depth map in the fourth stage to reduce running time and memory requirements. The experimental results on the DTU dataset indicate that MDF-Net has achieved the most advanced results. It has the lowest memory consumption and running time among the high-resolution reconstruction methods, requiring only approximately 4.29G memory for predicting a depth map with the resolution of 1600 x 1184. In addition, we validate the generalization ability on Tanks and Temples dataset, achieving very competitive performance. The code has been released at https://github.com/zongh5a/MDF-Net.

AB Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning have been widely used in various fields of mathematical computing, physical modeling, computational science, communication science, and stochastic analysis. Approaches based on Deep Artificial Neural Networks (DANN) are very popular in our days. Depending on the learning task, the exact form of DANNs is determined via their multi-layer architecture, activation functions and the so-called loss function. However, for a majority of deep learning approaches based on DANNs, the kernel structure of neural signal processing remains the same, where the node response is encoded as a linear superposition of neural activity, while the non-linearity is triggered by the activation functions. In the current paper, we suggest to analyze the neural signal processing in DANNs from the point of view of homogeneous chaos theory as known from polynomial chaos expansion (PCE). From the PCE perspective, the (linear) response on each node of a DANN could be seen as a 1st degree multi-variate polynomial of single neurons from the previous layer, i.e. linear weighted sum of monomials. From this point of view, the conventional DANN structure relies implicitly (but erroneously) on a Gaussian distribution of neural signals. Additionally, this view revels that by design DANNs do not necessarily fulfill any orthogonality or orthonormality condition for a majority of data-driven applications. Therefore, the prevailing handling of neural signals in DANNs could lead to redundant representation as any neural signal could contain some partial information from other neural signals. To tackle that challenge, we suggest to employ the data-driven generalization of PCE theory known as arbitrary polynomial chaos (aPC) to construct a corresponding multi-variate orthonormal representations on each node of a DANN. Doing so, we generalize the conventional structure of DANNs to Deep arbitrary polynomial chaos neural networks (DaPC NN). They decompose the neural signals that travel through the multi-layer structure by an adaptive construction of datadriven multi-variate orthonormal bases for each layer. Moreover, the introduced DaPC NN provides an opportunity to go beyond the linear weighted superposition of single neurons on each node. Inheriting fundamentals of PCE theory, the DaPC NN offers an additional possibility to account for high-order neural effects reflecting simultaneous interaction in multi-layer networks. Introducing the high-order weighted superposition on each node of the network mitigates the necessity to introduce non-linearity via activation functions and, hence, reduces the room for potential subjectivity in the modeling procedure. Although the current DaPC NN framework has no theoretical restrictions on the use of activation functions. The current paper also summarizes relevant properties of DaPC NNs inherited from aPC as analytical expressions for statistical quantities and sensitivity indexes on each node. We also offer an analytical form of partial derivatives that could be used in various training algorithms. Technically, DaPC NNs require similar training procedures as conventional DANNs, and all trained weights determine automatically the corresponding multi-variate data-driven orthonormal bases for all layers of DaPC NN. The paper makes use of three test cases to illustrate the performance of DaPC NN, comparing it with the performance of the conventional DANN and also with plain aPC expansion.
   Evidence of convergence over the training data size against validation data sets demonstrates that the DaPC NN outperforms the conventional DANN systematically. Overall, the suggested re-formulation of the kernel network structure in terms of homogeneous chaos theory is not limited to any particular architecture or any particular definition of the loss function. The DaPC NN Matlab Toolbox is available online and users are invited to adopt it for own needs. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Unsupervised feature selection based on variance-covariance subspace
   distance
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Feature selection; Subspace distance; Subspace learning; Regularization
AB Subspace distance is an invaluable tool exploited in a wide range of feature selection methods. The power of subspace distance is that it can identify a representative subspace, including a group of features that can efficiently approximate the space of original features. On the other hand, employing intrinsic statistical information of data can play a significant role in a feature selection process. Nevertheless, most of the existing feature selection methods founded on the subspace distance are limited in properly fulfilling this objective. To pursue this void, we propose a framework that takes a subspace distance into account which is called "Variance-Covariance subspace distance". The approach gains advantages from the correlation of information included in the features of data, thus determines all the feature subsets whose corresponding Variance-Covariance matrix has the minimum norm property. Consequently, a novel, yet efficient unsupervised feature selection framework is introduced based on the Variance-Covariance distance to handle both the dimensionality reduction and subspace learning tasks. The proposed framework has the ability to exclude those features that have the least variance from the original feature set. Moreover, an efficient update algorithm is provided along with its associated convergence analysis to solve the optimization side of the proposed approach. An extensive number of experiments on nine benchmark datasets are also conducted to assess the performance of our method from which the results demonstrate its superiority over a variety of stateof-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.

TI Node injection for class-specific network poisoning
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adversarial attack; Network poisoning; Graph Neural Networks
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful in learning rich network representations that aid the performance of downstream tasks. However, recent studies showed that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks involving node injection and network perturbation. Among these, node injection attacks are more practical as they do not require manipulation in the existing network and can be performed more realistically. In this paper, we propose a novel problem statement - a class-specific poison attack on graphs in which the attacker aims to misclassify specific nodes in the target class into a different class using node injection. Additionally, nodes are injected in such a way that they camouflage as benign nodes. We propose NICKI, a novel attacking strategy that utilizes an optimization-based approach to sabotage the performance of GNN-based node classifiers. NICKI works in two phases - it first learns the node representation and then generates the features and edges of the injected nodes. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four benchmark networks show that NICKI is consistently better than four baseline attacking strategies for misclassifying nodes in the target class. We also show that the injected nodes are properly camouflaged as benign, thus making the poisoned graph indistinguishable from its clean version w.r.t various topological properties.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the theoretical analysis on exponential synchronization of a class of coupled switched neural networks suffering from stochastic disturbances and impulses is presented. A control law is developed and two sets of sufficient conditions are derived for the synchronization of coupled switched neural networks. First, for desynchronizing stochastic impulses, the synchronization of coupled switched neural networks is analyzed by Lyapunov function method, the comparison principle and a impulsive delay differential inequality. Then, for general stochastic impulses, by partitioning impulse interval and using the convex combination technique, a set of sufficient condition on the basis of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is derived for the synchronization of coupled switched neural networks. Eventually, two numerical examples and a practical application are elaborated to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reconstructing visual experience from brain responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a challenging yet important research topic in brain decoding, especially it has proved more difficult to decode visually similar stimuli, such as faces. Although face attributes are known as the key to face recognition, most existing methods generally ignore how to decode facial attributes more precisely in perceived face reconstruction, which often leads to indistinguishable reconstructed faces. To solve this problem, we propose a novel neural decoding framework called VSPnet (voxel2style2pixel) by establishing hierarchical encoding and decoding networks with disentangled latent representations as media, so that to recover visual stimuli more elaborately. And we design a hierarchical visual encoder (named HVE) to pre-extract features containing both high-level semantic knowledge and low-level visual details from stimuli. The proposed VSPnet consists of two networks: Multi-branch cognitive encoder and style-based image generator. The encoder network is constructed by multiple linear regression branches to map brain signals to the latent space provided by the preextracted visual features and obtain representations containing hierarchical information consistent to the corresponding stimuli. We make the generator network inspired by StyleGAN to untangle the complexity of fMRI representations and generate images. And the HVE network is composed of a standard feature pyramid over a ResNet backbone. Extensive experimental results on the latest public datasets have demonstrated the reconstruction accuracy of our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and the identifiability of different reconstructed faces has been greatly improved. In particular, we achieve feature editing for several facial attributes in fMRI domain based on the multiview (i.e., visual stimuli and evoked fMRI) latent representations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, a rapid, easy, and convenient access to our private information is essential to carry out both personal and professional activities. In most cases, this information is sensitive and can be stolen due to its importance and the lack of security protocols. In this study we propose a time-invariant cryptographic key generation mechanism based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We employed Discrete Wavelet Transform and autoencoders to extract the biometric features from the EEG signals. Using these features, we construct a scheme to generate secure seeds that can be used as inputs for secure hash functions and obtain cryptographic keys. The mechanism proposed preserves the privacy of the user, as the cryptographic key is generated for each new EEG signal received, avoiding the need of storing the key, previous EEG signals or any other information. Results show that the proposed mechanism is secure against random attacks, as a 0% of False Acceptance Rate is reported, while generating seeds with an entropy of 0.968 in less than 500 ms.

ID SYSTEM
AB Human-machine interaction (HMI) establishes an interconnected bridge between humans and robots and plays a significant role in industry and medical fields. However, the conventional interface is bulky and rigid with a single function. It lacks feedback information to be provided to the user, limiting its application scenarios and the ability to complete complex tasks in a dynamic environment. Herein, a flexible bidirectional (FBD) interface with integrated multimodal sensing and haptic feedback and the development of an FBD-based closed-loop HMI platform are presented. The proposed FBD interface offers programmable haptic feedback through a coin vibration motor array to endow the user with better performance in missions. The multimodal sensing array can perceive signals of joint movement and the pressure imposed on the skin. In addition, the FBD interface exhibits significant advantages of flexibility and a compact structure. The experimental tests verify that the multimodal sensing module can accurately perceive various static and dynamic movements of a human. Furthermore, the actuation module can provide diverse haptic vibrations to convey different information to the user. Moreover, successful applications in the scenarios of bilateral robotic teleoperation and assistance of disabled people indicate great potential of the FBD interface for broad applications.
   A flexible electronic skin-based closed-loop human-machine interface with bidirectional sensing and haptic feedback functions is proposed. The strain sensing, pressure sensing, and vibration feedback functions are integrated into one device through structural design without mutual interference.

AB Radar high-resolution range profile (HRRP) is widely used in radar automatic target recognition due to its advantages such as easy availability, convenient processing, and small storage space. Current recognition methods for HRRP sequences mainly focus on the temporal information of HRRP sequences, which cannot fully utilize the temporal and spatial information contained in HRRP sequences. Moreover, most of these methods fail in long-range modeling and global information extraction of HRRP sequences. To solve above problems, a HRRP sequence recognition method based on transformer with temporal-spatial fusion and label smoothing (TSF-transformer-LS) is proposed. TSF-transformer-LS contains temporal transformer blocks and spatial transformer blocks, which are used to extract deep global features of HRRP sequences in the time domain and space domain, respectively. Then, an attention fusion mechanism is developed to realize the adaptive fusion of temporal and spatial features. Moreover, label smoothing is used to add noise to sample labels, which can solve the overfitting problem of transformer caused by a large amount of noise hidden in HRRP in real scenes. Experiments on MSTAR, a standard dataset, show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in recognition performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness and interpretability of the method are explored.
   To further improve the performance of high-resolution range profile sequence recognition, a transformer with temporal-spatial fusion and label smoothing is proposed, which can extract deep global features in both temporal and spatial domains and adopt the attention fusion mechanism to realize efficient feature fusion. Besides, label smoothing regularization is utilized to solve the noise-induced overfitting problem.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB The objective of this work is to design a novel evolving fuzzy prediction interval for modeling a nonlinear system and to implement a novel interval-based algorithm for fault detection. To achieve these goals, three frameworks are studied to provide the basis for the ideas to be proposed. First, the prediction intervals developed in the literature to characterize the uncertainties in modeling systems. Second, the evolving intelligence systems presented in the literature to improve the predictive models through adaptability to temporal changes. Third, the model-based error detection algorithms that detect anomalies in system behavior based on the error of the models. This work proposes a complete recursive design of the evolving fuzzy prediction interval based on interval coverage estimation. This estimation is based on the accumulated number of past time points in which the interval contained the measurements of the modeled system. Additionally, a new interval-based fault detection algorithm is proposed in this work that determines the activation of alarms based on the increment of the proposed interval failure index. This novel index is similar in structure to the interval coverage estimation. The proposed recursively evolving fuzzy prediction interval and interval-based fault detection algorithm were tested on a heat exchanger system whose characteristics were affected by external changes. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed interval model in representing the dynamics of the heat exchanger. Furthermore, the experiment shows that the proposed fault detection algorithm achieves comparable accurate performance to the results of a previous model-based fault detection method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Nowadays, we can obtain a huge amount of information and data of railway dangerous goods transportation system through various technical documents, accident reports, monitoring technologies etc. For the space composed of massive historical information and data, a data-driven fault predication approach that can better grasp some important local information while ignoring the negative impact of other data in the global might be practical. However, we have the following challenges: (i) How to reduce the impact of unimportant information on prediction results in advance? (ii) What kind of local approximation data-driven approach should be applied, and (iii) How to correct the results and improve the reliability and accuracy after fault predication based on the local approximation datadriven approach? In this paper, two data-driven approaches including Back Propagation with Markov Correction and Radial Basis Function with Markov Correction are proposed to predicate the fault in a railway dangerous goods transportation system. In order to solve challenge (i), we decompose the whole transportation process into multiple sub-processes based on Work Breakdown Structure with clear duration boundary on the time axis, and use Risk Breakdown Structure to detect the possible faults in each sub-process. In order to solve challenge (ii), we use and compare Back Propagation/Radial Basis Function with global approximation/local approximation and nonlinear prediction ability to learn and predicate the fault based on the collected historical data. In order to solve challenge (iii), we correct the prediction results with fluctuating deviation by using Markov Correction due to its non-aftereffect. Finally, a case study is conducted based on the collected historical fault data of railway dangerous goods transportation system in China. The results show that, for the prediction results based on Back Propagation, the average error increases from 1.43 to 1.88 and the Mean Square Error increases from 3.27 to 5.60 after Markov Correction. For the prediction results based on Radial Basis Function, the average error decreases from 1.13 to 1.11 and the Mean Square Error decreases from 1.81 to 1.76 after Markov Correction. The non-aftereffect of Markov chain well corresponds to the local approximation of Radial Basis Function. When the prediction value is determined by some data of the series, Radial Basis Function with Markov Correction can be applied. When the prediction value is determined by all the data (small-scale) of the series, Back Propagation with Markov Correction is better. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem poses a complex optimization challenge, focused on maximizing the number of tasks executed by a satellite in orbit while adhering to Quality of Service constraints such as priority, execution time-frames, and resource management. Based on mixed integer programming, existing methods rely on branch-and-bound aided algorithms and can struggle to achieve satisfactory computational time performance. In order to avoid the computational burden of branch-and-bound, this work introduces the Column-Generation-based Genetic Algorithm (CGbGA) as a heuristic approach to the ONTS problem. The method, based on branch-and-price principles, combines Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem of interest efficiently. We generate solution vectors for each job using DP and adapt mutation and crossover operators to work on a column-wide scale. This ensures that every solution is valid for the given job. Also, a novel pseudo-shadow pricing strategy is employed to mimic the pricing procedure of the branch-and-price algorithm. To better understand the impact of the number of available columns on the incumbent solution, we employ Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). Our results, based on a set of representative literature instances, demonstrate the potential of CGbGA in terms of solution value and computational solving time compared to commercially available solvers. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of graph optimization's fundamental and most challenging problems is determining the maximum set of unconnected vertices in a graph, called the maximum independent set problem. This problem consists of finding the largest independent set in a graph, where an independent set is a set of vertices such that no two vertices are adjacent. This paper presents a new artificially generated algorithm for the maximum independent set problem. The new algorithm is generated by the automatic generation of algorithms, a technique that allows the construction of new hybrid algorithms, taking advantage of existing algorithms. Thus, the automatic generation of algorithms combines basic heuristics for the problem, a tabu search method selected from the literature, and an exact method that solves the problem's mathematical formulation working for a limited computational time. With these components, the space of possible algorithms is traversed by employing genetic programming. Algorithms of small sizes are generated to study their structure and discover new algorithmic combinations. Then, we select the algorithm that finds solutions with the best computational performance among all the generated algorithms. This best algorithm is compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms for the problem, presenting the best computational performance for the 131 instances in the literature. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Sequential recommendation; Deep learning; Time series embedding; Global

AB Since sequential recommendation can effectively capture the user's dynamic interaction pattern according to the user's historical interaction, it plays one of the important roles in the field of recommendation systems. Nowadays, the sequential recommendation models based on deep learning approaches have achieved good results in reality due to their excellent performance in information retrieval and filtering. However, there are still some challenges that still should be overcome of them. A major disadvantage of them is that they are only considering users' short-time interests while ignoring their long-term preferences. Moreover, they are incapable of considering the influence of time information in the original interaction sequence, which could be helpful to fully extract various patterns via the different temporal embedding forms. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel model named multi-temporal sequential recommendation model based on the fused learning preference named MTSR-FLP in short. In the proposed framework, this paper adopts an MLP-based state generation module to consider the user's long-term preferences and the short-time interests simultaneously. In particular, the proposed MTSR-FLP model designs a global representation learning approach to obtain the user's global preference, and a local representation learning approach to capture the users' local preference via its historical information. Moreover, the proposed model develops a multiple temporal embedding scheme to encode the positions of user-item interactions of a sequence, in which multiple kernels are utilized for the absolute or relative timestamps to establish unique embedding matrices. Finally, compared with other advanced sequence recommendation models on five public real-world datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed MTSR-FLP model has improved the performance of HR@10 from the 6.68% through 31.10% and NDCG@10 from the 8.60% through 42.54%.

ID ILLUMINANT ESTIMATION
AB Color constancy is still one of the biggest challenges in camera color processing. Convolutional neural networks have been able to improve the situation but there are still problems in many conditions, especially in scenes where a single color is dominating. In this work, we approach the problem from a slightly different setting. What if we could have some other information than the raw RGB image data. What kind of information would help to bring significant improvements while still be feasible in a mobile device. These questions sparked an idea for a novel approach for computational color constancy. Instead of raw RGB images used by the existing algorithms to estimate the scene white points, our approach is based on the scene's average color spectra-single pixel spectral measurement. We show that as few as 10-14 spectral channels are sufficient. Notably, the sensor output has five orders of magnitude less data than in raw RGB images of a 10MPix camera. The spectral sensor captures the "spectral fingerprints" of different light sources and the illuminant white point can be accurately estimated by a standard regressor. The regressor can be trained with generated measurements using the existing RGB color constancy datasets. For this purpose, we propose a spectral data generation pipeline that can be used if the dataset camera model is known and thus its spectral characterization can be obtained. To verify the results with real data, we collected a real spectral dataset with a commercial spectrometer. On all datasets the proposed Single Pixel Spectral Color Constancy obtains the highest accuracy in the both single and cross-dataset experiments. The method is particularly effective for the difficult scenes for which the average improvements are 40-70% compared to state-of-the-arts. The approach can be extended to multi-illuminant case for which the experimental results also provide promising results.

DE Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Graph convolutional network;
   Denpendency relation; Aspect extraction
AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has been extensively studied in recent years. It involves several subtasks for extracting one or more sentiment elements, including the aspect category, aspect term, opinion term, and sentiment polarity. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches to addressing different ABSA subtasks. Firstly, we introduce a Dependency-Attention GCN-based Aspect Opinion Extractor (DAG-AOE) for the Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction (AOPE) task. DAG-AOE employs an improved graph convolutional network to extract syntactic structure information from text sequences, thereby effectively identifying aspect-opinion pairs in sentences. Secondly, we propose a Mutual Assistance Mechanism-based Category Sentiment Classifier (MAM-CSC) that utilizes the results of DAG-AOE to address the Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction (ASQP) task. MAM-CSC leverages the semantic relationships between words in a sentence and addresses the two independent classification tasks through a mutual assistance approach. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our models have demonstrated a significant improvement over all baseline methods. Specifically, our models achieved the highest improvement of 1.4% F1 score over the baseline on the AOPE task and 1.5% F1 score on the ASQP task.

DE Opinion summarization; Multi-modal knowledge graph; Multi-modal data;
   Training pipeline
AB Multi-modal opinion summarization aims at automatically generating summaries of products or businesses from multi-modal reviews containing text, image and table to present clear references for other customers. To create faithful summaries, multi-modal structural knowledge should be well utilized, which is neglected by most existing work on multi-modal opinion summarization. Thus, we propose an opinion summarization framework based on multi-modal knowledge graphs (MKGOpinSum) to utilize structural knowledge in multi-modal data for opinion summarization. To construct a multi-modal knowledge graph, we first build a textual knowledge graph from review text and then enrich it by linking detected image objects to its corresponding entities. Our method obtains each modality representation from their own encoders, and generates the summary from the text decoder. To address the issue of heterogeneity of multi-modal data, we adopt a multi-modal training pipeline. In the pipeline we first pretrain text encoder and decoder with only text modality data. Then we respectively pretrain table and MKG modality by taking text decoder as a pivot. Finally, we train the entire encoder-decoder architecture and fuse representations of all modalities to generate the summary text. Experiments on Amazon and Yelp dataset show the framework has satisfactory performances when compared to ten baselines.

ID HAND; MANIPULATION; GRASP
AB In this paper, the design and development of an adaptive gripper are presented. Adaptive grippers are useful for grasping objects of varied geometric shapes by wrapping fingers around the object. The finger closing sequence in adaptive grippers may lead to ejection of the object from the gripper due to any unbalanced grasping force and such grasp failure is common for lightweight objects. Designing of the proposed gripper is focused on ensuring a stable grasp on a wide variety of objects, especially, lightweight objects (e.g., empty plastic bottles). The proposed actuation mechanism is based on movable pulleys and tendon wires which ensure that once a link stops moving, the other links continue to move and wrap around the object. Further, optimisation is used to improve the design of the adaptive gripper and the optimised gripper has been developed using 3D printing. Finally, validation is done by executing object grasping on common household objects using an industrial robot fitted with the developed gripper.

AB Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are machine learning models that integrate data-based learning with partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, for the first time we extend PINNs to model the numerically challenging case of astrophysical shock waves in the presence of a stellar gravitational field. Notably, PINNs suffer from competing losses during gradient descent that can lead to poor performance especially in physical setups involving multiple scales, which is the case for shocks in the gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere. We applied PINNs in three different setups ranging from modeling astrophysical shocks in cases with no or little data to data-intensive cases. Namely, we used PINNs (a) to determine the effective polytropic index controlling the heating mechanism of the space plasma within 1% error, (b) to quantitatively show that data assimilation is seamless in PINNs and small amounts of data can significantly increase the model's accuracy, and (c) to solve the forward time-dependent problem for different temporal horizons. We addressed the poor performance of PINNs through an effective normalization approach by reformulating the fluid dynamics PDE system to absorb the gravity-caused variability. This led to a huge improvement in the overall model performance with the density accuracy improving between 2 and 16 times. Finally, we present a detailed critique on the strengths and drawbacks of PINNs in tackling realistic physical problems in astrophysics and conclude that PINNs can be a powerful complimentary modeling approach to classical fluid dynamics solvers.

DT Article; Early Access
ID CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; PHASE-TRANSITION
AB We consider the car following problem for a set of autonomous vehicles following each other on either an infinite or circular road. The behavior of each car is specified by its "speed regulator", a device that decides to increase or decrease the speed of the car as a function of the head-tail distance to its predecessor and the speed of both cars. A collective behavior emerges that corresponds to previously proposed cellular automata traffic models. We further analyze the traffic patterns of the system in the long term, as governed by the speed regulator and we study under which conditions traffic patterns of maximum flow can or cannot be reach. We show the existence of suboptimal flow conditions that require external coordination mechanisms (that we do not consider in this paper) in order to reach the optimal flow achievable with the given density. In contrast with other approaches, we do not try to reproduce observed or measured traffic patterns. We analyze a deterministic speed regulator in order to decipher the emergent dynamics, and to ponder what maneuvers can be safely performed. Here, we restrict our attention to the car following problem. By comparing our speed regulator with classical models, auch as the Nagel-Schreckenberg and KKW models, we observe that although our regulator is formulated in simple terms, its dynamics share similarities with these models. In particular, the KKW model is designed to reproduce the observed behavior that a trailing car in the synchronization range of the leading car tends to regulate its speed to maintain a constant distance. this same behavior is adopted by our speed regulator, showing that this is a safe way of driving.

AB The performance of speech-based depression detectors is limited by the scarcity and imbalance in depression data. We found that depression detectors could be strongly biased toward speaker features when the number of training speakers is insufficient. To address this issue, we propose a speaker-invariant depression detector (SIDD) that minimizes speaker information in the latent space. The SIDD consists of an autoencoder, a depression classifier, and a speaker-embedding projector. By incorporating speaker-embedding vectors into the autoencoder's latent vectors, speaker information is effectively eliminated for the depression classifier. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements achieved by minimizing speaker information, and our proposed method generally outperforms previous approaches for depression detection on the DAIC-WOZ dataset.

AB Aerial-aquatic robots have promising applications due to their ability to operate in air and water with different motion modes. However, challenges such as water/air transition and multimedia movement still limit their development. Inspired by the aerial-aquatic behavior of wild ducks, an aerial-aquatic robot with tunable tilting motors and a delta wing is introduced. The robot can perform multimode motion, including flying in air, swimming on the water surface, transitioning between air and water, and diving underwater. Besides, the buoyancy design enables the robot to float at the air-water interface without consuming energy. Herein, the performance of the robot, including vertical and horizontal cross-media performance, power consumption, and endurance in various motion modes, is evaluated. The field experiments show that the proposed robot possesses multimode motion and high maneuverability. This study provides a new idea for the structural design of next-generation practical aerial-aquatic robots.
   Multienvironment robots are noteworthy. Inspired by the aerial-aquatic behaviors of wild ducks, an aerial-aquatic robot with tunable tilting motors combines the advantages of multirotor robots, fixed-wing robots, and underwater robots. The robot has multiple motion modes adapted to the environment and achieves multiple ways to break through the air-water interface.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID STRAIN SENSORS
AB Soft sensing technologies provide a novel alternative for state estimation in wearables and robotic systems. They allow one to capture intrinsic state parameters in a highly conformable manner. However, due to the nonlinearities in the materials that make up a soft sensor, it is difficult to develop accurate models of these systems. Consequently, design of these soft sensors is largely user defined or based on trial and error. Since these sensors conform and take the shape of the sensing body, these issues are further exacerbated when they are installed. Herein, a framework for the automated design optimization of soft sensors using closed-loop 3D printing of a recyclable hydrogel-based sensing material is presented. The framework allows direct printing of the sensor on the sensing body using visual feedback, evaluates the sensor performance, and iteratively improves the sensor design. Following preliminary investigations into the material and morphology parameters, this is demonstrated through the optimization of a sensorized glove which can be matched to specific tasks and individual hand shapes. The glove's sensors are tuned to respond only to particular hand poses, including distinguishing between two similar tennis racket grip techniques.
   This article presents a framework for the automated design optimization of soft sensors using closed-loop 3D printing of a recyclable gelatin hydrogel-based sensing material. The framework facilitates the direct printing of the sensor on the sensing body using a color and depth (RGB-D) visual feedback, evaluates the sensor performance, and iteratively improves the sensor design.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Sustainable management of construction and demolition wastes (CDWs) has become a pressing global issue in social, environmental and economic contexts, and it involves complex technological, engineering, management and regulatory challenges. Recently, many CDW management strategies have been developed based on the barrier attributes of reuse distribution. However, no strategy can simultaneously address all barrier attributes of reuse distribution. Furthermore, no research has assessed and modelled the identified CDW management strategies to determine optimality. On this basis, the presence of multiple barrier attributes, varying attribute priority and a wide range of data allow for the modelling of CDW management strategies under complex multiple-attribute decision -making (MADM) problems. This study develops the fuzzy-weighted zero inconsistency (FWZIC) and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM)-based multiplicative multiple objective optimisation by ratio analysis (MULTIMOORA) with the q-rung orthopair probabilistic hesitant fuzzy set (q-ROPHFS) to address this problem. The developed q-ROPHFS-FWZIC method prioritised and weighted the main and sub-barrier attributes of reuse distribution in CDW management strategies. The developed q-ROPHFS-FDOSM is used to score the CDW management strategies. Then, the MULTIMOORA method is used to model 51 CDW management strategies to determine the optimum one. Results showed that Strategy 46 modelled first in six q values because it had the most essential attributes (i.e. cost, market, value-for-money, experience, infrastructure, management, risk and trust). Strategy 17 and Strategy 20 are the least sustainable strategies because they had only one attribute (i.e. experience). Sensitivity analysis, systematic modelling and comparison analysis are conducted to validate and evaluate the stability and robustness of the proposed methods. The implications of this study would likely benefit various stakeholders involved in the construction industry, including construction companies, architects, engineers, policy-makers and members of the public.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

   Content evasion
AB Content moderation is the process of screening and monitoring user-generated content online. It plays a crucial role in stopping content resulting from unacceptable behaviors such as hate speech, harassment, violence against specific groups, terrorism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, or misogyny, to mention some few, in Online Social Platforms. These platforms make use of a plethora of tools to detect and manage malicious information; however, malicious actors also improve their skills, developing strategies to surpass these barriers and continuing to spread misleading information. Twisting and camouflaging keywords are among the most widely used techniques to evade platform content moderation systems. In response to this recent ongoing issue This paper presents an innovative approach to address this linguistic trend in social networks through the simulation of different content evasion techniques and a multilingual transformer model for content evasion detection. In this way a multilingual public tool Named "pyleetspeak"is shared with the scientific community, enabling the generation and simulation of content evasion through automatic word camouflage in a customizable way. Additionally a multilingual named-entity recognition (NER) transformer-based model is provided Designed for the recognition and detection of such evasion technique. The developed tool is multilingual Supporting over 20 languages (ar, az, da, de, el, en, es, fi, fr, hu, id, it, kk, nb, ne, nl, pt, ro, ru, sl, sv, tg, tr) and the NER model has been tested in English, Spanish, French, Italian, and German. This multilingual NER model is evaluated in different textual scenarios Detecting different types and mixtures of camouflage techniques Achieving an overall weighted F1 score of 0.8795. This article contributes significantly to countering malicious information by developing multilingual tools to simulate and detect new methods of evasion of content on social networks Making the fight against information disorders more effective

AB Public institutions, such as law enforcement agencies or health centers, have a vast volume of unstructured text documents, e.g. police reports. Currently, before this data can be shared (e.g. with research institutions), it must go through a lengthy and costly human anonymization procedure. This paper addresses this issue by presenting AGORA, a cutting-edge tool that automatically identifies key entities and anonymizes sensitive data in text documents. AGORA has been developed in partnership with the Spanish National Office Against Hate Crimes and validated in the police and medical domains. This tool allows to export both anonymized texts and identified entities to structured files, thus, simplifying its exploitation for analysis purposes. Also, AGORA is capable of plotting the location entities identified in the documents, as well as obtaining and displaying relevant information from their geographical surroundings. Thus, it simplifies the task of generating comprehensive datasets for subsequent data analysis or predictive tasks. Its main goal is to foster cooperation between public institutions and research centers by easing document sharing as well as serving as a foundation for addressing succeeding phases in data science. The paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of the literature on Named Entity Recognition methodologies and technologies. Followed by extensive computational experiments to identify the best configuration for the NER models embedded in AGORA which include both successful state-of-the-art model setups and novelly proposed ones. Finally, the methodology, conclusions and software provided can be easily reused in similar application scenarios.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The widespread use of plastic products worldwide generates an enormous amount of waste. Plastic is a substance that is not biodegradable and is permanent in the environment. The environment and living beings are negatively affected by this waste if it is not managed properly. However, the assessment and selection of effective plastic waste management methods is a complex and uncertain decision-making problem due to the involvement of multiple conflicting attributes, the imprecise human mind, and a lack of information. Recently, interval-valued spherical fuzzy (IVSF) sets have been recognized as one of the suitable tools to handle vague information. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid multi-attribute group decision-making methodology based on the entropy method, deviationbased method, and Multi-Attribute Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC) method with IVSF sets to choose the most effective plastic waste management process in which the decision experts' and attribute weights are completely unknown. In this model, the entropy and deviationbased methods are utilized to calculate the decision experts' and attribute weights, respectively. Also, the MABAC method is used to evaluate the priority order of the plastic waste management options. To do this, Dombi weighted averaging and Dombi weighted geometric operators are developed in the IVSF environment. In the proposed model, the Dombi weighted averaging operator is used to fuse several decision experts' information, and the Dombi weighted geometric operator is used to determine the border approximation area matrix. Then, to confirm the applicability of the suggested model, we look at a numerical example of choosing the most effective method for managing plastic waste with IVSF information. In the numerical example, we consider six alternatives and four important attributes with ten sub-attributes by consulting four decision experts. The result of this study shows that 'Recycling (A2)' is the most effective method to reduce plastic waste. Finally, we compare the proposed method with the existing ones to demonstrate its validity.

AB This paper presents a system for multi-label classification of text data processed in Call/Contact Centre (CC) systems. The solution presented herein constitutes a significant innovation and an advantage in relation to the solutions used so far in CC systems, as the contents can be automatically routed directly to even several agents with different competences (depending on the number of classes recognised in the message). The proposed approach combines a set of vectorisation methods, dimensionality reduction methods, and a classifier based on artificial neural networks. Analyses were performed using data from real databases of a large commercial CC system and data extracted from the publicly available Stackoverflow database to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed classification method. The proposed approach was compared with the existing text data classification methods. The method enables classification of text messages belonging to one or more classes and can be used to automatically route contents to agents with appropriate competences.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Index tracking is the problem of building a portfolio that replicates the performance of a market index. The recent applications involving deep learning in index tracking are more focused on the learned information rather than on the framework that consumes this information. The problem is that, until now, a way to enable the extension of the index tracking models that adopt machine learning was not yet proposed. Nowadays, the mathematical programming framework is more flexible when considering model extensions to build realistic portfolios. Thus, this study presents ways to combine generative adversarial networks (GANs) within this framework to generate market simulations incorporated into a base index tracking model. It was verified how the simulations generated by GANs can impact the out-of-sample performance of the portfolio and how to deal with their instability, by using real data from the Brazilian market. To achieve this, two evolutionary metaheuristics were proposed to solve the multiple scenario index tracking problem. The proposed evolutionary algorithms minimize the tracking errors of a portfolio in multiple market simulations generated by GANs. The performance of the proposed algorithms was compared against another evolutionary metaheuristic that solves the index tracking problem using historical data. It was possible to observe that the scenario-based dominance genetic algorithm (SDM-SBDGA-GAN) was able to perform better than the real data genetic algorithm (RDM-GA) and the sample average approximation genetic algorithm (SDM-SAAGA-GAN). These results open doors for new applications of synthetic data in the construction of portfolios using more realistic constraints and other tracking objectives. This work also brings discussions about problems related to the application of GANs in this context.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The data of target detection in remote sensing images are diverse, and the detection results of some categories with a small number of samples are poor. In order to solve this problem, most of the existing methods focus on the category with a small number of samples through data augmentation, but this will bring huge loss of original information, resulting in the decline of the effectiveness of some categories when improving the effectiveness. Additionally, since remote sensing image targets are small, numerous and densely distributed, the mixing degree of target and background is high, making them hardly distinguished. Therefore, a loss-based sample selection mechanism is proposed to enhance the category samples with low proportion. In the training process, we select between the original samples and enhanced samples through loss feedback, so as to retain the original sample information as much as possible and improve the detection performance. On this basis, an auxiliary feature detection module is proposed. First, the module detects the highly mixed area between the object to be detected and the background, and uses a series of image enhancement operations to build a genetic programming (GP) tree to separate the object from the background as much as possible, so that the detector can better extract and detect target features. Compared with other latest related algorithms, the loss-based sample selection mechanism and evolutionary auxiliary feature detection method proposed in this paper can improve the detection performance of low proportion categories through the sample selection mechanism, and improve the robustness to background clutter interference through evolutionary auxiliary feature detection. The proposed approach effectively improves the detection performance and performs well in remote sensing target detection.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB In this work two established methods were merged: Fourier Transform and Convolutional Neural Net-work to classify images in several datasets. Fourier Transform is commonly used in signal processing as well as in image processing. Convolutional Neural Networks are well-suited to image analysis tasks, yet require a lot of processing power and/or time during training process. Fourier Transform Layer is introduced to increase the processing speed without sacrificing accuracy. The motivation is to present and compare an alternative approach to Convolutional Neural Networks, which could reduce the need for GPU training. Models containing only the novel layer were trained to classify images from widely accepted datasets and compared to classification results of simple models containing one convolutional layer. The comparison was performed in terms of test accuracy, Area-Under-Curve and training times. The results showed that, for images of size 128 x 128 and larger, models with the proposed layer reached test accuracy comparable to that reached by convolutional models (accuracy: 96% and 98% respectively), with at least 27% decrease in training time per one epoch on Central Processing Unit.& COPY; 2023 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering PAS.

ID ROUGH SET; MAKING APPROACH
AB Forest fires are an abrupt and highly destructive meteorological disaster that can occur in all regions of the world, resulting in significant ecological, economic and social losses. Moreover, the causes of forest fire disasters are usually complex, involving several uncertain factors such as temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and rainfall. All of those pose the greatest challenge to the study of forest fire management (FRM). In order to efficiently explore FRM via valid intelligent decision-making techniques, a novel model of regret theory (RT)-based multi-granularity (MG) three-way decisions (TWD) in incomplete T-spherical fuzzy (T-SF) environments has been constructed, where incomplete T-spherical fuzzy sets (T-SFSs) have been employed to describe diverse types of uncertain information in FRM, and RT-based MG TWD is conducive to analyzing multi-source T-SF information via reducing decision risks and modeling bounded rationality owned by decision-makers (DMs). Specifically, the concept of MG T-SF incomplete information systems (IISs) has been first constructed for information depictions of FRM. Then, MG T-SF IISs have been processed via the presented T-SF similarity principles for developing adjustable MG T-SF probabilistic rough sets (PRSs). Afterwards, an RT-based MG TWD approach has been built with the support of adjustable MG T-SF PRSs. Finally, a real-world FRM case analysis has been performed by using the built RT-based MG TWD approach, and extensive comparative and experimental analyses have been performed to validate the practicability of the presented methodology. To sum up, the presented methodology has simultaneously incorporated MG T-SF IISs, MG TWD and RT to model various uncertainties, valid information fusion processes and bounded rationality for FRM, which serves as a valid intelligent decision-making technique in processing incomplete and imprecise multi-source information with plentiful decision risks and regret emotions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Metaheuristic algorithms are currently being studied in depth by many scholars, and it is an important task to improve the learning and adaptive capabilities of the algorithms so that they can be of great use in a wide range of optimization problems. The Manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) has made certain achievements in optimization problems, but it still has shortcomings, such as its insufficient intra-population communication and poor learning ability, so the optimization capability of MRFO needs further improvement. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes a manta ray foraging optimization based on mechanics game and progressive learning for multiple optimization problems, which is abbreviated as MGL-MRFO, introducing variable spiral factors and dynamic adjustment of internal parameters; then proposes progressive learning to enhance the learning ability of MRFO; and finally proposes a matching game-based update mechanism to eliminate intra-population repetition as a feasible solution. It is validated in terms of move step size and time complexity. The results are compared with variants of the algorithm proposed in recent years in 18 benchmark test functions and the CEC 2022 test set, as well as with the TOP algorithm in the CEC competition, and show that MGL-MRFO has strong advantages, validating the novelty and competitiveness of MGL-MRFO. At the end of the paper, the feasibility and practicality of MGL-MRFO is further validated by three engineering optimization problems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, several population-based evolutionary and swarm algorithms have been developed and used in the literature. This work introduces an improved Cultural Algorithm with a modified selection function and a dynamic & alpha;-cognition procedure to handle a variety of challenging numerical optimization problems. The modified selection function is used to support a balanced evolutionary search. A process that starts with a clearer exploration early in the search process and gradually begins to focus on exploitation towards the end of the search process. This work uses the elites of each knowledge source that are at a certain distance from each other. The dynamic & alpha;-cognition procedure assists in providing effective learning of individuals through preserving the diversity of the population during the evolution process. In this procedure, each individual is able to learn from the top & alpha;% individuals controlled by its knowledge source in the belief space, where the proportion of the affecting subpopulation (& alpha;) is adaptively modified during the evolution. The performance of the proposed work has been evaluated on the CEC'2010 and CEC'2013 benchmark suites developed for the special sessions on large-scale global optimization problems. An appropriate comparative study with the best results in the literature is presented. The results confirm how the merits of the improved Cultural Algorithm can achieve superior performance over other cutting-edge algorithms for these data sets. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work presents Apis-Prime,2a hybrid deep learning model for soft sensing and time series forecast-ing, to estimate the daily weight variations of honeybee hives. Apis-Prime improves the state-of-the-art of earlier proposed WE-Bee (Anwar et al., 2022), and also helps optimize the beehive monitoring systems for the task of daily weight variation estimation. Weight variations of a honeybee hive are the most important indicator of hive productivity, and the health and strength of a bee colony. Currently, precise measurement of the weight of a hive requires an expensive weighing scale under each hive. On the other hand, sensors deployed inside the hive are cheaper than a weighing scale, and are shielded from the extreme weather variations outside the hive. In this work, honeybee activity is monitored using data from sensors inside the hive, along with monitoring the information related to the seasons, time of the day, weather, and the size of the hive. Apis-Prime's deep learning algorithm is based on two self-attention encoders, which collectively transform the sensor data into daily weight variations of the hive. Two parallel encoders simultaneously pay attention to time-based relationships and feature-based relationships within the daily sensor data and generate daily hive weight estimates with better accuracy. The comparison shows an average error of 19.7 grams/frame for Apis-Prime, compared to 21.05 grams/frame for the earlier proposed model WE-Bee. For system optimization, this work uses the attention weights of trained encoders of Apis-Prime to evaluate the sensor features collected by the monitoring system. This evaluation is used to identify and remove the unnecessary sensors/features from the dataset, reducing the number of features from 36 to 23, hence providing a significant optimization of cost, power, and data bandwidth. We provide a performance analysis of beehive weight estimations by Apis-Prime using the complete, as well as the optimized dataset on 2,170 days of beehive sensor recordings. Equally good results of daily weight estimations using the optimized feature set demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model for the optimization of the beehive monitoring system for the task of hive weight estimation.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB As a widely used product improvement technique, the quality function deployment (QFD) can satisfy customer requirements and realize higher customer satisfaction by translating them into corresponding engineering characteristics. Nonetheless, two basic challenges hinder the effective application of QFD are the imprecise relationship assessments between customer requirements and engineering charac-teristics because of the uncertainty inherent in human judgements and the unreasonable importance ranking of engineering characteristics due to the heterogeneity of domain experts. In response, this paper puts forward a new hybrid QFD approach for the priority of engineering characteristics to satisfy customer requirements. First, multi-granular unbalanced linguistic term sets are utilized to describe the vague relational evaluations between customer requirements and engineering characteristics. Then, the opinion evolution social network consensus reaching model is employed to assist QFD experts in deriving consensual relational evaluations. Taking the conflict customer requirements into consideration, the combined compromise solution method is adopted and extended to derive the priority orders of engineering characteristics. To illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed QFD approach, a product development case about low pressure pulse filter is provided with comparative analysis and simulation experiments. The results show that the proposed approach can represent complex linguistic relationship assessments of experts and determine more accurate priority orders of engineering characteristics in QFD. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Decision-making under evacuation environment is extremely complex due to the variety of aspects to be considered as well as the necessity of high-speed reaction. Therefore, the elaboration of the evacuation pattern, particularly, finding the priority order of shelters for evacuation, requires multiple experts to be involved in the decision-making process. Moreover, decision-makers cannot provide precise assessments of alternatives due to the uncertainty inherent in the network parameters, dynamic nature of transportation, complexity of the task. In this regard, the method of finding the priority order of terminals for the evacuation based on the fuzzy hesitant TOPSIS method is proposed. The method handles a modified ranking index to find the priority order based on assigned weights of separations. In this method, experts' assessments are presented as linguistic terms, which are further converted to fuzzy triangular numbers. This leads to the hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS decision-making with completely unknown attribute weights. The existing state of the art of evacuation modeling lacks fuzzy statements of evacuation flow problems. Our work aims to contribute to the design of the algorithm for the lexicographic maximum flow finding in the evacuation dynamic network with fuzzy transit arc capacities and transit traversal time parameters with partial contraflow. The approach reverses only necessary arcs by reversing the traffic in vacant segments, which allows using these segments for movement towards the safe areas as well. In addition, the method based on linear combinations of spreads is proposed to handle fuzzy values, which does not lead to the blurring of a fuzzy number. A case study to find the priority order of four destinations d1, d2, d3, d4 along with the maximum dynamic flow determining is provided to illustrate the proposed method. The hesitant fuzzy TOPSIS evaluated the priority order of destinations for evacuation the maximum number of aggrieved as {d4, d3, d1, d2} along with maximum lexicographic flow with partial lane reversal & SIM;62 flow units. The method for finding the spreads without blurring a fuzzy number was used to determine the final triangular number (50, 62, 75) units. The sensitivity analysis shows that in all ten cases, the alternatives have unique rank: A4 is the best, A2 is the worst. In the pessimistic case, DMs prefers the alternative that is furthest to FNIS. In the optimistic case, DMs prefer the alternative that is closest to FPIS. We proved that the proposed algorithm is reliable because despite the changes in parameters & omega;, the same priority order of alternatives is chosen. The obtained results are confirmed by efficiency frontier and coincide with the results of original TOPSIS, Doukas et al.'s, method, Kuo's method, Yoon and Kim's behavioral TOPSIS. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Automated and intelligent design in the construction industry has drawn considerable attention in these years along with the modern industrial revolutions. However, the achievement is strongly held up by the high unreliability in the underground space. To ameliorate this situation, this study develops a fuzzy robust multi-objective optimization (FRMOO) ensembled generative design system based on a large-diameter tunnel construction project with existing tunnels lying above. The robust part of the algorithm focuses on dealing with the unavoidable uncertainties from geotechnical conditions by seeking more conservative solutions. The fuzzy logic transforms the objective from minimizing the damage to seeking the most satisfactory solution by balancing all requirements from objectives and constraints. From evaluating the improvement in safety and the designer's satisfaction degree simultaneously, the FRMOO approach reaches an overall improvement of 29.15%, which is found significantly superior to merely using robust optimization (18.93%) or simply using deterministic optimization (19.13%). Besides the FRMOO segment, the generative design system is also ensembled with a parametric modeling segment, which automatically builds a model based on the optimal solutions, and a user interface for the designer to interact with.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates the problem of cooperative guidance of two pursuers against an evader equipped with higher maneuverability. The goal is that the distance between the Evader and at least one of the pursuers becomes less than a predetermined threshold at the end of flight time. To achieve this goal, firstly, the roles of pursuers are divided into two units, which include (1) pursuing the Evader and (2) Observing the Evader's escape space. Secondly, a new cooperative guidance algorithm based on the separation of roles of the pursuers is proposed and formulated into a constrained nonlinear model predictive control problem. An objective function with time-variant weighting factors is presented to evaluate the constrained guidance commands. The proposed guidance algorithm uses a gray wolf-based optimization algorithm to calculate the guidance commands. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carrying out emergency rescue in coordination with multiple organizations, is of great significance for the effectiveness and timeliness of emergency response. Therefore, this study aims to extend a novel practical tool for distinguishing the optimal combination of different emergency plans in multiple organizations. In a multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic term sets (MGEPLTSs) environment, we propose a new collaborative emergency decision-making (CEDM) approach in the inspiration of the best-worst method (BWM) and TOmada de Decisao Iterativa Multicriterio (TODIM) method. Firstly, a combined multi-granularity and extended probabilistic linguistic term sets, namely MGEPLTSs, are proposed to quantify the preferences given by decision makers (DMs) to address the issues on potential ambiguity and uncertainty in actual CEDM. Then, the BWM is introduced to the MGEPLTSs environment to compute the index weights of the individual and collaborative performance evaluation for multi-plan combinations, by building the fuzzy mathematical programming model respectively. Finally, we develop the multi-granularity extended probabilistic linguistic TODIM method to calculate the overall dominance of indexes considering the psychological behavior of DMs, thereby achieving the ranking of multi-plan combinations. A CEDM case on COVID-19 epidemic is used to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, and the sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis with other similar approaches are presented to demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Recently, traditional fault diagnosis methods achieve fault identification by establishing a sample set covering all fault degrees of different fault components in complex systems. However, the uncertainties including environmental stresses and own physical and chemical variations lead to an infinite number of fault degrees of fault components, and the fault identification of complex systems in practical engineering applications faces the challenge of fluctuating operating conditions due to variations of rotational speed and load. To address the above problem, a fault location method based on ensemble complex spatio-temporal attention network (ECSAN) is proposed in this paper, which can identify the critical fault components of complex systems by combining an ensemble learning mechanism with excellent basic estimators. A basic estimator consists of a feature extraction module, a feature enhancement module, and a classification module. In the first module, a complex spatio-temporal backbone network with strong generalization is developed to provide spatio-temporal features containing the inherent information of the sample data for complex systems. In the feature enhancement module, a lightweight complex attention layer is constructed to enhance the effective structural information of the features and reduce the interference of their redundant information. The classification module then adopts a Softmax layer to perform fault classification. Finally, an ensemble learning mechanism is designed to integrate the basic estimators. By constructing sample weights and introducing a knowledge transfer strategy, the generalization is further improved while saving training expenses. Two datasets from different experimental platforms are concerned to verify the effectiveness and superiority of this method under various operating conditions and fault degrees. The experimental results indicate that this method achieves 99.81% accuracy on a standard dataset of the mechanical system and 98.88% accuracy on a real dataset of the closed-loop control system of the water jet propulsion device, which is superior to comparison approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Predicting long-term stock index prices is a challenging and debatable task. Most of the studies focus on predicting next-day stock prices. However, those are not useful to long-term investors and traders. In this paper, we attempt to predict up to a year's daily prices of global stock indices using daily close prices data. This study fills a gap in the existing literature by focusing on long-term stock index price forecasting, which is crucial for practical applications in the financial markets. Moreover, The empirical analysis highlights the superior performance of a rolling forward-validation approach over cross validation in predicting long-term stock prices. A forward-validating Genetic Algorithm Optimization for Support Vector Regression (OGA-SVR) is used to efficiently forecast multi-step ahead long-term global stock indices. Further, the performance of the model is compared with that of Support Vector Regression (SVR), Grid Search based Support Vector Regression (GS-SVR), Genetic algorithm-based Support Vector regression (GA-SVM), and state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithms. The models are empirically tested on five global stock indices time series daily data, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), DAX performance index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (NI225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index (SSE). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used for the evaluation The result shows the OGA-SVR model outperforms other models in predicting the long-term prices of global indices. Further, the OGA-SVR model has the potential to forecast the long-term underlying future pattern of index prices which can be used to build trading and risk mitigation systems by investors and traders.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper addresses the problem of efficient automation system configuration for mass customization in industrial manufacturing. Due to the various demands from customers, production lines need to adjust the process parameters of the machines based on specific quality parameters. Reinforcement learning, which learns from samples, can tackle the problem more efficiently than the currently used methods. Based on the proximal policy optimization and centralized training with decentralized execution, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method (MARL) is proposed to reconfigure process parameters of machines based on the changed specifications. The proposed method has the actor of each agent observing only its own state, the agents are made to collaborate by a centralized critic which observes all the states. To evaluate the method, a steel strip rolling line with six collaborating mills is studied. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning methods in terms of accuracy and computing costs.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Air quality prediction is a crucial issue in air pollution control and plays a vital role in environmental preservation and the promotion of sustainable development. A novel air quality prediction framework, referred to as Correlation-split and Recombination-sort Interaction Networks (CRINet), is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the data is divided into smaller segments based on the Correlation-split strategy, and is followed by a convolution operation to enhance the capability of extracting essential features. Secondly, Recombination-sort strategy is used to facilitate the interaction between temporal features. The CRINet model utilizes a dual-layer CRINet network structure to extract internal dependencies and temporal features from air quality data for prediction. Finally, the Beijing PM2.5 dataset and the Beijing Shunyi-station Air Quality dataset are used for experimental evaluation. The outcomes demonstrate that the CRINet model surpasses other models in prediction accuracy, particularly in the prediction of multiple pollutant concentrations. This provides theoretical and methodological support for accurately assessing air quality and formulating treatment strategies for relevant departments. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Reducing the risk of landslide hazards necessitates a prompt emergency decision regarding landslides, particularly when a hasty investigation lacks abundant data. Thus, the experience and opinions of experts, which are typically expressed in linguistic terms rather than exact values, can be utilized to the fullest extent to facilitate this process. Here I extend the gained and lost dominance score (GLDS) method to a generalized linguistic setting for modeling collective cognition in the selection of landslide treatment schemes for an open-pit mine. To do so, a generalized qualitative scale considering two cognitive bias arguments and one granularity parameter of linguistic term sets (LTS), which constitutes a generalized LTS that allows experts to express their evaluations in a flexible way, is presented to capture precise semantics of linguistic evaluations. Furthermore, several aggregation operators are given to deal with the generalized LTS for information fusion. To promote the application of the GLDS method within the context of multi-expert heterogeneous linguistic environment, I develop the framework of a generalized GLDS method by improving three aspects (i.e., the construction of dominance flow, the computing of lost dominance scores and the establishment of final aggregation function) of the classical one. Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed method is examined by solving the multiple criteria decision-making problem we encountered as well as comparing with other outranking methods. The lattice anchored technique coupled with real-time monitoring is picked out to treat the landslide, which mitigates the production pressure in this high-slope open-pit mine.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   metric; Transfer learning
AB Defect detection is crucial in the quality control of industrial applications. Existing supervised methods are heavily reliant on the large amounts of labeled data. However, labeled data in some specific fields are still scarce, and it requires professionals to do expensive manual annotations. In this paper, we construct a novel self-supervised steel surface defect detection model by learning better embedding feature representation of the defect on large amounts of unlabeled data, which can achieve excellent results in downstream detection tasks. Commonly used image embeddings strategies in self-supervised contrastive learning methods destroy the spatial structures of the image and are not suitable for pre-training of object detection. To address the aforementioned issue, we preserve convolutional feature maps to mine robust data structures and local features, which can enhance the representation capability of the upstream model and make it applicable for transfer to object detection tasks. Besides, in order to eliminate the effect of random augmentations of contrastive learning, which can introduce noise on multi-target coexistence datasets, the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) metric is employed to evaluate the contrastive matching similarity. Finally, a Self-supervised Contrastive Representation Learning framework with EMD (SCRL-EMD) is constructed through learning on large-scale unlabeled data and then transferred to Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet for detection performance validation on two public steel defect datasets. Comparative experimental results show that our method can achieve superior results than the state-of-the-art approaches. Compared to the baseline model, it achieves 4.1% and 6.8% mAP improvement on the two datasets, respectively. More importantly, a further improvement can be achieved on a smaller downstream dataset, revealing the meaningful potential of our method in exploiting more readily available unlabeled data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Gas-expensive patterns detection to optimize smart contracts

DT Article
DE Smart contract; Code optimization; Expensive Operation; Pre-trained
   model
AB Smart contracts are programmable protocols that run on Ethereum and require gas to be deployed and used. Gas-expensive operations in some smart contracts can cause users to consume extra gas in transactions. There are already several methods to detect gas-expensive patterns in smart contracts. However, some problems still need to be solved: most static analysis methods are based on specialist knowledge, and the patterns used to detect gas-expensive patterns must be manually summarized before the detection methods can be applied. Furthermore, due to the explosive growth of smart contracts, which generate a large amount of data, it is challenging to reuse these methods across different patterns. To address these issues, this work first proposes a new learning-based method, ExpenGas, based on the idea of evolutionary computation-based machine learning to detect Expensive Operation patterns of smart contracts through pre-trained techniques and multi-crucial data flow graphs. The low complexity of the multi-crucial data flow graph enables the model to focus on key features. Finally, by testing on 21981 smart contract files, ExpenGas has 83.05% accuracy and 91.96% recall in detecting the Expensive Operation patterns of gas-expensive patterns, which is significantly more optimal than the current state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As an important expanded quantification fuzzy rough set model, the local fuzzy rough set model is used to measure relative quantitative information between the fuzzy similarity classes and the basic concept. Although many studies have taken on this topic, the existing local fuzzy rough sets ignore the absolute quantitative information in the fuzzy information system over two universes. Therefore, based on this observation, we propose a local double quantitative fuzzy rough set model over two universes, which considers the problems from the double quantization form of the local fuzzy rough sets over two universes. Furthermore, the corresponding properties and decision rules of the local double quantitative "logical and"fuzzy rough set model over two universes are studied. Then, in order to improve the applicability of the model, an effective reduction method is introduced. Finally, we conduct experimental comparisons showing the computational efficiency and approximate accuracy of the model in concept approximation and reduction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Efficient and stable global optimizers constitute a noteworthy arena of academic study and real-world applications. Since Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm inspired by the quantum motion for solving optimization problems was proposed, considerable contributions regarding this algorithm have been achieved in recent years. Nevertheless, issues such as the aggregation effect during sampling as well as recurrence and blindness in random searches hinder the performance of the algorithm. Motivated by this situation, a variant of Multi-scale Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Algorithm is put forward to improve the efficiency of the system convergence while maintaining the solution diversity. The measurement of the solution position through the collapse of the quantum state to the classical state is realized by means of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and the energy position is established as a metric for energy observation. Then, the adaptive correction of the energy position is explored to improve algorithm performance. The core idea of our mechanism is to adaptively guide the candidate solutions toward convergence to the ground state by means of attractive factors based on the relationship among the energy positions of several reference points. Experimental results obtained on the CEC2013 benchmark functions and a real-world application indicate that the performance of our scheme is competitive and that it achieves prominence among the compared algorithms as the dimensionality increases.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The Bitcoin market is firmly positioned as a global asset market. However, due to its extremely high volatility and the lack of a custom Bitcoin trading system, investors find it difficult to establish an effective investment strategy in this market. In this study, we build an intelligent Bitcoin trading system to maximize profitability by predicting the market. We propose a fusion approach combining technology with economic knowledge to achieve accurate predictions. Firstly, we provide an ensemble prediction framework that integrates the AdaBoost algorithm with the LSTM deep learning model as a form of technological convergence. This dramatically improves the predictive performance due to the high representational capacity of LSTM and the overfitting minimization capability of AdaBoost. Secondly, to account for the repeated structural volatility in the market, we combine the econometrics Markov regime-switching model with the AdaBoost-LSTM model to predict the period of market turbulence caused by structural breaks in the regime. Our prediction model suggests that market turbulence lasting longer than 21 days could be a potentially high-risk investment in the future. Finally, we have developed a Bitcoin-customized trading algorithm that maximizes rewards by predicting upward movements in prices and warning of high-risk investments during a long-lasting turbulent regime. In trading tests, our system yielded a cumulative return of 2.4 times and 4.0 times on 1day and 5-day forecasts, respectively, compared to other representative trading strategies such as the stochastic oscillator.

AB As an evolutionary algorithm for automatic generation of computer programs, Gene expression programming (GEP) has received a lot of attention because it can generate concise and highly accurate solutions. However, GEP also has some unsatisfactory aspects, such as too many control parameters and a lack of balance between exploration and exploitation. Therefore, a new GEP with dual strategies and neighborhood search (DNSGEP) is proposed in this paper for symbolic regression problems. As the core part, a new multi-parent crossover operator with neighborhood search is proposed to replace the original transposition and recombination operators in GEP, which greatly reduces the excessive control parameters in GEP. To assist the multi-parent crossover operator in selecting parents, selection weight is used to assess the quality of individuals in the population. The multi-parent crossover operator combines selection weight to learn more from the better parents. In order to satisfy the different needs of global search and local search of the algorithm, two different crossover strategies are extended on the basis of the multi-parent crossover operator. Furthermore, a population distribution entropy strategy to GEP is proposed for determining when the algorithm should choose which crossover strategy to use. DNSGEP is compared with GEP and three GEP variants on 14 symbolic regression problems and 6 even parity problems. Experimental results show that DNSGEP has the success rate and accuracy that are fully superior to GEP, GEPADF and OGEP, not inferior to SLGEP.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Diophantine equations are equations containing two or more unknowns, such that only the integer solutions are required. To find solutions of these equations numerically, we can be performed by solving an optimization problem using a metaheuristic method. In this paper, the Spiral Optimization Algorithm with Clustering (SOAC) method is proposed to find solutions to Diophantine equations in the form of polynomial, exponential, and also linear and nonlinear systems of equations. In the implementation of the method on solving some existing benchmark problems, the goal of simulation is to find all solutions only in a single run and in a short period of time. Appropriate values of required parameters are selected during the simulation. Results shows satisfactory in solving four problems in polynomial equations, four problems in exponential equations, and three problems in systems of linear and nonlinear equations. In most of cases, the results yield the same with the analytical or numerical solutions in the reference papers, and in some cases the results give more solutions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The selection of a mission architecture is complex due to conflicting and intertwined mission operation criteria. In addition, the uncertainties inherent in human exploration missions make the evaluation process more challenging. This study presents a combination of improved fuzzy preference program-ming (FPP) and weighted influence non-linear gauge system (WINGS) to efficiently and effectively weigh conflicting and intertwined decision criteria and prioritize mission architecture scenarios at NASA. The improved FPP determines the weights of decision criteria, and the WINGS method considers criteria interdependencies and evaluates the alternative mission architecture scenarios. A numerical example demonstrates the proposed approach's performance compared to three multi -criteria methods. A case study at the Johnson Space Center shows the applicability and efficacy of the proposed approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Metaverse integrates a variety of digital technologies, which can significantly reduce production costs, improve product quality and consumer experience, and has become an important direction of digital transformation of manufacturing industry. However, manufacturing enterprises need to bear too high costs and risks to develop metaverse, which hinders the development of metaverse in manufacturing industry. Therefore, on the perspective of supply chain, this study establishes the evolutionary game system in which the manufacturer, the retailer and the government participate in the development of metaverse, so as to analyze the conditions of strategy selection and system equilibrium of all parties, and uses MATLAB R2021b to conduct numerical simulation to analyze the influence of various factors on system equilibrium. Results indicate a positive correlation between the willingness of manufacturer and retailer to participate, and when both sides tend to participate in the development of metaverse, the government will also adopt subsidy strategy; The promotion degree of metaverse to product attributes will positively affect the willingness of all parties to participate; The participation of retailers positively affects the willingness of manufacturer to develop metaverse; The price sensitivity of consumers to product prices is negatively correlated with the willingness of manufacturer and retailer to participate. The incentive effect of government subsidies positively affects the willingness of the three parties to participate. Finally, this paper provides suggestions for all participants on how to strengthen the cooperative relationship so as to give full play to the functions of metaverse.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The early detection of malignant lung nodules can strongly increase the chances of life in lung cancer patients. A computer tomography scan represents an effective way to identify and locate malignant nodules in the body and monitor their growth. However, the reading and interpretation of tomography scans are subject to errors that can be reduced with a second reader. The adoption of image processing systems can reduce the possibility of errors and can support radiologists in ensuring multiple readings of tomography scans. This study proposes a new approach for accurate 3D lung nodule detection starting from computer tomography scans. This work exploits an evolutionary algorithm to build variants of a UNet-based architecture, called GUNet3++, to detect patients affected by lung cancer, from the analysis of CT-scan images of lungs. The approach is validated on the LIDC-IDRI real dataset and results show that it improves segmentation quality metrics (IoU and Dice) over baselines, leading to better 3D models reconstruction of lesions. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Compiling quantum circuits on target quantum hardware architectures is one of the key issues in the development of quantum algorithms, and the related problem is known as the Quantum Circuit Compilation Problem (QCCP). This paper presents a genetic algorithm for solving QCCP instances for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms (QAOA). In particular, such instances represent quantum circuits for the resolution of both MaxCut and Graph-Coloring combinatorial problems. The presented algorithm represents a significant improvement over an already existing genetic algorithm called Decomposition Based Genetic Algorithm (DBGA), and is characterized by a completely new coding scheme that allows to reduce the number of SWAP gates introduced in the decoding step, consequently reducing the circuit depth. After providing a description of the problem, this paper presents the newly produced genetic algorithm (termed DBGA-X) in detail, especially focusing on the new coding/decoding scheme. Subsequently, a set of results will be presented that demonstrate the superior performance of the new method compared with the results obtained from recent literature against the same benchmark. In addition, new benchmarks characterized by larger quantum architectures and by a higher number of compilation passes are proposed in this paper, to the aim of testing the scalability of the proposed method in more realistic scenarios.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

DT Article
DE Stacked regression; LightGBM; k-nearest neighbors; PM2.5
AB Over the past few years, stacked generalization has emerged as a promising approach for predicting the concentration of PM2.5, but its use is often associated with reduced efficiency due to computational demands. In this study, we propose a new approach called Reduced Bayesian Optimized Stacked Regressor (RBOSR) that optimizes both the performance and efficiency of the PM2.5 stacked model. RBOSR incorporates Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, ensemble-based feature selection, dimensionality reduction via single-link hierarchical clustering, and recursive base estimator eliminations. Results: The RBOSR model is significantly more efficient when compared to the original stacked model, with 5.7 times shorter training time. Additionally, the RBOSR model outperformed the unreduced stacked model with an R2 value of 0.91 and RMSE of 26.46, resulting in a 3.5% improvement. Compared to other PM2.5 stacked models proposed in recent studies, the RBOSR model demonstrates superior efficiency, with up to 47 times shorter training time. While the RBOSR approach has been developed specifically for PM2.5 prediction, it has the potential for broader applications in other regression problems. Although the approach has not yet been applied to other datasets, future work could explore its applicability to a broader range of datasets and the development of more efficient strategies for optimizing base estimator selection.

AB Industrial cut tobacco drying is one of the most important processes in cigarette production, which affects the taste, cut tobacco consumption and other indicators of cigarette products. Due to the complicated process and parameters involved, the production of drying system is difficult to improve. In this paper, the model of tobacco drying system is established and optimized. First, an eighthorder nonlinear first-principle model is established, and its corresponding constrained multi-objective optimization problem is constructed based on the multiple requirements in industrial production. Furthermore, an adaptive dual-population based evolutionary algorithm (ADPEA) is proposed in which an assistant population is introduced to balance the feasibility, diversity and convergence. Feasible solutions are preferentially reserved to the next generation in the main population, while diversity and convergence are considered more in the assistant population. The ADPEA is used to optimize the tobacco drying system and is compared with four state-of-the-art multi-objective evolution algorithms. The experimental results reveal that ADPEA has a better performance, and the optimization results could help engineers adjust the process parameters according to the requirements of different batches and brands of cigarette products to ensure that the whole production process can meet the technological requirements while saving energy and reducing emissions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate prediction of floating offshore platform motion (FOPM) is very important to control the movement of the platform and the normal operation of the equipment on the platform. However, the accurate prediction of FOPM is very difficult, due to the coupling effect of the mooring system, operation system, wind, wave, and current. Therefore, in order to obtain more accurate prediction results, firstly, the Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) network is introduced to simulate FOPM nonlinear dynamical system, design input vector coding rules, considering the characteristics of complex time-varying nonlinear and space non-stationary of FOPM. The EEMD is applied for modal decomposition for time series of FOPM to reduce the nonlinearity of time series. Then the FOPM-EEMD-ConvLSTM forecasting model is proposed by designing the input sequence matrix and prediction architecture. Considering the defects of ALO algorithm, based on quantum computing and chaotic mapping, the quantum global search algorithm (QRS) and ant lion trap Chaos reconstruction mechanism (ALTCR)are designed, and chaotic quantum ant lion optimization algorithm (CQALO) is proposed and use to optimate the hyperparametric of FOPM-EEMD-ConvLSTM. Consequently, a hybrid forecasting approach of FOPM integrating FOPM-EEMD-ConvLSTM and CQALO was established, namely FOPM-EEMD-ConvLSTM-CQALO. Finally, the sway and heave data of a floating offshore platform serving in the ocean is used to carry out prediction experiments to test the performance of the proposed new prediction approach. The test results indicate that the prediction model established in this paper has higher prediction accuracy and stronger robustness than the comparison model selected in this paper and the CQALO obtains more appropriate hyperparameters than the comparison algorithm applied in selecting the hyperparameters of FOPM-EEMD-ConvLSTM. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB An urban pluvial flood is a devastating, costly natural disaster requiring effective rescue path planning to mitigate the loss of lives and property. The inherent uncertainty and complexity of the risks associated with urban flooding limit the ability to plan optimal rescue paths that prioritize both timeliness and safety. This study addresses the challenge by proposing an innovative assessment methodology to output risk values and probability representing safety and timeliness in each passable area while simulating real-world flood scenarios. Furthermore, the paper develops a pioneering path-planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning, incorporating improved stochastic reward exploitation and heterogeneous reward exploration mechanisms to function in a simulation rescue path-planning scenario with uncertainty and complexity. According to the findings, the proposed algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms in converging to the optimal path, fully sampling, and running efficiency. The study contributes to theoretical progress on urban pluvial flood rescue, deep reinforcement learning, risk assessment, and decision intelligence while offering practical implications for smart cities, emergency management, and optimizing real-world problems by employing artificial intelligence.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID INVERTERS
AB (2N+1) selective harmonic elimination pulse with modulation (SHE-PWM) is an important technique for a modular multi-level converter (MMC) to enhance the control ability and improve the fundamental wave amplitude accuracy of the output waveform. While finding optimal switch angles by solving the complex non-linear equation system is one of its main challenges. A current popular solution is to run a metaheuristic or evolutionary algorithm repeatedly on various modulation indexes. These methods ignore the fact that some of the optimization tasks are similar, and the optimization experiences could be shared among these similar tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes an evolutionary manytasking approach with prior knowledge (EMT-PK). EMT-PK facilitates positive knowledge transfer between similar tasks and is capable to solve all the sub SHE-PWM problems simultaneously through a single run. Numerical results on 7-, 9- and 11-level MMCs show that EMT-PK provides superior results for the (2N+1) SHE-PWM in comparison with 8 other widely used metaheuristics/evolutionary algorithms in this field including differential evolution (DE), ant colony optimization (ACO), teaching and learning-based optimization (TLBO), bee algorithm (BA), genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), generalized pattern search (GPS) and asynchronous particle swarm optimizationgenetic algorithm(APSO-GA). The superior performance of EMT-PK is further validated by the MATLAB Simulink simulation and the laboratory experiment on a 7-level MMC.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGY; ALGORITHM
AB Differential Evolution (DE) is a potent population-based global optimization algorithm which has already proven efficient for optimization demands in engineering applications. However, even the state-of-the-art DE variants still suffer premature convergence and lack of diversity. In order to overcome the above mentioned weaknesses, this paper proposes a brand-new DE variant, namely zDE algorithm, for single-objective numerical optimization. The main contributions can be summarized as follows: First, an improved wavelet basis function is incorporated into the generation of the scale factor F and a Minkowski Distance based adaptation scheme is proposed for the adaptation of it. Second, a new trial vector generation strategy is first proposed as a supplementary of the existing strategies, and t-distribution is incorporated into this strategy. Third, a novel diversity enhancement technique is firstly proposed by changing the dimensional parameters of the individuals in the population. The zDE algorithm is validated under 88 benchmarks from the CEC2013, CEC2014, and CEC2017 test suites for real-parameter single-objective optimization, and the results show the superiority of our algorithm in comparison with the recent state-of-the-art DE variants.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOO) are used to obtain the best compromising solutions when two or more objective functions need to be optimized simultaneously. The convergence and diversity are critical factors to consider while solving the MOO problems because they determine the possibility of obtaining an evenly distributed Pareto front. This paper proposes a hybrid optimization algorithm to solve a multi-objective economic emission dispatch (MOEED) problem of electrical power systems. The electrical power generated by consuming fossil fuels is very costly and also burning of these fuels contributes to global warming. Hence, electrical power is generated at the least cost and emission. The MOEED problems have been solved in the past by using swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms. However, the solutions reported in the literature, are either inferior or the constraints are violated. The algorithm proposed in this paper is an integration of an Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm and a Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to three test systems having 6, 10, and 40 coalbased generators. Additionally, various multi-criteria decision-making algorithms are used to identify the best non-dominated solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm and compared with previously reported results. The best fuel costs obtained by the proposed approach, for a 6-unit test system with and without transmission losses are found to be 605.9983 and 600.11140 $/h respectively. While the best emission values, for this test system, with and without transmission losses are found to be 0.1941 and 0.1942 tons/h. Moreover, the best fuel costs obtained by the proposed approach, for 10 and 40-unit test systems are found to be 111181.9871 and 121369.0838 $/h respectively. Furthermore, the best emission values for these test systems are found to be 3932.24322 and 176682.264 tons/h respectively. All these results are obtained without constraint violations and within 10-600 iterations. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Early intervention and prevention of chronic diseases is a fundamental way to reduce disease incidence. Due to the complex pathogenic factors of disease, the assessment of disease risk requires consideration of the influence of multiple factors. In clinical practice, disease risk assessment may face data with multi-source, multi-type and multiple indicators of examination items. Mining useful information and rules in this complex information is the foundation for further decisions. However, the existing knowledge representation methods cannot comprehensively and accurately describe these characteristic of data. Therefore, we introduce the concept of multiple hybrid attribute information systems (MHAISs). Then, we defined the binary relations over MHAIS by fusing different types of kernel functions. On this basis, we construct a variable precision multigranulation kernel rough set (VPMGKRS), and propose a multigranulation three-way decision method over MHAIS. In addition, considering the individual difference between decision objects and the diversity of data characteristic among sources, we calculate the loss functions under different granular with the help of conditional probabilities, and then obtain the thresholds for the three-way decisions. Finally, we use 712 clinical random samples to conduct a simulation analysis applying the proposed method to assess the risk of hypertension. The experiment result confirmed the applicability and validity of the model. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Product quality monitoring is one of the most critical demands in the coal industry. Conventional coal quality analysis is offline, laborious, and lagging behind coal production. Using machine vision for determining ash content in coal has been recently developed. However, there are some challenges in the model design due to its task complexity. A data augmentation method for a specific task was proposed to deal with the peculiarities of a small, unbalanced industrial dataset. For estimating ash content in coal from an image without background, we provided a trajectory going from a ResNet to an LKDPNet under the guidance of receptive field size. First, the model depth was determined by changing the stage ratio. Second, patch embedding was employed to substitute the stem cell of ResNet for downsampling. Third, a residual connection block of depthwise convolution followed by pointwise convolution was designed to replace the ResNet identify and conv blocks. The receptive field of the model was adjusted by increasing the kernel size of the depthwise convolution layer and removing the downsampling block. The results and visualization revealed that the proposed LKDPNet could significantly improve performance with an accuracy of 98.91% and an MAE of 0.082. It could pave the way to an online analysis of coal, thus accelerating intelligent coal production.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In response to the low-carbon development strategy, the new energy vehicle has become one crucial and recognized tool to satisfy the emission reduction requirements, the representative advance of the new energy vehicle is its intelligent drive technique. This paper introduces the driver's subjective guidance to further improve the intelligent drive technique. To do this, the hesitant convolutional neural networks (HCNN) are proposed to deal with the above issue, in which the hesitant fuzzy set is used to fully describe the subjective guidance information. Thus, the different driver's personalized needs can be considered and fused into the intelligent drive algorithm to achieve the intelligent drive technique of new energy vehicles. Note that the innovation and difference of the proposed method are the subjective guidance fusion and its generalized presentation but not the intelligent drive calculation. After that, the data downward partition model and weight secondary matching calculation are developed based on the HCNN to fully describe and process the hesitant fuzzy subjective guidance information. Furthermore, the intelligent drive algorithm considering the driver's subjective guidance is provided according to the above methods. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the given drive scenario. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a weakly supervised approach for group activity recognition by exploiting the local relative motion and global correlations among entities. Most existing approaches of group recognition characterize motions of group activities based on the coordinates of individuals or feature maps without excluding the camera motion, which is a combination of local relative motion and camera motion. To address this problem, we utilize a simple but effective Local Relative Motion Module (LRMM): a 3D-CNN-based network to exploit the local movement. We further employ a Global Correlation Module (GCM) to establish relationships among different feature patches for capturing the entire scene. We have evaluated the proposed method on sports and group activity video. The method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on three challenging datasets for weakly supervised group activity recognition. The method has also outperformed some approaches trained with much stronger supervision in the comparative evaluation.

AB Haze causes visual degradation and obscures image information, which gravely affects the reliability of computer vision tasks in real-time systems. Leveraging an enormous number of learning parameters as the restoration costs, learning-based methods have gained significant success, but they are runtime in-tensive or memory inefficient. In this paper, we propose a local multi-scale feature aggregation network, called LMFA-Net, which has a lightweight model structure and can be used for real-time dehazing. By learning the local mapping relationship between the clean value of a haze image at a certain point and its surrounding local region, LMFA-Net can directly restore the final haze-free image. In particular, we adopt a novel multi-scale feature extraction sub-network (M-Net) to extract features from different scales. As a lightweight network, LMFA-Net can achieve fast and efficient dehazing. Extensive experiments demon-strate that our proposed LMFA-Net surpasses previous state-of-the-art lightweight dehazing methods in both quantitatively and qualitatively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID INFORMATION
AB In this work, we study the multi-view partial label learning (MVPLL) problem, where each instance is depicted by different view features and associated with a set of candidate labels, among which a true label exists but is inaccessible in the training phase. Most existing PLL methods only consider single view case, which learn view classifier independently and neglect the view correlations, thus can not be applied to solve MVPLL problem. Due to the non-deep framework, traditional MVPLL approach is weak in the representation ability, so its performance is still to be improved. To solve the MVPLL problem, a deep multi-view prototype-based disambiguation approach is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we innovatively employ the deep neural network for multi-view ambiguously-labeled image classification to enhance the representation ability, which makes use of the information fusion between multiple views. To improve the discriminative ability, we propose multi-view prototype-based label disambiguation algorithm. On theoretical aspect, an estimation error bound for view-risk estimator is established, which is shown to be larger than that for fuse-risk estimator. Experiments demonstrate the superiorities of our proposed method in terms of the prediction accuracy. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The long-tailed data distribution is prevalent in real world and it poses great challenge on deep neural network training. In this paper, we propose Margin-aware Rectified Augmentation (MRA) to tackle this problem. Specifically, the MRA consists of two parts. From the data perspective, we analyze that data imbalance will cause the decision boundary be biased, and we propose a novel Margin-aware Rectified mixup (MR-mixup) that adaptively rectifies the biased decision boundary. Furthermore, from the model perspective, we analyze that the imbalance will also lead to consistent 'gradient suppression' on minority class logits. Then we propose Reweighted Mutual Learning (RML) that provides extra 'soft target' as su-pervision signal and augments the 'encouraging gradients' on the minority classes. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT and iNaturalist18. The results demonstrate that the proposed MRA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also yields a better-calibrated prediction.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Bimanual grabbing and tossing of packages onto trays or conveyor belts remains a human activity in the industry. For robots, such a dynamic task requires coordination between two arms and fast adaptation abilities when the tossing target is moving and subject to perturbations. Thus, this paper proposes a control framework that enables a bimanual robotic system to grab and toss objects onto a moving target. We develop a mixed learning-optimization method that computes the tossing parameters necessary to achieve accurate tossing tasks. Hence, we learn an inverse throwing map (a closed-form solution of the inverse non-linear throwing problem) that provides minimum release velocities of the object for given relative release positions. This map is embedded into a kinematicsbased bi-level optimization that determines the associated feasible release states (positions and velocities) of the dual-arm robot. Additionally, we propose a closed-form modeling approach of the robot's tossable workspace (set of all positions reachable by an object if tossed by the robot) and use the model to predict intercept or landing locations that yield high probabilities of task success. Furthermore, we employ dynamical systems to generate the coordinated motion of the dual-arm system and design an adaptation strategy to ensure robustness of the interception in the face of target's perturbations in speed or location. Finally, we validate experimentally the framework on two 7-DoF robotic arms. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach. We also show its speed and energy advantages when compared to the traditional pick-and-place strategy. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep reinforcement learning, by taking advantage of neural networks, has made great strides in the continuous control of robots. However, in scenarios where multiple robots are required to collaborate with each other to accomplish a task, it is still challenging to build an efficient and scalable multi-agent control system due to increasing complexity. In this paper, we regard each unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with its manipulator as one agent, and leverage the power of multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) for the cooperative navigation and manipulation of a load. We propose solutions for addressing navigation to grasping point problem in targeted and flexible scenarios, and mainly focus on how to develop model-free policies for the UAVs without relying on a trajectory planner. To overcome the challenges of learning in scenarios with an increasing number of grasping points, we incorporate the demonstrations from an Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm into our framework to guide the policy training and adapt two novel techniques into the architecture of MADDPG. Furthermore, curriculum learning with the attention mechanism is utilized by reusing knowledge from fewer grasping points to facilitate the training of a load with more points. Our experiments were validated by a load with three, four and six grasping points respectively in Coppeliasim simulator and then transferred into the real world with Crazyflie quadrotors. Our results show that the average tracking deviations from the desirable grasping point to the final position of the UAV can be less than 10 cm in some real-world experiments. Compared with state -of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning and swarm optimization algorithms, results show that our proposed methods outperform other baselines with a reasonable success rate especially in the scenarios with more grasping points. Furthermore, the learned optimal policies enable UAVs to reach and hover over all the grasping points before manipulation without any collision. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of both targeted and flexible navigation, highlighting their respective advantages and disadvantages.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Both graph neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN) perform well in predicting the trading signals of time series data. However, these models often encounter challenges in profitability due to either inadequate information or algorithmic limitations. A model AG-MCNN is proposed by combining ameliorated graph sample and aggregate network (GraphSAGE) and multi-CNN for stock trading decisions. Ameliorated GraphSAGE (AG) is used to learn graph embedding in daily market network constructed from comprehensive market information, with neighbors having higher correlation exerting stronger influence on the target node. Moreover, a more reasonable graph modeling approach is adopted to preserve the important features of time series while filtering out noise. Multi-scale time series and comments with sentiment information are collected to analyze short-term and long-term trends. The short-term features of the weighted graph are extracted by a dual concatenated CNN. The pre-trained model is fine-tuned based on transfer learning to address the issue of insufficient sentiment information in the long-term trend. Experimental results demonstrate that AG-MCNN achieves an average profit rate of 68.4094%, compared to the highest value of 46.1091% for comparison models and 18.2234% for the buy-and-hold strategy. AG-MCNN's high level of profitability in stock investments makes it a promising choice for investors.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Industrial process data are naturally in the form of complex time-series with high nonlinearities and dynamics. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are suitable for developing prediction models to handle nonlinear and dynamic process. However, LSTM neural networks have typically large and predefined structures, which may result in overfitting, and an optimal hidden neurons for a given problem cannot be automatically obtained. For this reason, a regularized self-organizing LSTM (RSOLSTM) is proposed to optimize both the structure and the parameters of the network. First, an adaptive learning algorithm based on l2-norm regularization is introduced for parameter adjustment. Thereafter, both the prediction accuracy and weight dispersion are considered to avoid overfitting. Second, a growing strategy is designed based on hidden neuronal sensitivity. The structure of the LSTM can then be determined automatically with improved compactness. Finally, a convergence analysis is performed to ensure the feasibility of RSO-LSTM. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed RSO-LSTM for timeseries prediction, its results for three benchmark experiments and real industrial data of a municipal solid waste incineration process were examined and compared with those of other methods. The results indicated the superiority and potential of RSO-LSTM for industrial applications. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) algorithms have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, designing models without the need for human expertise. Given the effectiveness of neural network models, Neural Architecture Search (NAS) specialises in designing their architectures autonomously, with results that rival the most advanced hand-crafted models. However, this approach requires significant computational resources and hardware investment, making it less attractive for real-world applications. This article presents the third version of Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNASv3), a new NAS algorithm that employs Sequential Model-Based Optimisation and Pareto optimality. This choice makes POPNASv3 flexible to different hardware environments, computational budgets and tasks, as the algorithm can efficiently explore user-defined search spaces of varying complexity. Pareto optimality extracts the architectures that achieve the best trade-off with respect to the metrics considered, reducing the number of models sampled during the search and dramatically improving time efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The experiments performed on image and time series classification datasets provide evidence that POPNASv3 can explore a large set of different operators and converge to optimal architectures suited to the type of data provided under different scenarios.1 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID COMBINATION; IMAGES
AB Type-2 fuzzy set is extensively studied in the past due to its superiority over type-1 fuzzy set, especially while dealing with data with higher uncertainty and higher association amongst them. This paper proposes a framework by introducing interval type-2 fuzzy set induced fuzzy rank-level fusion for face recognition utilizing multi-feature vectors. It utilizes the outputs of a classifier as confidence factors. We address the wide intra-class variability issue by introducing interval type-2 fuzzy sets by using these confidence factors to generate secondary membership values from the intra-class face images, which are then reduced to a primary membership value. It also mitigates the influence of inter-class similarity by excluding the inter-class face images in the computation. Furthermore, multi-feature vectors for a face image are used to utilize the underlying different discriminant features, which also in turn address the issues of inter-class similarity. For each feature vector, we generate interval type-2 fuzzy set based fuzzy ranks corresponding to all classes. To reduce the complexity, top k fuzzy ranks are fused with corresponding membership values to obtain the fuzzy ranks. Likewise, the interval type-2 fuzzy set based multiple fuzzy ranks are obtained using multiple feature vectors. Finally, these fuzzy ranks are fused with the corresponding complemented confidence factors to get the final fuzzy ranks, based on which a face image is classified and recognized. The method is evaluated on several face databases and found to be superior to the many state-of-the-art methods.

AB Feature selection aims to choose a subset of features with minimal feature-feature correlation and maximum feature-class correlation, which can be considered as a multi-objective problem. Grey wolf optimization mimics the leadership hierarchy and group hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. However, it can easily fall into local optimization in multi-objective optimization. To address this, a novel multi-objective binary grey wolf optimization based on a guided mutation strategy (GMS), called MOBGWO-GMS, is proposed. In the initialization phase, the population is initialized based on feature correlation, and features are selected using a uniform operator. The proposed GMS uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to provide direction for local search, improving the local exploration ability of the population. Moreover, a dynamic agitation mechanism is used for perturbation to prevent population stagnation due to the use of a single strategy. The strategy is dynamically adjusted to maintain population diversity and improve detection ability. To evaluate the classification ability of quasi-optimal subsets, a wrapper-based k-nearest neighbor classifier was employed. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated through an extensive comparison with eight well-known algorithms on fourteen benchmark datasets. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach is superior in the optimal trade-off between the two fitness evaluation criteria and can easily jump out of local optima compared to other algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Although they are among the most researched real world engineering design problems, it is encountered with significant problems in the optimization of structural truss bar problems (TPs). The main reasons for these problems are (i) the studies on the optimization of TPs being carried out with different experimental settings, (ii) the competitor algorithms used in the optimization process being insufficient, and (iii) the stability analysis and computational complexity information of the algorithms are not investigated. It is designed a simulation environment with defined standards and a benchmarking suite consisting of nine TPs of three different types in order to eliminate these problems. It is found optimum solutions for all problems in the benchmark suite and it is introduced feasible solutions for the first time. According to the statistical analysis results, among the seventy-seven competing algorithms, the best ten algorithms showed competitive performance in the optimization of TPs are LSHADE-EpSin, LSHADE-CnEpSin, SHADE, LSHADE, GSK, FDB-AGDE, MPA, LRFDB-COA and BES. According to the results of the stability analysis carried out on feasible solutions, it has been determined the algorithms with the best success rate for planar type; LSHADE, LSHADE-CnEpSin, LSHADE-EpSin and GSK with 100% success rate, LSHADE-CnEpSin, LSHADE-EpSin, LSHADE and SHADE for Space type with 100% success rate, and LSHADE-EpSin with 69% success rate for frequency constrained type. When the performances of the algorithms are evaluated regardless of the problem type, LSHADE-EpSin has been the most stable algorithm with an overall success rate of 90% on the TPs.

AB The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) with dynamic events and uncertainty is a strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem (COP) with extensive applications in the manufacturing system. Recently, growing interest has been aroused in utilizing machine learning techniques to solve the JSSP. However, most prior arts cannot handle dynamic events and barely consider uncertainties. To close this gap, this paper proposes a framework to solve a dynamic JSSP (DJSP) with machine breakdown and stochastic processing time based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). To this end, we first formulate the DJSP as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where disjunctive graph represent the states. Secondly, we propose a GNN-based model to effectively extract the embeddings of the state by considering the features of the dynamic events and the stochasticity of the problem, e.g., the machine breakdown and stochastic processing time. Then, the model constructs solutions by dispatching optimal operations to machines based on the learned embeddings. Notably, we propose to use the evolution strategies (ES) to find optimal policies that are more stable and robust than conventional DRL algorithms. The extensive experiments show that our method substantially outperforms existing reinforcement learning-based and traditional methods on multiple classic benchmarks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB When solving large-scale many-objective optimization problems (LMaOPs), due to the large number of variables and objectives involved, the algorithm is faced with a very high-dimensional and complex search space, which is difficult to be explored with limited resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a universal large-scale many-objective optimization framework based on cultural learning (UCLMO). First, a universal framework is proposed, and multi-objective optimizers can be embedded into the framework to accelerate the convergence. Moreover, inspired by cultural learning, an individual selection strategy based on historical knowledge is proposed to promote the diversity of the population, and an assisted evolution strategy based on normative knowledge is presented to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on multi-objective knapsack problems and LMaOPs with decision variables ranging from 500 to 1500, and the number of objectives ranging from 5 to 15. The experimental results verify the superiority and competitiveness of the proposed UCLMO framework in solving LMaOPs compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper studies a distributed heterogeneous flexible flowshop problem (DHFFP) with sequencedependent setup and transport times, where each job has a release time and each production stage has multiple unrelated parallel machines. An integer linear programming (ILP) model and a new artificial immune differential evolution (AIDE) algorithm are proposed aiming to minimize the makespan and total tardiness simultaneously. Firstly, the AIDE employs a two-dimensional vector encoding scheme including the information of job permutation and factory allocation for solution representation. In addition, a dynamic decoding scheme is designed to construct a feasible schedule. Secondly, three distributed Nawaz-Enscore-Ham (NEH) based constructive heuristics are presented to provide the initial antibody population. Thirdly, a discrete differential evolution algorithm is introduced to mutate the cloned antibodies. Further, clonal suppression is applied by eliminating the antibodies with lower stimulation values. Simulated annealing (SA) based local search is incorporated with four problem-specific neighborhood structures to enhance the algorithm. Finally, the optimal values of the algorithmic parameters are determined by the orthogonal test. Some numerical experiments of the ILP model on small-scale instances are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed AIDE algorithm. The AIDE algorithm is also compared with several existing algorithms for different scale instances. The results demonstrate that the AIDE algorithm generates average relative percentage deviation of 12.51% and 7.99% respectively for small & medium-scale instances and large-scale instances, which is the best-performing among all algorithms.

AB In this paper, a multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm (MOBES) is proposed. The MOBES introduces an archive mechanism to store the non-dominated solutions obtained by the algorithm. When the archive overflows, remove the most crowded solutions by using the roulette method. The MOBES also adds elite selection strategy to guide other individuals to optimize by selecting elite individuals in the population. The efficiency of MOBES is validated on CEC 2020 benchmark functions, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than its competitors in terms of convergence, diversity and distribution of solutions. The MOBES is also applied to two-objective, tri-objective and four-objective engineering design problems in real world. The results show its superiority in handling challenging multi-objective optimization problems with unknown true Pareto optimal solutions and fronts, and it is more competitive than other algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB There has been a growing interest in multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in recent years due to its wide range of practical applications. Multiple modalities allow for the integration of complementary information, improving the accuracy and precision of sentiment and emotion recognition tasks. However, working with multiple modalities presents several challenges, including handling data source heterogeneity, fusing information, aligning and synchronizing modalities, and designing effective feature extraction techniques that capture discriminative information from each modality. This paper introduces a novel framework called "Attention-based Multimodal Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Recognition (AMSAER)"to address these challenges. This framework leverages intra-modality discriminative features and inter-modality correlations in visual, audio, and textual modalities. It incorporates an attention mechanism to facilitate sentiment and emotion classification based on visual, textual, and acoustic inputs by emphasizing relevant aspects of the task. The proposed approach employs separate models for each modality to automatically extract discriminative semantic words, image regions, and audio features. A deep hierarchical model is then developed, incorporating intermediate fusion to learn hierarchical correlations between the modalities at bimodal and trimodal levels. Finally, the framework combines four distinct models through decision-level fusion to enable multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Interactive Emotional Dyadic Motion Capture (IEMOCAP) dataset. The results confirm a notable performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining 85% and 93% accuracy for sentiment analysis and emotion classification, respectively. Additionally, when considering class-wise accuracy, the results indicate that the "angry"emotion and "positive"sentiment are classified more effectively than the other emotions and sentiments, achieving 96.80% and 93.14% accuracy, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB From one side, Evolutionary Algorithms have enabled enormous progress over the last years in the optimization field. They have been applied to a variety of problems, including optimization of Neural Networks' architectures. On the other side, the Echo State Network (ESN) model has become increasingly popular in time series prediction, for instance when modeling chaotic sequences. The network has numerous hidden neurons forming a recurrent topology, so-called reservoir, which is fixed during the learning process. Initial reservoir design has mostly been made by human experts; as a consequence, it is prone to errors and bias, and it is a time consuming task. In this paper, we introduce an automatic general neuroevolutionary framework for ESNs, on which we develop a computational tool for evolving reservoirs, called EVOlutionary Echo State Network (EvoESN). To increase efficiency, we represent the large matrix of reservoir weights in the Fourier space, where we perform the evolutionary search strategy. This frequency space has major advantages compared with the original weight space. After updating the Fourier coefficients, we go back to the weight space and perform a conventional training phase for full setting the reservoir architecture. We analyze the evolutionary search employing genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization, obtaining promising results with the latter over three well-known chaotic time series. The proposed framework leads fast to very good results compared with modern ESN models. Hence, this contribution positions an important family of recurrent systems in the promising neuroevolutionary domain.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB One-Class Classification (OCC) corresponds to a subclass of unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) that is valuable when labeled data is non-existent. In this paper, we present AutoOC, a computationally efficient Grammatical Evolution (GE) approach that automatically searches for OCC models. AutoOC assumes a multi-objective optimization, aiming to increase the OCC predictive performance while reducing the ML training time. AutoOC also includes two execution speedup mechanisms, a periodic training sampling, and a multi-core fitness evaluation. In particular, we study two AutoOC variants: a pure Neuroevolution (NE) setup that optimizes two types of deep learning models, namely dense Autoencoder (AE) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE); and a general Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) ALL setup that considers five distinct OCC base learners, specifically Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One-Class SVM (OC-SVM), AE and VAE. Several experiments were conducted, using eight public OpenML datasets and two validation scenarios (unsupervised and supervised). The results show that AutoOC requires a reasonable amount of execution time and tends to obtain lightweight OCC models. Moreover, AutoOC provides quality predictive results, outperforming a baseline IF for all analyzed datasets and surpassing the best supervised OpenML human modeling for two datasets. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study presents the game modeling of the multi-objective frequency assignment problem (FAP) in cellular networks considering two conflicting objectives: interference and separation costs, while respecting separation constraints, and thus improving the QoS for end users. Two types of cooperative games are suggested depending on the TRX and frequency selection strategies each using two players, one for each considered objective. A feasible solution consisting of a frequency assignment plan is built during the constructive process. At each step of the game, a player assigns a frequency to a TRX according to a given strategy. The proposed solution being part of both multi-objective optimization (MOO) and game theory (GT), we used the most important measures in these two fields: the hypervolume (HV) and the Nash value, to evaluate the performance of our solutions to able to compare our results with those of these two communities: MOO and GT. The proposed games achieve a good trade-off between the two considered objectives corroborated by tests on two real-world instances, Denver and Seattle, demonstrating the performance of the proposed approach in solving the problem. Furthermore, the proposed performance evaluation method is innovative and also generic, since it can be adapted to any algorithm based on both GT and MOO, taking into account these two aspects.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This research work discusses a noise-robust picture fuzzy clustering method with an application to the MRI image segmentation problem. The MRI images suffer from the problem of noise and non-linear structures. Although there are many variants of fuzzy set theory and intuitionistic fuzzy set theory-based clustering approaches to handle the problem of noise and non-linearity present in the image during the segmentation process, still they lack in achieving accurate segmentation. To overcome this problem, we have suggested using the picture fuzzy set theoretic approach which enhances the representational capability of the data and helps in handling the non-linear structures present in the image, and in our proposed work, the picture fuzzy Euclidean distance is replaced with modified picture fuzzy total Bregman divergence using the spatial neighborhood information around the sample. Squared Euclidean distance is itself a special case of Bregman Divergence, hence Bregman divergence helps to explore the details in a better way thus resulting in noise suppression. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm proves to be robust in preserving the image details using picture fuzzy set theory and is free from any parameter selection due to the incorporation of a local information factor. The algorithm was performed on a synthetic image corrupted with "Gaussian", "salt and pepper", "mixture of Gaussian and salt and pepper noise" of different intensities, "Brainweb" datasets corrupted with noise, six real "IBSR" datasets along with seven "MRbrainS18" datasets. Performance measures used were partition coefficient, partition entropy, dice score (DS), average segmentation accuracy (ASA), and XB index, and the proposed method was robust when compared to a series of algorithms stated in the literature.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Various deep learning architectures have been developed to capture long-term dependencies in time series data, but challenges such as overfitting and computational time still exist. The recently proposed optimization strategy called Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization prevents overfitting by minimizing a perturbed loss within the nearby parameter space. However, SAM requires doubled training time to calculate two gradients per iteration, hindering its practical application in time series modeling such as real-time assessment. In this study, we demonstrate that sharpness-aware training improves generalization performance by capturing trend and seasonal components of time series data. To avoid the computational burden of SAM, we leverage the periodic characteristics of time series data and propose a new fast sharpness-aware training method called Periodic Sharpness-Aware Time series Training (PSATT) that reuses gradient information from past iterations. Empirically, the proposed method achieves both generalization and time efficiency in time series classification and forecasting without requiring additional computations compared to vanilla optimizers.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As the modern energy systems is becoming more complex and flexible, accurate load forecasting has been the key to scheduling power to meet customers' needs, load switching, and infrastructure development. In this paper, we propose a neural network framework based on a modified deep residual network (DRN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) for addressing the short-term load forecasting (STLF) problem. The proposed model not only inherits the DRN's excellent characteristic to avoid vanishing gradient for training deeper neural networks, but also continues the LSTM's strong ability to capture nonlinear patterns for time series forecasting. Moreover, through the dimension weighted units based on attention mechanism, the dimension-wise feature response is adaptively recalibrated by explicitly modeling the interdependencies between dimensions, so that we can jointly improve the performance of the model from three aspects: depth, time and feature dimension. The snapshot ensemble method has also been applied to improve the accuracy and robustness of the proposed model. By implementing multiple sets of experiments on two public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed model has high accuracy, robustness and generalization capability, and can perform STLF better than the existing mainstream models. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB As a metabolic disease, diabetes is a serious threat to human health, in which type 2 diabetes (T2D) constitutes about 90% of diabetic cases. As the disease progresses, T2D often comes with various complications such as kidney disease and retinopathy, which may cause huge threats to patients' health. In recent years, complication prediction of T2D has gained wide research interest as early disease detection and management can effectively reduce the risk of death. In this paper, to break through the limitation of the available data and achieve higher overall prediction accuracy, an improved feature space-based gradient boosting regression tree ensemble (IFS-GBRTE) approach is proposed for the risk prediction of developing T2D complications. Specifically, the original feature space is expanded based on existing feature generation theories. Then the new feature space is refined by comparing the total contribution of each feature during the construction of a classification and regression tree (CART) under a cross-validation scheme. Finally, a gradient boosting ensemble algorithm using CART as base learners is utilized for model training. The prediction model is validated on the T2D data provided by the China National Clinical Medical Science Data Center. The experimental results show that the proposed IFSGBRTE achieves 82.49% accuracy and realizes better generalization ability than compared single models and ensemble learning models, meanwhile it is helpful to obtain more effective predictive variables for improving the accuracy of risk prediction of T2D complications, which is of great significance for achieving the early prevention, screening and nursing of complications, and further reducing mortality and save medical resources.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study proposes the semantic-explicit features that characterize difficulty, and jointly optimizes feature selection and classifier hyperparameters by the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) to deal with the corresponding mixed-integer programming problem with constructing large-scale piano score difficulty level datasets. The difficulty level of piano scores is essential for piano learners to choose the appropriate piece, especially for beginners and amateurs. However, the previous studies lack an open access baseline dataset and sufficient difficulty-related features, as well as the separate optimization of and feature and model hyperparameter. To address such problems, this study constructs largescale difficulty-level datasets, proposes novel difficulty-related features, and jointly optimizes feature selection and classifier hyperparameters due to the coupled effect of feature selection and model optimization. The search space of the joint optimization is complex due to the strong mutual constraint relationship of difficulty levels in the piano-score difficulty measurement (PSDM) problem. SSA is adapted to the joint optimization scheme of the PSDM problem with the advantages of only one main controlling parameter and less computation complexity involving the gradual SSA movement approach to balance global exploration and local exploitation in an unknown and complex search space. The joint-optimization mechanism by SSA achieves an overall accuracy of 78.80% and 60.68% on two datasets of 677 and 2040 piano pieces with difficulty levels of four and nine, respectively. The results of recognition accuracy obviously validate the distinguished performance of our joint-optimization scheme compared to the successive optimization and joint optimization by other seven optimization algorithms in terms of the PSDM problem.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Sequential recommendation; Contrastive learning; Frequency -domain
   augmentation; Recommender systems
AB Sequential recommendation has recently played an important role on various platforms due to its ability to understand users' intentions from their historical interactions. However, modeling user's intention on time-based representations poses challenges, such as fast-evolving interests, noisy interactions, and sparse data. While contrastive self-supervised learning can mitigate these issues, the complexity of time-based interactions limits the utility of understanding the user's intention. Motivated by this limitation, we posit that intent representations need to accommodate different domains. To this end, we expect both the frequency-domain augmented view and the time-domain augmented view of the same sample should be maximally consistent with their original input in their corresponding domains. Inspired by this idea, we propose Contrastive Learning with Frequency Domain for Sequential Recommendation (CLF4SRec), where a learnable Fourier layer provides the frequency-based self-supervised signal. Instead of pre-training, we employ a multi-task learning framework jointly with contrastive learning and recommendation learning to optimize the user representation encoder. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, where CLF4SRec outperforms the recent strongest baselines from 7.58% to 67.85%, showing its effectiveness for sequential recommendation tasks. Specifically, CLF4SRec can achieve a boost of 41.88% to 67.85% on the dense dataset, which might be attributed to the ability of frequency domain technology to handle dense signals.

AB According to our extensive investigation, Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and its variants have not been applied to solve high-dimensional optimization problems. To make a breakthrough in this field, a new BBO variant with hybrid migration operator and feedback differential evolution mechanism, HFBBO, is proposed. Firstly, the example learning method is used to ensure the inferior solutions cannot destroy the superior solutions. Secondly, the hybrid migration operator is presented to balance the exploration and exploitation. It enables the algorithm to switch freely between local search and global search. Finally, the feedback differential evolution mechanism is designed to replace the random mutation operator. HFBBO can select the mutation mode intelligently by this mechanism to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Meanwhile, the Markov model is established to prove the convergence of HFBBO, and the complexity is also discussed. A series experiments are carried out on 24 benchmark functions, CEC2017 test suite and 12 real-world engineering problems. The results of the Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and Friedman's test show that HFBBO has better competitiveness and stability than the 27 compared algorithms. Furtherly, the performance of HFBBO is compared on 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10000 dimensions, respectively. Experimental results show that this method can effectively solve high-dimensional optimization problems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Collaborative teams pursue common goals, completing tasks and making decisions with various levels of interdependence. A shared mental model (SMM) is a foundational structure in high performing, production teams and aids humans in predicting their teammate's goals and intentions. Advice teams utilize a transactive memory system (TMS) that integrate sources of knowledge and the source's credibility. SMMs and TMSs elevate human performance when the nature of emergence complements the associated team type. However, project and action teams require both behavioral and knowledge integration. We present a hybrid cognitive model (HCM) for machine agents that unifies SMM and TMS characteristics. The HCM enables anytime selection over the two cognitive representations with the computational complexity of a single model. Furthermore, the pliant nature of credibility modeling in TMSs can represent expertise, thoroughness, or trust simultaneously in the team context. Results in a multi-agent project domain demonstrate the HCM's efficacy for machine agent teams and potential for applications in human-machine teams.

AB Intelligent fault diagnosis based on deep learning has been more attractive in practical engineering. However, its accuracy is constrained by unlabeled data and large domain shift for cross-domain fault diagnosis. As an unsupervised learning network, the autoencoder (AE) can relieve the pressure of unlabeled data. Using it as a building block, this paper presents a novel deep clustering network, named as clustering graph convolutional network with multiple adversarial learning (c-GCN-MAL) for intelligent fault diagnosis of various bearings. First, multiple representation of datasets, i.e., the datasets and their structured relatedness, are extracted by AE and graph convolutional network (GCN) to recognize different classes and their related information. Then, the dataadversarial and domain-adversarial are individually set by newly defining the loss function of the proposed deep network, so that its clustering and transfer ability for new dataset can be enhanced. In experiments, it is applied to four open-source bearing datasets and one dataset of practical bearings. Transfer tasks between different rotation speeds, damage generation, and experimental bearings, even the transfer from experimental bearings to wheelset bearings used in real tests, are assigned to verify the effectiveness of the proposed network. The experimental results and comparisons indicate that the proposed deep clustering network is feasible for the transfer with large domain shift and can provide noticeably higher accuracy and stable results for cross-domain fault diagnosis of bearings.

AB Published research has confirmed the bias of automated face-based gender classification algorithms across gender-racial groups. Specifically, unequal accuracy rates were obtained for women and dark-skinned people for face-based automated gender classification algorithms. To mitigate the bias of gender classification and other facial-analysis-based algorithms in general, the vision community has proposed several techniques. However, most of the existing bias mitigation techniques suffer from a lack of generalizability, need a demographicallyannotated training set, are application-specific, and often offer a trade-off between fairness and classification accuracy. This means that fairness is often obtained at the cost of a reduction in the classification accuracy of the best-performing demographic sub-group. In this paper, we propose a novel bias mitigation technique that leverages the power of semantic preserving augmentations at the image- and feature-level in a self-consistency setting for the downstream gender classification task. Thorough experimental validation on gender-annotated facial image datasets confirms the efficacy of our bias mitigation technique in improving overall gender classification accuracy as well as reducing bias across all gender-racial groups over state-of-the-art bias mitigation techniques. Specifically, our proposed technique obtained a reduction in the bias by an average of 30% over existing bias mitigation techniques as well as an improvement in the overall classification accuracy of about 5% over the baseline gender classifier. Therefore, resulting in state-of-the-art generalization performance in the intra- and cross-dataset evaluations. Additionally, our proposed technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic, compared to most of the existing bias mitigation techniques.

ID INFORMATION; SETS
AB Hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) are a powerful tool to describe uncertain and vague information, whose relationship can be analyzed and mined by clustering algorithms. The partitional idea is widely used in clustering analysis for real-number data but little for hesitant fuzzy data. After pointing out the weakness of the existing partitional clustering algorithms between HFSs, we modify the existing partitional clustering algorithms and propose four new algorithms with two types under hesitant fuzzy environment. One type, including the hesitant fuzzy K-medians (HFKME) and the hesitant fuzzy C -medians (HFCME) algorithms, is based on median but not mean. The other type, including the improved hesitant fuzzy K-means (IHFKM) and the improved hesitant fuzzy C-means (IFHCM) algorithms, is on the basis of a new and more robust distance measure which will be developed by HFSs. We find that these four new clustering algorithms are more robust than the existing ones and have better performance under the noise environment. After that, we compare our proposed partitional clustering algorithms with each other and also compare them with the existing methods, and then apply them to multi-attribute decision making and cluster analysis. Numerical results show that HFCME has better performance than HFKME, and IHFCM is better than IHFKM. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Prediction of a non-stationary time-series is hard as the frequency components and their amplitudes in the series vary randomly over time. This paper proposes a 2-phase approach for prediction of such non-stationary time-series. The first phase employs Taylor series to approximately predict the next time-point value in the series from its current and last two preceding sample values. The Taylor series based prediction, however, presumes that the time-series is locally stationary. The second phase employs reinforcement learning to refine the Taylor series based prediction further, particularly at the juncture of structural changes in the time-series. The reinforcement learning based prediction is realized with the help of an adaptive probabilistic learning matrix that evolves to encode the mapping between current prediction error and the error-compensation for the next sample. On convergence of the matrix, the saved probabilities are used to determine the error-compensation for the next sample from the estimated error at the current sample. The additive error-compensation is then utilized to rectify the results of prediction obtained by Taylor series.

AB Recombination is a key component for the evolutionary algorithm to provide promising offspring solutions. However, conventional recombination operators cannot generate high-quality solutions for variable linkages problems due to the particularity of the Pareto optimal set (PS). To tackle this problem, a two-stage multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on direction vector guidance (DSMOEA) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a portion of the population is transformed by the eigenmatrix of the covariance matrix to increase the probability of generating high-quality offspring. Then the representative solutions are selected in the transformed population to create the direction vectors. Under the guidance of the direction vectors, the population rapidly approaches PS and generates promising offspring solutions. Finally, Differential Evolution (DE) is performed for searching globally to increase the diversity of the population. The proposed algorithm is tested on three classes of variable linkages problems with 30, 50, and 100 dimensions to verify its performance. The results show that the algorithm is promising for variable linkages problems.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Modular neural network; Empirical mode decomposition; Sample entropy;

AB Time series is mostly with a chaotic nature and non-stationary characteristic in real-word, which makes it difficult to be modeled and predicted accurately. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel self-organizing modular neural network based on the empirical mode decomposition with the sliding window mechanism (SWEMD-MNN) for time series prediction. In SWEMD-MNN, the improved empirical mode decomposition with sliding window (SWEMD) is developed to decompose time series online, which can effectively alleviate the limitation that the traditional EMD-based models cannot handle the long term or online problem and end effect. Thus, SWEMD-MNN can decompose time series based on time characteristic effectively and dynamically, and improve the prediction accuracy of the classical modular neural networks dividing time series based on sample space. Then time subseries are dynamically assigned to the subnetworks with a single layer feedforward neural network using the sample entropy and Euclidean distance for learning. Experimental investigations using benchmark chaotic and real-world time series show that SWEMD-MNN can decompose time series effectively and dynamically, and provides a better prediction accuracy than the fully coupled networks and other MNN models for time series prediction.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Instant delivery is an important part of urban logistics distribution, which realizes point-to-point distribution between merchants and customers. During the peak period of orders, instant delivery is a large-scale variable NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, which increases the difficulty and complexity of scheduling greatly. To solve the large-scale vehicle routing problem of instant delivery in peak periods, a knowledge-driven ant colony optimization (KDACO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. First, the knowledge base is established to guide evolutionary search, including the knowledge of order priority and the feature knowledge of feasible schemes. Second, the pheromone supplementation strategy is designed based on the knowledge of order priority, enhancing the guiding ability of the pheromone table. Third, the adaptive evolutionary operator is designed based on the feature knowledge of feasible schemes, improving the optimization efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments on extensive classical datasets show that the proposed KDACO can obtain superior performance to other state-of-the-art algorithms in the instant delivery peak period. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is widely used in multi-sensor data fusion. However, how to manage the counterintuitive result generated by the highly conflicting evidence remains an open question. To solve the problem, a novel multi-sensor data fusion method is proposed, which analyses the credibility of evidence from both the discrepancy between evidences and the factors of evidence itself. Firstly, a new Belief Kullback-Leibler divergence is put forward, which evaluates the credibility of evidence from the discrepancy between evidences. Secondly, another credibility measure called the Probability Transformation Belief Factor is defined, which assesses the credibility of evidence from the evidence itself. These two credibilities are combined as the comprehensive credibility of evidence. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of evidence, a new belief entropy based on the cross-information within the evidence is presented, which is applied to quantify the information volume of evidence and to adjust the comprehensive credibility of evidence. The adjusted comprehensive credibility is regarded as the final weight to modify the body of evidence. Finally, the Dempster's combination rule is applied for fusion. Experiment and applications show that the proposed method is effective and superior. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB Multimodal optimization problems (MMOPs) aim to simultaneously locate as many global optima as possible with high accuracy. Recently, many niching strategies have been wildly used in evolutionary algorithms to solve MMOPs due to the advantage of maintaining the diversity of population. However, most multimodal algorithms are sensitive to the niching parameters and lack effective methods to update the "stagnant individuals", including individuals that have trapped into local optima or converged to the same optima. In this paper, a minimum spanning tree niching-based differential evolution (TNDE) with knowledge-driven update (KDU) strategy is proposed to better solve the above challenges, where the "knowledge"includes historical evolutionary information, fitness distribution information, and individual distribution information. In TNDE, a minimum spanning tree niching (MSTN) strategy is proposed to adaptively divide the population, which can adjust the number of niches dynamically. Besides, the KDU strategy is proposed to utilize the knowledge to locate and update stagnant individuals. Lastly, an improved differential evolution with local stage-based mutation (LSM) and directional guidance selection (DGS) strategies is proposed to accelerate convergence and refine the accuracy of solutions, respectively. The comparison results with 16 state-of-the-art algorithms on CEC'2013 show that TNDE achieves significant advantages on high-dimensional problems or problems with many global optima. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Different from the traditional neural network models based on empirical risk minimization principle, support vector regression (SVR) minimizes the upper limit of generalization error by the structural risk minimization principle. SVR is suitable for solving nonlinear, small-sample, high-dimensional modelling, and pattern recognition problems. However, the selection of hyperparameters of SVR can significantly affect the prediction accuracy and computational time. This paper proposes a method to optimize the SVR hyperparameters through an intelligent optimization algorithm, specifically multi -objective slime mould algorithm (MOSMA). MOSMA is a new multi-objective optimization algorithm with strong global search ability and fast convergence. The principle and calculation process of MOSMA are first described in detail. The analytical method for transforming the SVR hyperparameter optimization problem into a multi-objective problem is then presented. The process of optimizing two SVR hyperparameters (the penalty coefficient and radial basis function kernel parameter) based on MOSMA is described in steps. Meanwhile, the procedures of algorithm parameter setting, fitness function design, and population update are given. To investigate the characteristics and performance of MOSMA-SVR, two datasets are used to predict the vibration trend of the spindle of CNC milling machine in one and the maximum bending normal stress in the cutting process in the other. The performance of MOSMA-SVR is evaluated by multiple statistical indexes and compared with seven other prediction models (GA-SVR, PSO-SVR, ABC-SVR, GWO-SVR, SSA-SVR, SMA-SVR and MOWOA-SVR).& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Skeleton-based action recognition is widely used in varied areas such as human-machine interaction and virtual reality. Benefit from the powerful expression ability to depict structural data, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been developed to address this task by modeling the human body skeletons as spatial-temporal graphs. However, most existing GCN-based methods usually ignore the diversity of the motion information between channels of the input feature. And how to enhance the ability to capture the long-term global correlations in spatial and temporal dimensions is also a fundamental challenge. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stream framework Global-Local Motion Fusion Network (GLMFN), which integrates the global and local motion information of spatial-temporal dimensions. Specifically, we design a grouping graph convolution module to enforce the ability to aggregate local spatial motion information. Besides, to learn richer semantic features, we propose two modules based on the self-attention operator: a spatial self-attention module and a temporal self-attention module. The former is responsible for extracting spatial long-term motion relationships, while the latter aims to capture temporal long-term motion relationships. Moreover, we present a multi-stream fusion strategy with a series of treatments for body joints to achieve a better recognition effect. To validate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed model, we perform exhaustive experiments on the NTU-RGBD dataset and NTU-RGBD-120 dataset, and our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.

AB In recent years, there has been an unprecedented upsurge in applying deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to solve image denoising problems, owing to their superior performance. However, CNNs mostly rely on Gaussian noise, and there is a conspicuous lack of exploiting CNNs for salt-and-pepper (SAP) noise reduction. In this paper, we proposed a deep CNN model, namely SeConvNet, to suppress SAP noise in gray-scale and color images. To meet this objective, we introduce a new selective convolutional (SeConv) block. SeConvNet is compared to state-of-the-art SAP denoising methods using extensive experiments on various common datasets. The results illustrate that the proposed SeConvNet model effectively restores images corrupted by SAP noise and surpasses all its counterparts at both quantitative criteria and visual effects, especially at high and very high noise densities.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) platform will release projects consisting of heterogeneous tasks, requiring participants with different skills to collaborate to develop such systems. In this paper, a heterogeneous multi-project multi-task allocation model is proposed based on the group collaboration mode to cater for this problem state. Our method would distinguish the roles of members within the group, and incorporate the inherent attributes of participants like skill level and social competence. With the constraints of skill matching and completion time, one needs to simultaneously maximize the sensing quality and to minimize the platform cost by finding an optimal task-participant allocation schedule. To solve the established model, a multi-objective fireworks algorithm with dual-feedback ensemble learning framework is proposed. The weight of the weak optimizer would be adjusted automatically by the evolutionary significance, for which the individual generation method more suitable for the current state would be chosen. The individual evaluation mechanism is updated by the objective exploration degree, so that the evolutionary direction can be adaptively adjusted. To experimentally evaluate the proposed approach, it would be compared with five representative algorithms on 12 real-world instances. Experimental results show that our algorithm can assist platform managers in making better decisions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has developed rapidly and has been applied to multi-UAV target tracking (MTT) research. However, DRL still faces challenges in data utilization and learning speed. To better solve the above problems, a novel two-stage DRL-based multi-UAV decision-making method is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a sample generator combining artificial potential field with proportional-integral-derivative is used to produce expert experience data. On this basis, a two-stage reinforcement learning training method is introduced. For the first stage, the policy network and critic network are pre-trained using expert data, combined with behavior cloning loss and additional Q-value loss, which reduces ineffective exploration and speeds up learning. For the second RL stage, by calculating the average return of the last recent k excellent episodes, the excellent experience generated by the agent itself is screened out and used to guide the policy network to choose the actions with high reward, thus improving the efficiency of data utilization. Extensive simulation experiments show that our method not only enables multi-UAV to continuously track the target in obstacle environments but also significantly improves the learning speed and convergence effect.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper investigates the high-speed train rescheduling (HSTR) problem under a partial station blockage and proposes an efficient problem-specific strengthen elitist genetic algorithm (PS-SEGA) for HSTR. Firstly, a HSTR model subject to train operation constraints is established to minimize the total train delay. A permutation-based encoding method is developed to define an efficient search space based on the train departure sequence. A heuristic decoding method is employed to eliminate all train operation constraints and output the rescheduled timetable. Moreover, a hybrid initialization method involving an efficient heuristic strategy (EHS) is put forward to accelerate the convergence speed of PS-SEGA. Using problem-specific knowledge, EHS generates an efficient and feasible solution for the initial population. Finally, a restart strategy is presented to maintain genetic diversity. Compared with other advanced evolutionary algorithms and their improved variants also using the improvements of PS-SEGA, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PS -SEGA for addressing HSTR scenarios under the partial station blockage. As for the scenarios that CPLEX cannot obtain optimal solutions within 10 min, PS-SEGA can provide quasi-optimal solutions in real time. Furthermore, compared with the other two heuristics algorithms (i.e., First-Scheduled-First-Served and EHS), PS-SEGA can give the train departure sequence with a smaller total train delay.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Owing to uncertainty in the stock market, stock price prediction has always been a challenging research hotspot. In recent years, many stock prediction methods have used stock price series and technical indicators as inputs and the time series algorithm to predict, but they often ignore the influence of deeper factors such as the situation of the stock company and current situation of the stock industry. In addition, most of them predict based on small-scale stock datasets with limited characteristics and have certain defects such as bias, poor stability of prediction results, and lack of statistical significance tests on experimental results. To solve these problems, we propose a new method for stock price prediction based on knowledge graph (KG) and graph convolution neural network (GCN) models. First, stock KG is constructed, and the semantic relationships between stocks are described in the form of triples. Second, the correlations between stocks are quantified by fully utilizing their explicit/implicit relationships in the KG. Third, K-means, community detection (CD), and GCNs are merged to obtain accurate clustering results for similar stocks. Finally, the historical prices of similar stocks are used as the input characteristics of the time series models to predict stock price trends. We collect 4684 A-share market stocks in China from 2013 to 2019 and predicted the stock price trends for 762 of them. The experimental results and significance test show that the proposed method achieve the best accuracy, precision, and F1-measure on large-scale stock datasets and have the best stability, proving that the overall prediction effect outperforms that by state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years, awareness of environmental protection and social responsibility has increased, making sustainable supply chain development and the selection of sustainable suppliers more important. The construction of a criteria system is the premise of sustainable supplier selection (SSS), which determines the final decision. Recognizing the limitations of existing research works, including subjectively determined evaluation criteria based only on the literature and personal experience, and neglecting the characteristics of different product categories and the combination effect of different criteria, this research designs a product-category-oriented intelligent SSS criteria system construction model by applying the random forest algorithm and the recursive feature elimination cross-validation method. The novelties and contributions of this paper include, first, a systematic SSS criteria system construction model from a new perspective of product category is designed to help buyers construct a comprehensive, reliable, and efficient SSS criteria system. Second, the appropriate integration of human experience and machine learning fully exploits the advantages of both subjective judgement and objective analysis. Third, the ideas and methods of group decision making are introduced for the first time into the SSS criteria system construction process, and the relative importance of different decision-makers are taken into account. Finally, the proposed model can construct the optimal SSS criteria system while considering the combination effect of the whole criteria system. The model was validated in a Chinese forklift company, helping the company to construct a criteria system containing nine criteria with 86.68% accuracy rate. The results of comparative and sensitivity analyses show that the accuracy of the proposed model can achieve an 8.11% improvement compared with other existing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The vehicle routing problem (VRP), an NP-hard problem of considerable complexity, pertains to the determination of optimal sequences of customer visits in an effort to minimize the total operational cost of vehicles. Conventional approaches to tackling VRP have primarily focused on optimizing each task independently, utilizing mathematical methodologies or evolutionary algorithms. Nevertheless, research exploring the application of the advanced concept of evolutionary multitasking (EMT) to address VRP remains limited. To enrich the body of knowledge in this field, our study presents an innovative EMT algorithm, dubbed EMT-RD. This algorithm employs a bidirectional adaptive codec to facilitate the transfer of information between real and discrete solutions. The EMT-RD algorithm permits the transfer of real and discrete solutions across varying tasks, utilizing an encoding rule that transforms information from real to discrete solutions for each task. Further, a decoding rule from discrete to real solutions generates search experiences, facilitating the transfer of knowledge between real solutions. The mechanism is capped off with an adaptive transfer strategy that instigates transfer operations across different tasks. Each task is tackled using a single-task optimization algorithm that employs an artificial bee colony algorithm. Through comprehensive experimentation, we found that our proposed EMT-RD algorithm outperforms competitors on 168 VRP with time windows multitasking instance pairs and four real-world problem pairs that were developed for this study. These results underscore the efficacy of the adaptive transfer strategy and bidirectional adaptive codec in addressing inter-task correlations when solving the VRP. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) integrating kinematics analysis and immune opti-mization (KAI-DDPG) is proposed to address the drawbacks of DDPG in path planning. An orientation angle reward component, linear velocity reward factor, and safety performance reward factor are added to the DDPG reward function based on kinematic modeling and analysis of mobile robots. A multi-objective performance index turns the path planning problem into one of multi-objective optimization. We propose KA-DDPG, which uses the orientation angle, linear speed, and safety degree as evaluation indices, and information entropy to alter the influence coefficient of the multi -objective function in the reward function. KAI-DDPG is proposed to address the low learning and training efficiency of KA-DDPG, using immune optimization to optimize the experience samples in the experience buffer pool.

AB This paper presents an antigravity-based fuzzy Gravitational Search Algorithm (AFGSA) to solve the economic dispatch problem (EDP) with various constraints. Based on an antigravity mechanism combined with an adaptive fuzzy parameter controller AFGSA is designed. By doing so, it ensures a proper balance between exploration and exploitation of GSA. Furthermore, the simulated annealing (SA) process is introduced to control the application of anti-gravitation forces and guarantee the convergence rate. A fuzzy optimizing system is applied to adaptively control the parameters in GSA. The success of the suggested algorithm is firstly shown in eight various test EDPs including static and dynamic economic load problems as well as hydrothermal scheduling problems by varying the complex constraints. Then, the efficiency of the proposed optimizer is validated through ten CEC2020 test functions. The performance of AFGSA is verified by comparison with numerous state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results show that AFGSA provides a more competing and robust solution to the EDPs than the compared algorithms. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Surrogate models have attracted considerable interest as approximation tools that can save consid-erable computational resources in various applications. In this study, a recursive surrogate model was developed based on a generalized regression neural network and variable-fidelity surrogate method. The proposed model can continuously improve its prediction accuracy using a novel recursive correction method. Ultimately, a model with sufficient predictive accuracy can be obtained. To verify the performance of the proposed model, we conducted a series of comparative experiments using test functions and an engineering problem. The results showed that the proposed model has better predictive accuracy and robustness than the other benchmark models. Additionally, the impacts of the stopping criteria and spread factor on the performance of the proposed model were investigated, and the time cost associated with the modeling process was analyzed. This model presents a novel option for engineering design optimization. The recursive correction method also provides a new approach for other regression models to further improve their prediction accuracy.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Previously, doctors interpreted diseases and their outcomes according to their experience in diagnosis. However, with the rapid increase in technology and population, the task of examining the patient becomes cumbersome and sometimes human efforts produce inconsistent results. Several research is being done for healthcare in terms of improving visualization and accuracy by using machine learning models. The current research targets to explore quantum computing as a different way of processing information compared to classical computer systems such as the use of quantum bits (qubits) along with superposition and entanglement for extending the computation capabilities at an unprecedented level of thinking in the healthcare domain. Quantum computing systems provide exponential benefits in terms of high-speed processing, faster and easier diagnostic assistance, unimaginable reduction in processing throughput, and many more. An extensive comparative analysis of existing approaches has been made which benchmarks the need for quantum healthcare computing. The objective of this work is to interpret whether Quantum computers prove to be more trusted when it comes to patient diagnosis, and faster analysis leading to cost optimization. In order to accelerate patient diagnosis, different approaches have been presented. The authors have proposed a precision-based granular approach for patient diagnosis that incorporates diagnosing the disease with enhanced precision and granularity. It involves reporting symptoms by the patient, encountering by healthcare expert on multiple factors, precise examination, granular health status (understanding past and present medical history), followed by a precise intervention by understanding biomolecular simulations. The algorithm has been presented to describe the flow process for patient diagnosis modeling using quantum computing. It involves qubits initialization, pairing the values, assigning probabilistic values, cross validation, and quantum circuit formation. Precision-based granular approach has been implemented for a scenario (consisting of medical parameters such as oxygen and heart rate level, with the functionality of diagnosing oxygen level and heart range which lies as either normal or not normal (high/low)). Precision-based granular approach deals specifically with the individual 'biomolecular simulation by understanding variations in the individual body whereas the umbrella-based approach does not deal with specifically to individual mechanisms. Granular level of encounter is not possible in umbrella-based treatment. Python Jupyter notebook and IBM Composer tool is used for the implementation of results. Bloch sphere and computational state graph are obtained as an output for better visualization and understanding. Falcon r5.11H processor is used with the version of 1.0.24 of IBM Composer to simulate the experiment. The methodology using precision based granular approach provides timely encounter of disease along with umbrella diagnosis and precise treatment. The time is taken and frequency of qubits have been presented with promising results. The diagnosis process and optimizing cost efficiency can aid in an early detection of the disease.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In geotechnical engineering, surrogate modeling is a vital technique for enhancing computational efficiency when faced with limited and costly samples. However, most adaptive sequential sampling (ASS) methods use the Kriging model, which directly evaluates the uncertainty of the model at unsampled points, but they are not efficient in solving multiple output problems. A few studies use cross validation to indirectly evaluate the uncertainty of other surrogate models, which is time-consuming to repeatedly train multiple models. In addition, few methods consider input feature sensitivity, which further reduces the efficiency of ASS methods. To address these issues, this study proposes a hybrid ASS method that combines artificial neural networks with Monte Carlo dropout (ANN_MCD) and random forests (RF). The ANN is suitable for multiple output problems, and the MCD enables the ANN architecture to stochastically transform and efficiently predict uncertainty at unsampled points with a single model training. The RF evaluates input feature sensitivity, assigns weights to the sampling space based on feature sensitivity, and effectively avoids the interference of low-sensitivity features. Furthermore, two active learning functions are proposed to regulate the sampling areas on either a global scale or close to the limit state function, depending on the problem type. The study validates the efficacy of the proposed method through three representative geotechnical engineering examples: system reliability analysis of soil slope, back-analysis of soil constitutive parameters, and estimating the penetration rate in diamond drilling. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed method has less computational cost than related studies and has more potential in addressing geotechnical sampling.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   METHODOLOGY
AB In this study, the fabric dyeing process in a towel manufacturing factory is investigated, focusing on the batching of towel fabric bolts with different quantities and features belonging to different orders in multi-port dyeing machines. This research differs from previous studies in several aspects. Firstly, it is considered three different objectives: total tardiness, total number of washes (sequence-dependent setups), and total machine fixed cost. These objectives have not been simultaneously optimized in previous studies, making our approach unique. Secondly, we adopt a lexicographic optimization approach to prioritize these objectives according to the company's requirements. This allows to find solutions that are optimal in terms of one objective while satisfying the constraints imposed by the other objectives. Lastly, it is proposed a novel lexicographic multi-objective genetic algorithm, which extends the traditional single-objective genetic algorithm, to effectively solve large-sized problems. Overall, our study not only addresses a real-life problem in the textile industry but also introduces innovative techniques and approaches for optimizing multiple objectives in a scheduling context. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The outbreak of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) has changed the lives of most people on Earth. Given the high prevalence of this disease, its correct diagnosis in order to quarantine patients is of the utmost importance in the steps of fighting this pandemic. Among the various modalities used for diagnosis, medical imaging, especially computed tomography (CT) imaging, has been the focus of many previous studies due to its accuracy and availability. In addition, automation of diagnostic methods can be of great help to physicians. In this paper, a method based on pre-trained deep neural networks is presented, which, by taking advantage of a cyclic generative adversarial net (CycleGAN) model for data augmentation, has reached state-of-the-art performance for the task at hand, i.e., 99.60% accuracy. Also, in order to evaluate the method, a dataset containing 3163 images from 189 patients has been collected and labeled by physicians. Unlike prior datasets, normal data have been collected from people suspected of having COVID-19 disease and not from data from other diseases, and this database is made available publicly. Moreover, the method's reliability is further evaluated by calibration metrics, and its decision is interpreted by Grad-CAM also to find suspicious regions as another output of the method and make its decisions trustworthy and explainable.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The need for effective electronic waste (e-waste) management practices has received wide attention due to increased societal awareness; however, the existence of challenges adds difficulties. This study identifies these critical e-waste management challenges through extensive literature reviews and targeted interaction with e-waste recycling units, and our work suggests strategies for e-waste mitigation. Then, an integrated framework of four methods - Fermatean fuzzy set (FFS), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), and Technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) - calculates the weightage of the challenges, depicts causal interrelationships among the challenges, and ranks the mitigation strategies. For India, the top five most critical challenges to e-waste management practices include the booming informal sector, illegal import of e-waste, lack of technical expertise, absence of guidelines for e-waste recycling, and lack of data inventory. India's governmental establishment of an infrastructure for modern e-waste management represents the best potential strategy. Understanding the causal interrelationship and weightage of the challenges may help policymakers, industrial practitioners, and government agencies streamline e-waste management activities. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the rapid development of science and technology, large-scale global optimization (LSGO) has received more and more attention. However, large-scale problem is very challenging due to its high dimensionality, nonlinearity, and countless local optimal solutions. In this paper, a space-reduction based three-phase approach (SRTP) is proposed to solve this problem. In the first phase, a space reduction based line search method is designed to roughly locate good solutions as well as to explore important information such as promising search regions and characteristics of each variable (dimension). In the second phase, a multi-grouping strategy is proposed for fully non-separable largescale problems. This new decomposition method provides dozens of grouping results for non-separable large-scale problems that not only reduces the dimensionality but also maintains the correlation of variables to the most extent. Then in the third phase, a space-reduction based group search method is designed to optimize the sub-groups. By decomposing the large-scale problem as well as reducing the huge search space to focus on promising areas, this group search method can gain better efficiency. Experiments are conducted on 35 widely used benchmark functions and the proposed SRTP is compared with state-of-the-art LSGO algorithms.

ID REGRESSION
AB Due to the unique construction module and design of graph neural networks (GNNs), neural archi-tecture search (NAS) methods specifically for GNNs have become a promising research hotspot in recent years. Among the existing methods, one class of methods microscopically searches for the constituent components of network layers. However, most of them ignore the topology connections between network layers or the feature fusion strategies. Another class of methods, called differentiable architecture search methods, has the advantage of searching topology connections and feature fusion strategies. However, constrained by the requirement of predefining all candidate operations, these methods can only sample a limited number of network layers. In this paper, we propose a surrogate evolutionary graph neural architecture search (GNAS) algorithm whose search space contains not only the microscopic network layer components but also topology connections and feature fusion strategies (called CTFGNAS). The GNN sampled in CTFGNAS is represented by a simple one-dimensional vector and does not fix the network depth. To address the problem that traditional crossover and mutation operators applied to GNAS may produce illegal solutions, we design a repair operation to guarantee the legitimacy of the solutions. The network depth is also increased with a large probability in the mutation operation to alleviate the oversmoothing problem. In addition, to cope with the challenge of computational resources due to the increased search space, we form a surrogate model with three classical regression models, where only a small number of solutions are truly evaluated for their fitness, and the remaining large number of solutions are predicted for their fitness by the surrogate model. Finally, experiments are executed on six widely used real-world datasets. The experimental results illustrate that CTFGNAS obtains more effective results than the state-of-the-art handcrafted GNNs and GNAS methods on all datasets. CTFGNAS is now available on the following website: https://github.com/chnyliu/CTFGNAS.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Information spread is an intriguing topic to study in network science, which investigates how information, influence, or contagion propagate through networks. Graph burning is a simplified deterministic model for how information spreads within networks. The complicated NP-complete nature of the problem makes it computationally difficult to solve using exact algorithms. Accordingly, a number of heuristics and approximation algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the graph burning problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm called Centrality BAsed Geneticalgorithm (CBAG) for solving the graph burning problem. Considering the unique characteristics of the graph burning problem, we introduce novel genetic operators, chromosome representation, and evaluation method. In the proposed algorithm, the well-known betweenness centrality is used as the backbone of our chromosome initialization procedure. The proposed algorithm is implemented and compared with previous heuristics and approximation algorithms on 15 benchmark graphs of different sizes. Based on the results, it can be seen that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in comparison to the previous state-of-the-art heuristics. The complete source code is available online and can be used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for the graph burning problem. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the optimization of constrained type problems, the main difficulty is the elimination of the constraint violations in the evolutionary search process. Evolutionary algorithms are designed by default according to the requirements of unconstrained and continuous global optimization problems. Since there are no constraint functions in these type of problems, the constraint violations are not considered in the design of the guiding mechanism of evolutionary algorithms. In this study, two new methods were introduced to redesign the evolutionary algorithms in accordance with the requirements of constrained optimization problems. These were (i) constraint space-based, called Fitness-Distance -Constraint (FDC), selection method and (ii) dynamic guiding mechanism. Firstly, thanks to the FDC guide selection method, the constraint violation values of the individuals in the population were converted into score values and the individuals who increase the diversity in the search process were selected as guide. On the other hand, in dynamic guiding mechanism, the FDC method was applied in case of constraint violation, otherwise the default guide selection method was used The proposed methods were used to redesign the guiding mechanism of adaptive guided differential evolution (AGDE), a current evolutionary algorithm, and the FDC-AGDE algorithm was designed. The performance of the FDC-AGDE was tested on eleven different constrained real-world optimization problems. The results of the FDC-AGDE and AGDE were evaluated using the Friedman and Wilcoxon test methods. According to Wilcoxon pairwise results, the FDC-AGDE showed better performance than the AGDE in nine of the eleven problems and equal performance in two of the eleven problems. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was compared with the competitive and up-to-date MHS algorithms in terms of the results of Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, feasibility rate, and success rate. According to Friedman test results, the first three algorithms were the FDC-AGDE, LSHADE-SPACMA, and AGDE algorithms with the score of 2.69, 4.05, and 4.34, respectively. According to the mean values of the success rates obtained from the eleven problems, the FDC-AGDE, LSHADE-SPACMA, and AGDE algorithms ranked in the first three with the success rates of 67%, 48% and 28%, respectively. Consequently, the FDC-AGDE algorithm showed a superior performance comparing with the competing MHS algorithms. According to the results, it is expected that the proposed methods will be widely used in the constrained optimization problems in the future.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the potential harm to public health as well as the environment, medical waste treatment have emerged as a critical concern, especially in developing nations. The selection of a suitable medical waste treatment technique (MWTT) is now characterized as a critical multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem because of the incorporation of several competing criteria. This study provides a hybrid MCDM technique for assessing MWTTs concerning social, environmental, economic, and technical criteria in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) is a potent tool for expressing ambiguous and vague information efficiently and has proven effective for MCDM problems. In IFS environment a new distance measure and an entropy measure (EM) are introduced by employing the generalized Csiszar f-divergence measure, which are further used to construct the MCDM algorithm. The introduced entropy measure is used to examine the objective weights of criteria, and the distance measure is employed to construct the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) for the assessment of the alternatives. Furthermore, the significance of the criteria for the proposed MCDM technique is evaluated by integrated weights (combining objective and subjective weights). The Stepwise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) technique is used to obtain the subjective weights for criteria. Thus, a hybrid MCDM technique, namely IF-EM-SWARA-TOPSIS, is developed. To exhibit the effectiveness and applicability of the suggested framework, a MWTT selection problem in Indian context is depicted. The comparative study and sensitivity assessment are conducted to show the sustainability and stability of the proposed IF-EM-SWARA-TOPSIS technique for ranking the preference order of the MWTTs. Moreover, the practical implications of the proposed method are discussed. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) has always been a typical issue in India. The rapid population growth, impetuous adoption of modern lifestyle, and fast urbanization resulted in India's swift generation of complicated municipal solid waste (MSW). Consequently, municipalities of different cities in India face various difficulties in MSW collection, treatment and disposal methodology. Inefficient or poorly managed MSW causes numerous troubles, including air pollution, soil fouling, contamination in drinking water and health hazard, and it also impacts socio-economic deterioration. MSWM technique selection is based on several criteria, which are generally imprecise, uncertain, and vague. This paper uses the cubic Pythagorean fuzzy number to comprise the fuzzy characteristics of the criteria value concerning the five alternatives (Thermochemical methods in MSW treatment and disposal). The best MSW treatment and disposal method is selected amongst the five alternatives under the novel multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) approach, the cubic Pythagorean fuzzy EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) in the Indian context. The weight information of the criteria has yet to be wholly known. A non-linear optimization scheme is proposed to determine the criteria weights that are partially known to maximize the generalized total distance measure between alternatives corresponding to all criteria. The present method is explained with a case study. Finally, a comparative analysis is drawn between the present and some existing methods, showing that the present method is consistent and robust enough to apply in practice.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the context of the "Internet +"era, the shipping industry, which is struggling to survive due to economic weakness and excess capacity, is also actively seeking transformation to enhance core competitiveness of enterprises. This paper embeds the evolutionary game theory in the pricing model to explore the dynamic interaction mechanism between shipping companies and freight forwarders in channel selection. The conditions for shipping companies to choose different channel strategies in the long-term dynamic evolution process are derived. Then, we apply system dynamics to simulate the evolution model, and analyzes the influence of factors such as channel preference, operating cost and perceived loss on the dynamic evolution process. It is concluded that shipping companies and forwarders have different channel choices at different development stages, and when shipping companies choose to invade online platform, forwarders are motivated to choose online channel to obtain lower freight rates. When the channel preference of forwarders is moderate, the two channels coexist; when the channel preference of forwarders is high, the final stabilization strategy evolves to only the online channel. Furthermore, the channel preference of shippers has a greater impact on the evolutionary mechanism than that of forwarders. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMMUNITY DETECTION
AB The development of computational intelligence based approaches for the compression of graphs is an under-explored area of research. Further, compression of weighted graphs is significantly more complicated than compression of unweighted graphs. In this paper a multi-objective approach using NSGA-II is applied to the problem of weighted graph compression. The approach is designed to find a balance between the level of compression and the distortion created by the compression. Distortion is measured using two fitness functions that each evaluate changes both in graph structure and in edge weights. The methodology is applied to three weighted contact networks with differing characteristics. It was found that the multi-objective approach is useful in identifying suitable compression ratios based upon defined levels of acceptable distortion, with a single-objective genetic algorithm then applied to focus on this target compression ratio to further reduce distortion.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Environmental pollution and social inequalities have prompted the agricultural industry to implement sustainable supply chain management practices. However, supply chain operations and planning in developing countries such as Iran are often not economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable. To address this challenge, this paper presents a practical optimization model for sustainable closed loop supply chain (SCLSC) management in the agricultural industry of Iran, with a focus on the olive crop. Based on the triple bottom line concept, which considers economic, environmental, and social sustainability, the proposed model makes location, allocation, and inventory decisions under uncertainty by developing a scenario-based robust optimization model. To solve this complex network design problem, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm with a multi-neighborhood procedure that efficiently handles the complexity of the problem. Specifically, we develop a customized Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm using a tabu list to improve the initial solution found by a constructive heuristic algorithm. Our extensive analysis and comparison of our metaheuristic algorithm against the exact solver and two other powerful metaheuristic algorithms demonstrate the applicability of our SCLSC model for the agricultural industry in Iran and the high performance of the proposed metaheuristic algorithm for solving large-scale networks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The determination of characteristic points of bioimpedance curves is crucial to the analysis of bioimpedance signals. Traditional methods need to calculate the derivative of the bioimpedance curve and rely on the help of other simultaneously recorded signals. However, these methods are sensitive to noise while some auxiliary signal may be unrecorded. A novel approach is proposed in this study to automatically determine the positions of characteristic points. The overall development process is realized as a two-phase construct. The first stage of the process involves a fitting of the impedance change curves using nonlinear regression models. Then, a prediction model is trained to predict the positions of characteristic points through a linear combination of the parameters of the nonlinear regression model. Experimental studies constructed on a collection of real-world bioimpedance signals help quantify the performance of the algorithm and gain a deep insight into the superiority of the proposed methodology. It is shown that the proposed method offers a substantial improvement in the prediction accuracy in comparison with the baseline method. Moreover, the proposed characteristic point determination method is robust to noise since its performance is not affected in the presence of noise.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Learning from hybrid labels is suitable for dealing with the real-world scenario, where the labels of the training dataset include fine-grained labels and coarse-grained labels. Unfortunately, obtaining fine-grained labels with strong supervision information is difficult. Compared with the more difficult to-obtain fine-grained labels, it is labor-saving and efficient for the annotator to remove several impossible options to obtain partial labels, which also provide more information than coarse-grained labels. Nonetheless, the goal of existing methods of PLL is only to learn from partially labeled data but cannot utilize fine-grained labels, coarse-grained labels, and partial labels to train an ordinary supervised classifier. In this paper, we propose a novel setting called learning from hybrid labels with partial labels (LHLP) and propose a method to learn a classifier for identifying difficult-to recognize images by using hybrid labels with partial labels. Specifically, we drive hybrid-grained contrast regularization (HGCR) for exploring the relationship between sample labels, which uses finegrained label information and coarse-grained label information to disambiguate labels respectively. Extensive experiments on benchmark validate the effectiveness of the proposed method HGCR in LHLP, compare to the state-of-art methods on the CIFAR-100, Kuzushiji-MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, our method achieves promising results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID PULSE TRANSIT-TIME
AB The regression and classification performances of deep-learning algorithms depend on the tuning of the model and require significant intervention to train the model. A blood pressure prediction (BP) method - which is an improved cascade forest regression method based on a deep forest framework - is proposed in this study to mitigate the adverse effects of hyperparameters on deep learning algorithms and human errors. The impact of hyperparameters on the model can be reduced using random forest regression and extra tree regression as base estimators and by applying them to bootstrap aggregation strategies for learning data. The photoplethysmography (PPG) data and ambulatory blood pressure obtained from the MIMIC II database were evenly divided into 5 s segments to accurately estimate blood pressure. Nonlinear indices of the time domain, frequency domain, and heart rate variability were obtained from the PPG signal as training characteristic values. This process is similar to collecting data directly from a wearable device for rapid blood pressure prediction. This improves the predictive performance of the model and reduces additional memory consumption. Our proposed algorithm achieved mean absolute errors of 1.760 and 2.896 mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. Additionally, our best model achieved R2 scores of 0.948 and 0.926 for SBP and DBP, respectively. According to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standards, the standard deviation and mean error of the predicted results for systolic and diastolic BPs were within the standard range. According to the British Hypertension Society standard, the results of the proposed algorithm reached grade A. This study confirmed the possibility of developing an algorithm that can accurately estimate blood pressure. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aiming at the problem that conventional trackers are difficult to adapt to abrupt motion, a tracking algorithm based on a synergy of the adaptive whale optimization algorithm and differential evolution (AWOA-DE) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the non-linear dynamic feedback strategy based on the one-fifth principle is employed to replace the linear mechanism, which is the variation of exploring step in the basic whale optimization algorithm (WOA), and an adaptive WOA (AWOA) is generated to improve the global optimization ability of the WOA. Secondly, AWOA adopts a random sampling strategy to generate new samples, which could ensure the diversity of solutions, but may lead to instability. By mixing AWOA and DE algorithms, the population is divided into two groups, which are updated by AWOA and DE algorithms respectively, to ensure the diversity of the populations and improve the optimization accuracy of the algorithm. Finally, a visual tracker based on AWOA-DE is proposed, which can deal with the problem of abrupt motion in tracking. In addition, the effectiveness of the hybrid optimization algorithm is evaluated using 23 benchmark functions. In the experiment of visual tracking, extensive experimental results show that the AWOA-DE tracker (AWOADET) has much stronger competitiveness compared to the WOA tracker (WOAT) and the other 10 state-of-the-art trackers, especially for abrupt motion tracking. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Borrowers' default is the main risk of online lending. Using credit scoring model to assess borrowers' credit is an important means to reduce default risk. The existing related work focus on the improve-ment of assessment methods, and do not study the quality of credit data enough. Actually, there are usually some noisy, redundant or irrelevant features in online credit data, which increase the computational complexity and reduce the evaluation accuracy of the model. Well-performing feature selection method is the key premise to improve accuracy of the credit evaluation model. At present, the feature selection methods applied to online credit scoring generally have shortcomings such as subjectivity, time consuming, low accuracy, etc. So it is urgent to introduce new schemes. Among the feature selection schemes in many fields, heuristic algorithm is widely recognized because of its advantages of high efficiency and accuracy, and especially BinSSA is an outstanding representative. However, BinSSA has the defects that it is easy to form extreme distribution in initialization, and is inefficient because there is a high probability of falling into local optimum during iteration. So it is still not the best choice for feature selection in online lending credit scoring model. In this paper, we propose a local binary social spider algorithm (LBSA), which introduces two local optimization strategies into BinSSA: opposition-based learning (OBL) and improved local search algorithm (ILSA). These strategies can help to improve the above defects. We conduct comparative experiments based on three typical online credit data sets and different algorithms, to verify the superior performance of LBSA. The experimental results validate that LBSA greatly reduces the redundancy of returned feature subsets, improves the iterative stability, and makes the credit scoring model more accurate and effective. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Cluster analysis discovers natural structures from different perspectives of data objects and has become an effective method in data mining. The emergence of semi-supervised clustering techniques has improved the performance of unsupervised clustering algorithms. Clustering with guidance informa-tion is a clustering method variant that uses pairwise constraints based on background knowledge. This method increases the interpretability of the results through a knowledge-guided perspective but simultaneously suffers from the problem of constraint conflict. This paper designs knowledge augmentation-based soft constraints as a new pairwise constraint representation and proposes a Soft Constraints Kmeans (SCop-Kmeans) method to resolve constraint conflicts. By describing constraint knowledge from multiple perspectives, the association strength of pairwise constraints is calculated to obtain the assignment basis of objects. SCop-Kmeans can solve the sample allocation conflict problem caused by the contradiction between different constraints and improve the clustering stability. Finally, experiments are performed using UCI public standard datasets. The proposed method further improves the accuracy of clustering and performs well in experiments with different numbers of constraints, which shows that the proposed method has advantages in using constraint information to guide clustering.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Continuous ant colony optimization was a population-based heuristic search algorithm inspired by the pathfinding behavior of ant colonies with a simple structure and few control parameters. However, in the case of multimodal and high-dimensional optimization problems, it was often limited to local regions in the feasible domain space, negatively affecting the computational effort required to find the optimal solution point. To alleviate its limitations in this regard, a random following strategy is proposed to enhance communication among the ant colony search agent and other ant colony members within the search dimension. The proposed algorithm that incorporates this strategy is called Random Following Ant Colony Optimization. Then, to evaluate the global optimization performance of the proposed algorithm, the well-known numerical optimization problem, namely the Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2017 test suite, is used. First, the proposed algorithm's parameters are analyzed for sensitivity, scalability experiments, and balanced diversity. Second, it is compared experimentally with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms in dimensions 10, 30, 50, and 100, respectively, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Friedman test, and Bonferroni-Dunn post-hoc statistical test are used to synthesize the experimental comparison results. Finally, to evaluate the ability of the proposed algorithm to handle discrete feature selection problems, comparative experiments are conducted on 24 datasets with eight well-known classification methods and five high-performance classification methods. The benchmark test results show that the global optimization performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to the winners of the test suite in 50 and 100 dimensions. The results of the feature selection experiments show that the proposed algorithm is much stronger than the well-known and high-performance classification methods on high-dimensional datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Logical argumentation is a well-known approach to modeling non-monotonic reasoning with conflicting information. In this paper we provide a comprehensive postulate-based study of properties of logical argumentation frameworks and a full characterization of their semantics and inference relations. In this way we identify well-behaved formal argumentative models of drawing logically justified inferences from a given set of possibly conflicting defeasible, as well as strict assumptions. Given some desiderata in terms of rationality postulates, we consider the conditions that an argumentation framework should fulfill for the desiderata to hold. One purpose of this approach is to assist designers to "plug-in" pre-defined formalisms according to actual needs. To this end, we present a classification of argumentation frameworks relative to the types of attacks they implement. In turn, for each class we determine which desiderata are satisfied. Our study is highly abstract, supposing only a minimal set of requirements on the considered underlying deductive systems, and in this way covering a broad range of formalisms, including classical, intuitionistic and modal logics. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

TI Detecting broiler chickens on litter floor with the YOLOv5-CBAM deep

ID POULTRY
AB For commercial broiler production, about 20,000-30,000 birds are raised in each confined house, which has caused growing public concerns on animal welfare. Currently, daily evaluation of broiler wellbeing and growth is conducted manually, which is labor-intensive and subjectively subject to human error. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic tool to detect and analyze the behaviors of chickens and predict their wel-fare status. In this study, we developed a YOLOv5-CBAM-broiler model and tested its performance for de-tecting broilers on litter floor. The proposed model consisted of two parts: (1) basic YOLOv5 model for bird or broiler feature extraction and object detection; and (2) the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to improve the feature extraction capability of the network and the problem of missed detection of occluded targets and small targets. A complex dataset of broiler chicken images at different ages, multiple pens and scenes (fresh litter versus reused litter) was constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of the new model. In addition, the model was compared to the Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3, EfficientDet and YOLOv5 models. The results demonstrate that the precision, recall, F1 score and an mAP@0.5 of the proposed method were 97.3%, 92.3%, 94.7%, and 96.5%, which were superior to the comparison models. In addition, comparing the detection effects in different scenes, the YOLOv5-CBAM model was still better than the com-parison method. Overall, the proposed YOLOv5-CBAM-broiler model can achieve real-time accurate and fast target detection and provide technical support for the management and monitoring of birds in commer-cial broiler houses.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Deep Learning (DL), a type of Machine Learning, has gained significant interest in many fields, including agriculture. This paper aims to shed light on deep learning techniques used in agriculture for abiotic and biotic stress detection in fruits and vegetables, their benefits, and the challenges faced by users. Scientific papers were collected from Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Springer, and Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) using combinations of specific keywords such as:'Deep Learning' OR'Artificial Intelligence' in combination with fruit disease', vegetable disease', 'fruit stress', OR 'vegetable stress' following PRISMA guidelines. From the initial 818 papers identified using the keywords, 132 were reviewed after excluding books, reviews, and the irrelevant. The recovered scientific papers were from 2003 to 2022; 93 % addressed biotic stress on fruits and vegetables. The most common biotic stresses on species are fungal diseases (grey spots, brown spots, black spots, downy mildew, powdery mildew, and anthracnose). Few studies were interested in abiotic stresses (nutrient deficiency, water stress, light intensity, and heavy metal contamination). Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks were the most used keywords, with GoogleNet (18.28%), ResNet50 (16.67%), and VGG16 (16.67%) as the most used architectures. Fifty-two percent of the data used to compile these models come from the fields, followed by data obtained online. Precision problems due to unbalanced classes and the small size of some databases were also analyzed. We provided the research gaps and some perspectives from the reviewed papers. Further research works are required fora deep understanding of the use of machine learning techniques in fruit and vegetable studies: collection of large datasets according to different scenarios on fruit and vegetable diseases, evaluation of the effect of climatic variability on the fruit and vegetable yield using AI methods and more abiotic stress studies. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a newly discovered viral disease from the SARS-CoV-2 family. This has caused a moral panic resulting in the spread of informative and uninformative information about COVID-19 and its effects. Twitter is a popular social media platform used extensively during the current outbreak. This paper aims to predict informative tweets related to COVID-19 on Twitter using a novel set of fuzzy rules involving deep learning techniques. This study focuses on identifying informative tweets during the pandemic to provide the public with trustworthy information and forecast how quickly diseases could spread. In this case, we have implemented RoBERTa and CT-BERT models using the fuzzy methodology to identify COVID-19 patient tweets. The proposed architecture combines deep learning transformer models RoBERTa and CT-BERT with the fuzzy technique to categorize posts as INFORMATIVE or UNINFORMATIVE. We performed a comparative analysis of our method with machine learning models and deep learning approaches. The results show that our proposed model can classify informative and uninformative tweets with an accuracy of 91.40% and an F1-score of 91.94% using the COVID-19 English tweet dataset. The proposed model is accurate and ready for real-world application.

AB This work investigates the combination of different feedback linearization strategies with a reference governor scheme, i.e., a specific control scheme that enables the handling of constraint and limit protection, developed in a zonotopic framework. The zonotopic representation of the safe flight envelope is simple and computationally efficient for real-time implementation. The global scheme consisting of feedback linearization and reference governor ensures safe flight under disturbances and constraints, as illustrated with numerical tests using the Parrot Mambo simulator provided in the Mathworks Simulink environment. Discussions of trajectory tracking, input constraints and robustness to modeling uncertainties are included.

The application of DNDI is new in the context of asymmetric bipartite consensus, and it inherits all the advantages of NDI and works efficiently to solve the asymmetric bipartite problem. The mathematical details presented provide theoretical proof of its efficiency. A realistic simulation study is performed to establish the claims.

ID TOPOLOGICAL DESCRIPTORS
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been employed in materials research to predict physical and functional properties, and have achieved superior performance in several application domains over prior machine learning approaches. Recent studies incorporate features of increasing complexity such as Gaussian radial functions, plane wave functions, and angular terms to augment the neural network models, with the expectation that these features are critical for achieving a high performance. Here, we propose a GNN that adopts edge convolution where hidden edge features evolve during training and extensive attention mechanisms, and operates on simple graphs with atoms as nodes and distances between them as edges. As a result, the same model can be used for very different tasks as no other domain-specific features are used. With a model that uses no feature engineering, we achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art models with elaborate features for formation energy and band gap prediction with standard benchmarks; we achieve even better performance when the dataset size increases. Although some domain-specific datasets still require hand-crafted features to achieve state-of-the-art results, our selected architecture choices greatly reduce the need for elaborate feature engineering and still maintain predictive power in comparison.

AB RGB-D semantic segmentation is crucial for robots to understand scenes. Most existing methods take depth information as an additional input, leading to cross-modal semantic segmentation networks that cannot achieve the purpose of multi-scale global and local cross-modal feature complementation. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal attention fusion network for RGB-D semantic segmentation. Specifically, we adopt a coordinate attention feature interaction module (CA-FIM) to aggregate RGB and depth features at the spatial and channel levels through the coordinate attention mechanism. Then, the gated cross-attention feature fusion module (GC-FFM) fuses the expanded modal features to achieve cross-modal global inference by the gated cross-attention mechanism. Utilizing the above two modules in four stages of the network, our framework can learn multi-modal and multi-level information to reduce the uncertainty of the final prediction. Extensive experiments on the NYU Depth V2, SUN RGB-D, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our cross-modal attention fusion network is effective in RGB-D semantic segmentation for various complicated scenes. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sequential recommendation predicts the items that the user may interact with next based on the time -series information of the user-item interactions, and learns the users' dynamic preferences. However, most existing sequential recommendation models ignore the micro-behaviors and the importance of attribute information. Thus, we propose a new model named Sequential Recommendation Model Integrating Micro-behaviors and Attribute Enhancement (SRMA). First, we build a user-item interaction graph and a user-item-attribute interaction graph by introducing user and item attributes. In addition, we perform the temporal attention embedding propagation in the user-item interaction graph, in which the multi-head attention is used to learn the temporal neighborhood weights under micro-behaviors. Simultaneously, we perform the attribute attention embedding propagation in the user-item-attribute interaction graph, which learns the high-hop interactions among users, items and attributes under micro-behaviors, and assigns different weights to attributes through the attribute attention. Finally, the prediction is made by combining the embedding of each layer in the two graphs. Experiments on two real datasets show that the model has good performance.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The learning of high-quality stock representations is one of the keys to predicting stock movements effectively. Current studies have been negatively impacted by stochasticity in stock prices, resulting in inadequate representation learnt by the models. We present an end-to-end stock movement prediction framework (CLSR) utilizing contrastive learning to exploit the correlation between intra-day data and enhance stock representation in order to improve the accuracy of stock movement prediction. In addition, a hybrid encoding network is developed to extract long-range dependencies and local contextual features in stock data, making the feature representation more complete. To further improve the prediction accuracy of the model, historical state information is added to the intra-day stock data. Our experiments on CSI-500 show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions. The proposed method is also validated by analyzing the representation space thoroughly.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problems have drawn general attention from scholars. The distribution linguistic preference relation (DLPR) is a flexible and practical tool to describe the preferences of decision makers (DMs) in the decision-making process. Opinion conflict is inevitable among large-scale DMs due to self-interest and individual perception. Thus, it is essential to establish a consensus reaching process (CRP), but there may be non-cooperative behaviors for DMs when they are required to accept the opinions adjustment. As the social network becomes more ubiquitous, moreover, the trust relationship among decision members has implications for the consensus reaching process. Hence, this study proposes a new consensus model that manages non-cooperative behaviors from the cooperative degree, trust relationship, and individual self-confidence level three aspects, and discusses the specific influence of these factors on the penalty for non-cooperative behaviors. In addition, hesitancy-based similarity measure of linguistic distributed assessment is proposed for clustering and measuring consensus level. Finally, a numerical example of a price hearing system demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method, and a comparative analysis illustrates its features and advantages.

AB Malignant Mesothelioma is a difficult to diagnose and highly lethal cancer usually associated with asbestos exposure. It can be broadly classified into three subtypes: Epithelioid, Sarcomatoid, and a hybrid Biphasic subtype in which significant components of both of the previous subtypes are present. Early diagnosis and identification of the subtype informs treatment and can help improve patient outcome. However, the subtyping of malignant mesothelioma, and specifically the recognition of transitional features from routine histology slides has a high level of inter-observer variability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end multiple instance learning (MIL) approach for malignant mesothe-lioma subtyping. This uses an adaptive instance-based sampling scheme for training deep convolutional neural networks on bags of image patches that allows learning on a wider range of relevant instances compared to max or top-N based MIL approaches. We also investigate augmenting the instance representation to include aggregate cellular morphology features from cell segmentation. The proposed MIL approach enables identifica-tion of malignant mesothelial subtypes of specific tissue regions. From this a continuous characterisation of a sample according to predominance of sarcomatoid vs epithelioid regions is possible, thus avoiding the arbitrary and highly subjective categorisation by currently used subtypes. Instance scoring also enables studying tumor heterogeneity and identifying patterns associated with different subtypes. We have evaluated the proposed method on a dataset of 234 tissue micro-array cores with an AUROC of 0.89 & PLUSMN;0.05 for this task. The dataset and developed methodology is available for the community at: https://github.com/measty/PINS.

AB Previous reports show that a substantial proportion of (near) medical errors in the operating theatre is attributable to ineffective communication between healthcare professionals. Speaking up about observed medical errors is a safety behaviour which promotes effective communication between health care professionals, consequently optimising patient care by reducing medical error risk. Speaking up by healthcare professionals (e. g., nurses, residents) remains difficult to execute in practice despite increasing awareness of its importance. Therefore, this paper discourses a computational model concerning the mechanisms known from psychological, observational, and medical literature which underlie the speaking up behaviour of a health care professional. It also addresses how a doctor may respond to the communicated message. Through several scenarios we illustrate what pattern of factors causes a healthcare professional to speak up when witnessing a (near) medical error. We moreover demonstrate how introducing an observant agent can facilitate effective communication and help to ensure patient safety through speaking up when a nurse can not. In conclusion, the current paper introduces an adaptive computational model which predicts speaking up behaviour from the perspective of the speaker and receiver, with the addition of a virtual coach to further optimise patient safety when a patient could be in harm's way.

AB Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), as an increasingly essential application, can provide accurate responses to user queries. ensuring that users obtain relevant information and make decisions promptly. The deep learning-based approaches have achieved satisfactory QA results by leveraging the neural network models. However, these approaches require numerous parameters, which increases the workload of tuning model parameters. To address this problem, we propose BT-CKBQA, a practical and highly efficient approach incorporating BM25 and Template-based predicate mapping for CKBQA. Besides, a concept lattice based approach is proposed for summarizing the knowledge base, which can largely improve the execution efficiency of QA with little loss of performance. Concretely, BT-CKBQA leverages the BM25 algorithm and custom dictionary to detect the subject of a question sentence. A template-based predicate generation approach is then proposed to generate candidate predicates. Finally, a ranking approach is provided with the joint consideration of character similarity and semantic similarity for predicate mapping. Extensive experiments are conducted over the NLPCC-ICCPOL 2016 and 2018 KBQA datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the compared baselines. Particularly, the averaged F1-score result of BT-CKBQA for mention detection is up to 98.25%, which outperforms the best method currently available in the literature. For question answering, the proposed approach achieves superior results than most baselines with the F1-score value of 82.68%. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, the execution efficiency and performance of QA per unit time can be improved with up to 56.39% and 44.06% gains, respectively. The experimental results for the diversification of questions indicate that the proposed approach performs better for diversified questions than domain-specific questions. The case study over a constructed COVID-19 knowledge base illustrates the effectiveness and practicability of BT-CKBQA.

AB Object detectors based on deep learning can run smoothly on a terminal device in complex traffic scenes, and the model compression method has become a research hotspot. Considering student network single learning in the knowledge distillation algorithm, the dependence on loss function design leads to parameter sensitivity and other problems, we propose a new knowledge distillation method with second-order term attention mechanisms and feature fusion of adjacent layers. First, we build a knowledge distillation framework based on YOLOv5 and propose a new attention mechanism in the teacher network backbone to extract the hot map. Then, we combine the hot map features with the next level features through the fusion module. By fusing the useful information of the low convolution layer and the feature map of the high convolution layer to help the student network obtain the final prediction map. Finally, to improve the accuracy of small objects, we add a 160 x 160 detection head and use a transformer encoder block module to replace the convolution network of the head. Sufficient experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The speed and number of parameters remain unchanged, but the average detection accuracy is 97.4% on the KITTI test set. On the Cityscapes test set, the average detection accuracy reaches 92.7%.

AB In the intelligent transportation system, traffic forecasting, which is generally characterized as a graph spatial-temporal prediction task, plays a crucial role. It is challenging to generate reliable forecast results due to the complexity of traffic topological information and the inherent uncertainty of road traffic circumstances. Existing works generally focus on modeling spatial dependency on static graph structures, but ignore dynamic relations between road segments and cannot extract long-range traffic dependencies in spatial-temporal domains. To bridge the above gaps, we present a novel framework, called Dynamic Multi-Hop Graph Attention Network (DMGAN). Specifically, we leverage dynamic graph modeling to capture time-varying relations across road sections and introduce the multi-hop operation in each message propagation layer to extract long-range spatial dependency. Meanwhile, we develop a fusion-attention module, preserving both local and global hidden layer outputs of the encoder, to capture both long- and short-term temporal dependencies jointly. In this way, our method can fully model complex time-varying traffic topology information and capture the internal patterns of traffic series by integrating dynamic graph structure and temporal attention component. DGMAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in three metrics, as demonstrated by experimental findings on four real-world public traffic datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, PEMS03, and PEMS07. This code and data are available at https://github.com/EEHITer/2022-TKDE-DMGAN-Pytorch/tree/main for reproducibility and further studies.

AB Existing contrastive methods usually learn visual representations either by maximizing instance contrast or by minimizing dimension redundancy separately, and fail to make full use of data information. In this paper, we propose an instance-dimension dual contrastive method named IDDCLR to thoroughly mine the intrinsic knowledge underlying data. It jointly optimizes the instance contrast and the dimension redundancy to learn better visual representations. Specifically, we employ the normalized temperature scaled cross entropy (NT-Xent) to formulate the instance contrast loss, and propose a dimension contrast loss function that also takes the form of NT-Xent, resulting in symmetric form of the whole loss. The significance of minimizing the loss is twofold: On the one hand, it learns effective visual representations in the latent space, where the agreement between differently augmented views of the same instance is maximized. On the other hand, it minimizes the redundancy among feature dimensions, consequently being capable of avoiding trivial embeddings. Experimental results show that IDDCLR outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on classification tasks, and performs comparably on transfer learning tasks.

ID SVM
AB Multi-view learning aims to make use of the advantages of different views to complement each other and fully mines the potential information in the data. However, the complexity of multi-view learning algorithm is much higher than that of single view learning algorithm. Based on the optimality conditions of two classical multi-view models: SVM-2K and multi-view twin support vector machine (MvTwSVM), this paper analyzes the corresponding relationship between dual variables and samples, and derives their safe screening rules for the first time, termed as SSR-SVM-2K and SSR-MvTwSVM. It can assign or delete four groups of different dual variables in advance before solving the optimization problem, so as to greatly reduce the scale of the optimization problem and improve the solution speed. More importantly, the safe screening criterion is "safe", that is, the solution of the reduced optimization problem is the same as that of the original problem before screening. In addition, we further give a sequence screening rule to speed up the parameter optimization process, and analyze its properties, including the similarities and differences of safe screening rules between multi-view SVMs and single-view SVMs, the computational complexity, and the relationship between the parameter interval and screening rate. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Multi-input CNN; Face analysis; Deep learning
AB Face-based recognition methods usually need the image of the whole face to perform, but in some situations, only a fraction of the face is visible, for example wearing sunglasses or recently with the COVID pandemic we had to wear facial masks. In this work, we propose a network architecture made up of four deep learning streams that process each one a different face element, namely: mouth, nose, eyes, and eyebrows, followed by a feature merge layer. Therefore, the face is segmented into the part of interest by means of ROI masks to keep the same input size for the four network streams. The aim is to assess the capacity of different combinations of face elements in recognizing the subject. The experiments were carried out on the Masked Face Recognition Database (M2FRED) which includes videos of 46 participants. The obtained results are 96% of recognition accuracy considering the four face elements; and 92%, 87%, and 63% of accuracy for the best combination of three, two, and one face elements respectively.

DE 3D deep learning; Point cloud understanding; Classification;
   Segmentation; Transfer learning
AB The recent trend in deep learning methods for 3D point cloud understanding is to propose increasingly sophisticated architectures either to better capture 3D geometries or by introducing possibly undesired inductive biases. Moreover, prior works introducing novel architectures compared their performance on the same domain, devoting less attention to their generalization to other domains. We argue that the ability of a model to transfer the learnt knowledge to different domains is an important feature that should be evaluated to exhaustively assess the quality of a deep network architecture. In this work we propose PatchMixer, a simple yet effective architecture that extends the ideas behind the recent MLP-Mixer paper to 3D point clouds. The novelties of our approach are the processing of local patches instead of the whole shape to promote robustness to partial point clouds, and the aggregation of patch-wise features using an MLP as a simpler alternative to the graph convolutions or the attention mechanisms that are used in prior works. We evaluated our method on the shape classification and part segmentation tasks, achieving superior generalization performance compared to a selection of the most relevant deep architectures.

SO IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING

DE Action recognition; Motion accumulation; Selective network; Motion
ID REPRESENTATION
AB Numerous studies have highlighted the crucial role of motion information in accurate action recognition in videos. However, current methods heavily rely on temporal differences of features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to represent motion, which may have two potential limitations: (1) incomplete representation of the moving target contour due to the difference operation, and (2) equal treatment of all extracted motion features, regardless of their relevance to the classification task, which may negatively impact performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called the Motion Accumulation and Selection Network (MAS-Net). Although our new approach also considers spatial attributes, it draws inspiration from the cumulative and selective nature of human visual attention, with a primary focus on capturing the temporal attributes of actions for recognition. Further, an motion selection module is exploited to prioritize relevant temporal features while filtering out irrelevant ones. Currently, there is a growing demand for action recognition with strong temporal information, as opposed to conventional scene-related datasets such as UCF-101 and HMDB-51. Therefore, we evaluated MAS-Net on benchmark video datasets that primarily emphasize temporal information, including Something-Something V1 & V2, Diving48, and Kinetics-400. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAS-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on Something-Something V1 & V2 and Diving48 datasets. Furthermore, when compared to other 2D CNN-based models, MAS-Net exhibits competitive results on the Kinetics-400 dataset while maintaining computational efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of MAS-Net for temporal modeling in video analysis tasks.

ID NETWORK
AB The field of human activity recognition is evolving at a quick pace. Indeed, over the last two decades, several approaches have been proposed to recognize human activities from generic videos, but still limited for daily living videos which have more characteristics that make them much more complex to manage. In fact, they present several challenges to overcome, such as; camera view variations, time information representation, inter-class variation between similar actions, fine-grained actions representation and high intra-class variation. Generally, the recognition of the action requires the extraction of spatial and temporal information in the videos. To extract temporal information, several works based on the LSTM network have been published. Although, they have proven their great potential in this field, they fail to model long range temporal information in very long video sequences. We have hence thought of using Transformer networks to propose a new pose-guided self-attention mechanism combined to 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNN) by a Bilinear Pooling Attention module (BPA) which allows the spatial-temporal skeleton features to recalibrate the RGB features for Daily Living Activity (DLA) recognition. In addition, the majority of the implemented datasets are static and do not show strong variations in movement over time. We then thought of going towards a large-scale dataset called NTU RGB+D, since it contains RGB-D human actions that evolve much more over time. The Experimental results demonstrate that our Spatial Temporal Self Attention mechanism combined to 3D CNN through BPA module (ST-SA-BPA) outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.

AB In this article, the mechanical design and analysis of a novel three-legged, agile robot with passively compliant 4-degrees-of-freedom legs, comprising a hybrid topology of serial, planar and spherical parallel structures, is presented. The design aims to combine the established principle of the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum model for energy efficient locomotion with the accuracy and strength of parallel mechanisms for manipulation tasks. The study involves several kinematics and Jacobian based analyses that specifically evaluate the application of a non-overconstrained spherical parallel manipulator as a robot hip joint, decoupling impact forces and actuation torques, suitable for the requirements of legged locomotion. The dexterity is investigated with respect to joint limits and workspace boundary contours, showing that the mechanism stays well conditioned and allows for a sufficient range of motion. Based on the functional redundancy of the constrained serial-parallel architecture it is furthermore revealed that the robot allows for the exploitation of optimal leg postures, resulting in the possible optimization of actuator load distribution and accuracy improvements. Consequently, the workspace of the robot torso as additional end-effector is investigated for the possible application of object manipulation tasks. Results reveal the existence of a sufficient volume applicable for spatial motion of the torso in the statically stable tripodal posture. In addition, a critical load estimation is derived, which yields a posture dependent performance index that evaluates the risks of overload situations for the individual actuators.

The main design objective of HART is to enable the robot to change its kinematic dimension adaptively and to drive various types of vehicles in human-centered environments. First, main technical design requirements, kinematic adjustment and ease of fabrication, which were focused during the design and building process of HART platform are introduced with the mechanical and electrical specifications of each joint and link. Second, kinematic analysis of HART's both lower and upper bodies and how the designed motion trajectories are implemented via its multiple joints in a synchronous way are provided. Third, the control system and its user interface which enable the full-sized humanoid to execute various material handling tasks, such as vehicle driving in this study, are described. Then, test and evaluation processes of the built platform are shown through kinematic adaptability experiments using off-the-shelf vehicles with different sizes. Last, driving capability of HART is demonstrated by experimentations in real world settings which include both indoor and outdoor environments.

AB Real-time estimation of actual object depth is an essential module for various autonomous system tasks such as 3D reconstruction, scene understanding and condition assessment. During the last decade of machine learning, extensive deployment of deep learning methods to computer vision tasks has yielded approaches that succeed in achieving realistic depth synthesis out of a simple RGB modality. Most of these models are based on paired RGB-depth data and/or the availability of video sequences and stereo images. However, the lack of RGB-depth pairs, video sequences, or stereo images makes depth estimation a challenging task that needs to be explored in more detail. This study builds on recent advances in the field of generative neural networks in order to establish fully unsupervised single-shot depth estimation. Two generators for RGB-to-depth and depth-to-RGB transfer are implemented and simultaneously optimized using the Wasserstein-1 distance, a novel perceptual reconstruction term, and hand-crafted image filters. We comprehensively evaluate the models using a custom-generated industrial surface depth data set as well as the Texas 3D Face Recognition Database, the CelebAMask-HQ database of human portraits and the SURREAL dataset that records body depth. For each evaluation dataset, the proposed method shows a significant increase in depth accuracy compared to state-of-the-art single-image transfer methods.

TI EPC-DARTS: Efficient partial channel connection for differentiable

DE Neural architecture search; Partial channel connection; Efficient
   channel attention
AB With weight-sharing and continuous relaxation strategies, the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) proposes a fast and effective solution to perform neural network architecture search in various deep learning tasks. However, unresolved issues, such as the inefficient memory utilization, and the poor stability of the search architecture due to channels randomly selected, which has even caused performance collapses, are still perplexing researchers and practitioners. In this paper, a novel efficient channel attention mechanism based on partial channel connection for differentiable neural architecture search, termed EPC-DARTS, is proposed to address these two issues. Specifically, we design an efficient channel attention module, which is applied to capture cross-channel interactions and assign weight based on channel importance, to dramatically improve search efficiency and reduce memory occupation. Moreover, only partial channels with higher weights in the mixed calculation of operation are used through the efficient channel attention mechanism, and thus unstable network architectures obtained by the random selection operation can also be avoided in the proposed EPC-DARTS. Experimental results show that the proposed EPC-DARTS achieves remarkably competitive performance (CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100: a test accuracy rate of 97.60%/84.02%), compared to other state-of-the-art NAS methods using only 0.2 GPU-Days.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Under spatially averaged measurements (SAMs) and deception attacks, this article mainly studies the problem of extended dissipativity output synchronization of delayed reaction-diffusion neural networks via an adaptive event-triggered sampled-data (AETSD) control strategy. Compared with the existing ETSD control methods with constant thresholds, our scheme can be adaptively adjusted according to the current sampling and latest transmitted signals and is realized based on limited sensors and actuators. Firstly, an AETSD control scheme is proposed to save the limited transmission channel. Secondly, some synchronization criteria under SAMs and deception attacks are established by utilizing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and inequality techniques. Then, by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), we obtain the desired AETSD controller, which can satisfy the specified level of extended dissipativity behaviors. Lastly, one numerical example is given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Adversarial training; Adversarial attack; Trade-off; Decision boundary
ID ROBUSTNESS
AB The previous adversarial training methods tended to use a larger uniform perturbation budget to obtain an inclusive decision boundary, which improved robustness. However, this large uniform perturbation budget will bring an unnecessary increase in the margin along adversarial directions, causing heavy cross-over between natural and adversarial examples. It is not conducive to balancing the trade-off between robustness and natural accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training scheme, namely Moderate-Margin Adversarial Training (MMAT), to achieve a better trade-off. Specifically, we generate finer-grained adversarial examples to mitigate the cross-over between them and natural examples of neighboring classes. Meanwhile, we design a hybrid loss to learn adversarial examples and natural examples respectively to further obtain a moderate decision boundary. Extensive experiments show MMAT achieves high natural accuracy and robustness under both black-box and white-box attacks. Especially, state-of-the-art robustness and natural accuracy are achieved on SVHN.

AB Recent breakthroughs in wireless power transfer technology have been promising for empowering and enabling seamless operation of wireless sensors and developing sustainable systems such as wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Relying on this technology and focusing on WRSNs, this paper proposes an adaptive charging scheduling algorithm called the three-stage fuzzy metaheuristic algorithm (TSFM) by using the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and a multiobjective function designed to meet the application requirements of WRSNs in smart cities. The TSFM algorithm benefits from the WOA for the automated configuration and optimization of the fuzzy rule-base table in a three-stage fuzzy inference system for clustering, routing, and scheduling mobile charging simultaneously. Unlike the other methods, the TSFM algorithm determines the ratio of effect of fuzzy input parameters of every stage based on application and environment in addition to considering effective parameters for every stage, especially for charging scheduling (e.g., the energy of a charge-request node, the distance between a charge-request node and a mobile charging (MC), the density of a charge-request node, the average energy consumption rate of a charge-request node, and the time elapsed after a charge request). Furthermore, for the proper distribution of energy in a network, better responsiveness, and optimal use of a charging robot, two energy thresholds are defined in the TSFM algorithm, namely as the charging request issue threshold and the charging operation completion threshold. The TSFM algorithm is adaptable to applications, environments, and requirements of WRSNs not only by using the features of nodes (as the fuzzy input parameters) but also by considering the application-specific features, environments, and infrastructure (e.g., network size, number of nodes, base station (BS) positions, and designer's goals) within the process of optimizing tunable parameters. The TSFM algorithm was evaluated and compared with some common methods such as FCFS, NJNP, and ESS in terms of functional metrics such as energy utility, charging latency, survival rate, death rate of nodes, system stability, number of packets received by BS, number of request nodes, number of alive nodes, average residual energy, adaptability analysis, and statistical validation in two scenarios and six applications. According to the simulation results, the proposed TSFM algorithm improved the performance criteria and outperformed the other methods by far in terms of application. For instance, the TSFM algorithm improved the minimum system stability rate by 167%, 0.73%, and 123% compared with FCFS, NJNP, and ESS methods, respectively. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID INFORMATION
AB Recent studies on heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding-based recommendations have encountered challenges. These challenges are related to the data heterogeneity of the associated unstructured attribute or content (e.g., text-based summary/description) of users and items in the context of HIN. In order to address these challenges, in this article, we propose a novel approach of semantic-aware HIN embedding-based recommendation, called SemHE4Rec. In our proposed SemHE4Rec model, we define two embedding techniques for efficiently learning the representations of both users and items in the context of HIN. These rich-structural user and item representations are then used to facilitate the matrix factorization (MF) process. The first embedding technique is a traditional co-occurrence representation learning (CoRL) approach which aims to learn the co-occurrence of structural features of users and items. These structural features are represented for their interconnections in terms of meta-paths. In order to do that, we adopt the well-known meta-path-based random walk strategy and heterogeneous Skip-gram architecture. The second embedding approach is a semantic-aware representation learning (SRL) method. The SRL embedding technique is designed to focus on capturing the unstructured semantic relations between users and item content for the recommendation task. Finally, all the learned representations of users and items are then jointly combined and optimized while integrating with the extended MF for the recommendation task. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SemHE4Rec in comparison with the recent state-of-the-art HIN embedding-based recommendation techniques, and reveal that the joint text-based and co-occurrence-based representation learning can help to improve the recommendation performance.

AB Implicit functions are widely used in 3D human surface reconstruction due to their advantage to represent details. However, human reconstruction based on implicit functions struggles to maintain the integrity (unbroken body structure) and accuracy (no non-human parts) of human models. To address these issues, we propose a method, called TCR, for temporally consistent reconstruction of 3D clothed human surface with warp field. The fact that the general shape of a person does not change largely over time inspires us to exploit the temporally consistent shape information from previous frames to refine the human model of current frame. Therefore, we construct a canonical space and then store the shape information by updating the canonical model. To align the observed space with the canonical space, a warp field is firstly estimated for the forward and inverse warping of the human model. A probabilistic fusion strategy is then used to update the canonical model. In addition, the reconstructed result is further refined through the orthogonality constraints between the surface and its normal, which fully exploits the detailed information of estimated normal maps. Experiments on the Adobe and MonoPerfCap datasets show that TCR achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, TCR is more robust and can maintain the integrity and accuracy of the reconstructed human body even with extreme poses and partial occlusions.

AB Subspace clustering methods are now widely used for unsupervised high-dimensional data processing in computer vision and other domains. Deep subspace clustering methods based on auto-encoder networks have made a significant improvement in nonlinear subspace clustering problems in comparison to previous works. However, these methods ignore the valid information lost during feature extraction, resulting in incomplete information and imprecise feature representations for subspace clustering. In addition, the clustering performance of the existing clustering methods is excessively dependent on hyper-parameters, making training difficult and unstable. In this paper, we propose Deep Robust Multi-Channel Learning Subspace Clustering Networks (DRMCLSC), a novel deep subspace clustering network for learning more comprehensive feature representations with good robustness for subspace clustering. The multi-channel learning strategy allows the model to extract, retain and fuse features simultaneously, enabling all valid information from the sample data to be obtained. Moreover, the multi-channel learning structure of the proposed method produces a more stable integration network that is less dependent on hyper-parameters and more resistant to training errors than previous works. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the proposed method is superior and more effective than the state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods.

AB One option for teaching a robot new skills is to use learning from demonstration techniques. While traditional techniques often involve expensive sensors/equipment, advancements in computer vision have made it possible to achieve similar outcomes at a lower cost. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous research on a robot learning to produce 3D motions from 2D data and then using this knowledge to interact with people. To this end, we designed a study using a NAO robot to imitate human behavior by reproducing motions in 3D space after viewing a small number of 2D RGB videos for each motion. The goal is for the robot to learn certain social interactive skills by learning from video observation and then apply them during human-robot interaction. Five steps were taken to achieve this objective: 1) collecting a dataset, 2) human pose estimation, 3) transferring data from human space to the robot space, 4) robot control, and 5) human-robot interaction. These steps were separated into two phases, robot imitation learning and human-robot social interaction. The majority of the algorithms employed are deep learning-based, achieving similar to 96% accuracy in the action recognition on our dataset. The results were also promising when implemented on the robot. Overall, this preliminary exploratory study successfully showed the proof of concept for producing 3D motions from 2D data. This approach is noteworthy because of the amount of online training data, the robot can be trained quickly, and it does not require an expert.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In recent years, pulmonary vessel segmentation has aroused widespread interest in medical image analysis. However, the structure of pulmonary vessels is complex and CT images have a lot of noise. Therefore, it is a difficult task to extract pulmonary vessels accurately. In terms of pulmonary vessel segmentation, medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning only utilize single volume data in CT image, but cannot fully fuse multiple volume data, resulting in the accuracy of pulmonary vessel segmentation is low. In order to fully utilize the complementary advantages of multiple volume data, we propose a DS-ResUNet to segment pulmonary vessels in multi-view. The DS-ResUNet uses feature fusion module to fuse 2 mm and 5 mm volume data and makes full use of the detailed vessel textures in 2 mm volume data and coarse vessel structures in 5 mm volume data. By this multi-view fusion module, the accuracy of pulmonary vessel segmentation can be effectively improved. In addition, in order to strengthen the spatial weight of vessels and reduce the model parameters, we design a lightweight 3D axial attention module by separable convolution. To confirm the improved performance, we design some comparison experiments with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods. As a result, our DS-ResUNet has a better performance than other state-of-the-art methods on pulmonary vessel segmentation, but also has fewer parameters.

DE Anomaly detection; Generative adversarial network; Dynamic networks
AB Due to the wide application of dynamic graph anomaly detection in cybersecurity, social networks, e-commerce, etc., research in this area has received increasing attention. Graph generative adversarial networks can be used in dynamic graph anomaly detection due to their ability to model complex data, but the original graph generative adversarial networks do not have a method to learn reverse mapping and require an expensive process in recovering the potential representation of a given input. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel graph generative adversarial network by adding encoders to map real data to latent space to improve the training efficiency and stability of graph generative adversarial network models, which is named RegraphGAN in this paper. And this paper proposes a dynamic network anomaly edge detection method by combining RegraphGAN with spatiotemporal coding to solve the complex dynamic graph data and the problem of attribute-free node information coding challenges. Meanwhile, anomaly detection experiments are conducted on six real dynamic network datasets, and the results show that the dynamic network anomaly detection method proposed in this paper outperforms other existing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper proposes an unsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation model, called Perceptual Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network (PCGAN), which can mitigate the distortion problem to enhance performance of the traditional UI2I methods. The PCGAN is designed with a two-stage UI2I model. In the first stage of the PCGAN, it leverages a novel image warping to transform shapes of objects in input (source) images. In the second stage of the PCGAN, the residual prediction is devised in refinements of the outputs of the first stage of the PCGAN. To promote performance of the image warping, a loss function, called Perceptual Patch-Wise InfoNCE, is developed in the PCGAN to effectively memorize the visual correspondences between warped images and refined images. Experimental results on quantitative evaluation and visualization comparison for UI2I benchmarks show that the PCGAN is superior to other existing methods considered here.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper aims to study the fixed-time stabilization of a class of delayed discontinuous reaction- diffusion Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Firstly, by providing some relaxed conditions containing indefinite functions and based on inequality techniques, a new fixed-time stability lemma is given, which can improve the traditional ones. Secondly, based on state-dependent switching laws, the periodic wave solution of the formulated networks is transformed into the periodic solution of ordinary differential system. By utilizing differential inclusions theory and coincidence theorem, the existence of periodic solutions is obtained. Thirdly, based on the new fixed-time stability lemma, the periodic solutions are stabilized at zero in a fixed-time, which is a new topic on reaction-diffusion networks. Moreover, the established criteria are all delay-dependent, which are less conservative than the previous delay-independent ones for ensuring the stabilization of delayed reaction-diffusion networks. Finally, two examples give numerical explanations of the proposed results and highlight the influence of delays. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, although significant progress has been made by convolutional neural network, it is still difficult to realize accurate and robust stereo matching in real time. In this article, we study how to achieve more accurate and robust disparity estimation based on real-time requirement. For this reason, a Multi-scale Volume Fusion (MVF) module was proposed and embedded to improve the matching accuracy. To achieve real-time performance, an innovative way to use 3D convolution is proposed. The 3D convolution is used during training for guidance and supervision, making the inference lightweight. Based on these two structures, we designed an end-to-end stereo matching method called 3D Convolution Guided and Multi-scale Cost Volume Fusion Network (CGFNet). Experimental results showed that our CGFNet has better generalization performance on cross-domain datasets, which achieves more accurate disparity estimation without additional fine tuning process in challenging regions. On KITTI benchmark, CGFNet reached D1-all=1.98% with substantial improvement among the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) real-time models and runs a pair of images within 38 ms (26 fps). The results are notable when considering both matching accuracy and real-time performance.

AB Clinical event sequences consist of hundreds of clinical events that represent records of patient care in time. Developing accurate predictive models of such sequences is of a great importance for supporting a variety of models for interpreting/classifying the current patient condition, or predicting adverse clinical events , outcomes, all aimed to improve patient care. One important challenge of learning predictive models of clinical sequences is their patient-specific variability. Based on underlying clinical conditions, each patient's sequence may consist of different sets of clinical events (observations, lab results, medications, procedures). Hence, simple population-wide models learned from event sequences for many different patients may not accurately predict patient-specific dynamics of event sequences and their differences. To address the problem, we propose and investigate multiple new event sequence prediction models and methods that let us better adjust the prediction for individual patients and their specific conditions. The methods developed in this work pursue refinement of population-wide models to subpopulations, self-adaptation , a meta-level model switching that is able to adaptively select the model with the best chance to support the immediate prediction. We analyze and test the performance of these models on clinical event sequences of patients in MIMIC-III database.

AB Predicting defect-prone software components can play a significant role in allocating relevant testing resources to fault-prone modules and hence increasing the business value of software projects. Most of the current software defect prediction studies utilize traditional supervised machine learning algorithms to predict defects in software applications. The software datasets utilized in such studies are imbalanced and therefore the reported results cannot be reliably used to judge their performance. Moreover, it is important to explain the output of machine learning models employed in fault-predication techniques to determine the contribution of each utilized feature to the model output. In this paper, we propose a new framework for predicting software defects utilizing eleven machine learning classifiers over twelve different datasets. For feature selection, we employ four different nature-inspired search algorithms, namely, particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, harmony algorithm, and ant colony optimization. Moreover, we make use of the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to address the problem of data imbalance. Furthermore, we utilize the Shapley additive explanation model for highlighting the highest determinative features. The obtained results demonstrate that gradient boosting, stochastic gradient boosting, decision trees, and categorical boosting outperform others tested model with over 90% accuracy and ROC-AUC.

AB The remarkable advancement of image and video generation models has led to the creation of exceptionally realistic content, posing challenges in differentiating between genuine and fabricated instances in numerous scenarios. However, despite this progress, a gap remains between the quality of generated images and those found in the real world. To address this, we have reviewed a vast body of literature from both academic publications and social media to identify qualitative shortcomings in image generation models, which we have classified into five categories. By understanding these failures, we can identify areas where these models need improvement, as well as develop strategies for detecting generated images and deepfakes. The prevalence of deepfakes in today's society is a serious concern, and our findings can help mitigate their negative impact. In order to support research in this field, a collection of instances where models have failed is made available at here.

   learning; Spatial-temporal self-attention
AB Most existing self-supervised works learn video representation by using a single pretext task. A single pretext task, providing single supervision from unlabeled data, may neglect to describe the difference between spatial features and temporal features. The similar spatial features and temporal features may hinder distinguishing between two similar videos with different class labels. In this paper, we propose an attentive spatial-temporal contrastive learning network (ASTCNet), which learns self-attention spatial-temporal features by contrastive learning between multiple spatial and temporal pretext tasks. The spatial features are learned by multiple spatial pretext tasks, including spatial rotation, and spatial jigsaw. Each spatial feature is enhanced with spatial selfattention by learning the relation between patches. The temporal features are learned by multiple temporal pretext tasks, including temporal order, and temporal pace. Each temporal feature is enhanced with temporal self-attention by learning the relation between frames, and is enhanced by feeding the optical flow features into a motion module. To separate the spatial feature and the temporal feature learned in one video, we represent the video as different features for each pretext task, and design pretext task-based contrastive loss. The pretext taskbased contrastive loss encourages the different pretext tasks to learn dissimilar features, and encourages the same pretext task to learn similar features. The pretext task-based contrastive loss can learn the discriminative features for each pretext task in one video. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for self-supervised action recognition on the UCF101 dataset and the HMDB51 dataset.

AB Unsupervised person re-identification (re-ID) aims at cross-camera pedestrian retrieval without manual annotation. Recently, the contrastive learning has been introduced into the field of unsupervised person re-ID. However, existing methods usually focus only on mining the intra-category similarity and neglect the negative effects of clustering noise, which limits the performance in unsupervised person re-ID. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Hybrid Contrastive Learning (DHCL) method for unsupervised person re-ID. Specifically, we perform the clustering algorithm and the dynamic refinement policy to divide the unlabeled training dataset into two subsets, i.e., clustered samples with pseudo labels and un-clustered independent instances, at each training epoch. Then, the proposed DHCL guides the feature extraction network to mine the intra-category similarity from the clustered samples by applying attraction within samples of the same cluster. Meanwhile, the inter-instance discrimination is also mined by pushing away different instances. Besides, we integrate the two levels of contrastive learning into an end-to-end framework and exploit the complementarity between them to improve the separability of the feature space. To reduce the negative effect of over-focusing on positive samples, a penalty item is added to the hybrid contrastive loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in unsupervised person re-ID.

DE Granular neighborhood rough set; Incremental algorithm; Attribute

ID ALGORITHM
AB In the framework of rough sets, incremental algorithms can effectively reduce repetitive computations for dynamic datasets by discovering the update principles of relevant knowledge. Considering the variations in attribute sets, incremental methods based on neighborhood granulation provide fast updates to attribute reduction in continuousvalued information systems. However, most of these methods assume that the sample distribution and neighborhood radius remain fixed with changes in the attribute set, which may mislead the granulation process and affect the model's classification ability. In this paper, a new incremental reduction method based on granular balls and attribute grouping is proposed for dynamic information systems with multiple attribute additions. Different neighborhood radii are adaptively determined when the attribute set changes, and the number of neighborhood granules can also be effectively reduced. Furthermore, the attributes are grouped based on the k-means algorithm, and only attributes from different groups or with small relevance to those in the current reduction set are considered to be incorporated as a reduction attribute, thus reducing the computation time and simultaneously preserving informative attributes. Linear and nonlinear correlation coefficients are used to measure attribute relevance based on which three corresponding incremental reduction algorithms are developed. Finally, extensive experimental results on 12 benchmark datasets are shown to compare the proposed method with non-incremental and typical incremental methods in terms of time cost, classification accuracy, the size of attribute reduction, and coverage of the reduction.

AB We propose a cut-free cyclic system for transitive closure logic (TCL) based on a form of hypersequents, suitable for automated reasoning via proof search. We show that previously proposed sequent systems are cut-free incomplete for basic validities from Kleene Algebra (KA) and propositional dynamic logic (PDL), over standard translations. On the other hand, our system faithfully simulates known cyclic systems for KA and PDL, thereby inheriting their completeness results. A peculiarity of our system is its richer correctness criterion, exhibiting 'alternating traces' and necessitating a more intricate soundness argument than for traditional cyclic proofs.

AB There is a growing recognition that electronic band structure is a local property of materials and devices, and there is steep growth in capabilities to collect the relevant data. New photon sources, from small-laboratory-based lasers to free electron lasers, together with focusing beam optics and advanced electron spectrometers, are beginning to enable angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) in scanning mode with a spatial resolution of near to and below microns, two- to three orders of magnitude smaller than what has been typical for ARPES hitherto. The results are vast data sets inhabiting a five-dimensional subspace of the ten-dimensional space spanned by two scanning dimensions of real space, three of reciprocal space, three of spin-space, time, and energy. In this work, we demonstrate that recent developments in representational learning (self-supervised learning) combined with k-means clustering can help automate the labeling and spatial mapping of dispersion cuts, thus saving precious time relative to manual analysis, albeit with low performance. Finally, we introduce a few-shot learning (k-nearest neighbor) in representational space where we selectively choose one (k = 1) image reference for each known label and subsequently label the rest of the data with respect to the nearest reference image. This last approach demonstrates the strength of self-supervised learning to automate image analysis in ARPES in particular and can be generalized to any scientific image analysis.

AB Random noise arising from physical processes is an inherent characteristic of measurements and a limiting factor for most signal processing and data analysis tasks. Given the recent interest in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for data-driven modeling, it is important to determine to what extent GANs can faithfully reproduce noise in target data sets. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation that aims to shed light on this issue for time series. Namely, we assess two general-purpose GANs for time series that are based on the popular deep convolutional GAN architecture, a direct time-series model and an image-based model that uses a short-time Fourier transform data representation. The GAN models are trained and quantitatively evaluated using distributions of simulated noise time series with known ground-truth parameters. Target time series distributions include a broad range of noise types commonly encountered in physical measurements, electronics, and communication systems: band-limited thermal noise, power law noise, shot noise, and impulsive noise. We find that GANs are capable of learning many noise types, although they predictably struggle when the GAN architecture is not well suited to some aspects of the noise, e.g. impulsive time-series with extreme outliers. Our findings provide insights into the capabilities and potential limitations of current approaches to time-series GANs and highlight areas for further research. In addition, our battery of tests provides a useful benchmark to aid the development of deep generative models for time series.

AB The construction of a better exchange-correlation potential in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) can improve the accuracy of TDDFT calculations and provide more accurate predictions of the properties of many-electron systems. Here, we propose a machine learning method to develop the energy functional and the Kohn-Sham potential of a time-dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) system is proposed. The method is based on the dynamics of the Kohn-Sham system and does not require any data on the exact Kohn-Sham potential for training the model. We demonstrate the results of our method with a 1D harmonic oscillator example and a 1D two-electron example. We show that the machine-learned Kohn-Sham potential matches the exact Kohn-Sham potential in the absence of memory effect. Our method can still capture the dynamics of the Kohn-Sham system in the presence of memory effects. The machine learning method developed in this article provides insight into making better approximations of the energy functional and the Kohn-Sham potential in the TDKS system.

DE Video frame interpolation; Deep learning; Space-time convolutions
AB Many modern frame interpolation approaches rely on explicit bidirectional optical flows between adjacent frames, thus are sensitive to the accuracy of underlying flow estimation in handling occlusions while additionally introducing computational bottlenecks unsuitable for efficient deployment. In this paper, we propose a flow-free approach that is completely end-to-end trainable for multi-frame video interpolation. Our method, FLAVR, leverages 3D spatio-temporal kernels to directly learn motion properties from unlabeled videos and greatly simplifies the process of training, testing and deploying frame interpolation models. As a result, FLAVR delivers up to 6x speed up compared to the current state-of-the-art methods for multi-frame interpolation while consistently demonstrating superior qualitative and quantitative results compared with prior methods on popular benchmarks includingVimeo-90K, SNU-Film, and GoPro. Additionally, we showthat frame interpolation is a competitive self-supervised pre-training task for videos by demonstrating various novel applications of FLAVR including action recognition, optical flow estimation, and video object tracking. Code and trained models are available in the project page: https://tarun005.github.io/ FLAVR/. We have provided additional qualitative results for frame interpolation as well as downstream applications in our video available using this web link https://paperid1300.s3.us- west- 2.amazonaws.com/ FLAVRVideo.mp4 (link).

DE Fine-Grained anomaly recognition; Process-Oriented associativity;
   Heterogeneous graph learning; Industrial control systems
AB Over the past few years, massive penetrations targeting an Industrial Control System (ICS) network intend to compromise its core industrial processes. So far, numerous advanced methods have been proposed to detect anomalous patterns in the numeric data streams with respect to the heterogeneous field devices involved in the industrial processes. These methods, despite reporting decent results, usually conduct system-wise detection instead of fine-grained anomalous pattern recognition at the device level. Further-more, lacking explicit consideration of the exclusive process-related features with respect to each differ-entiated device, the fitness of their application in specified industrial processes is undermined. To tackle these issues, a GNN-based Attributed Heterogeneous Graph Analyzer (the AHGA) is designed to perform device-wise anomalous pattern detection via in-depth process-oriented associativity learning. The AHGA's framework is constructed with four building blocks: a graph processor, a feature analyzer, a link inference decoder, and an anomaly detector. Its performance is assessed and compared against multiple link infer-ence and anomaly detection baselines over 2 popular ICS datasets (SWaT and WADI). Comparative results demonstrate the AHGA's reliability in capturing sophisticated process-oriented relations among heteroge-neous devices as well as its effectiveness in boosting the performance of anomalous pattern recognition at device-level granularity.

AB Consider a stream of d-dimensional rows (points in R-d) arriving sequentially. An epsilon-coreset is a positively weighted subset that approximates their sum of squared distances to any linear subspace of R-d, up to a 1 +/- epsilon factor. Unlike other data summarizations, such a coreset: (1) can be used to minimize faster any optimization function that uses this sum, such as regularized or constrained regression, (2) preserves input sparsity; (3) easily interpretable; (4) avoids numerical errors; (5) applies to problems with constraints on the input, such as subspaces that are spanned by few input points. Our main result is the first algorithm that returns such an epsilon-coreset using finite and constant memory during the streaming, i.e., independent of n, the number of rows seen so far. The coreset consists of O(d log(2) d/epsilon(2)) weighted rows, which is nearly optimal according to existing lower bounds of Omega(d/epsilon(2)). We support our findings with experiments on theWikipedia dataset benchmarked against state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI HmcNet: A General Approach for Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification

DT Article
DE Hierarchical multi-label classification; attention mechanism; path

ID ENSEMBLES
AB Hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) deals with the problem of assigning each entity to multiple classes with a taxonomic structure (e.g., tree). Within this structure, classes at different levels tend to have dependencies under the hierarchy constraints. However, most prior studies for HMC tasks tend to ignore the class dependencies within the hierarchy. Moreover, most existing methods generate incoherent predictions and do not satisfy the hierarchy constraint. To this end, based on previously developed HARNN, we propose a general framework, HmcNet, for introducing explicit and implicit class hierarchy constraints to generate coherent predictions. We develop an efficient Prune-based Coherent Prediction (PCP) strategy for the optimal paths selection, which produces coherent predictions in a principled way. HmcNet can be well explained from two perspectives. First, it develops the Hierarchical Attention-based Memory (HAM) unit with implicit class hierarchy constraints to capture class dependencies more intuitively; Second, it subsumes explicit class hierarchy constraints during training and inference phases and generates coherent predictions in a consistent manner. Finally, extensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the HmcNet frameworks. To facilitate future research, our code has been made publicly available.

TI Model Inversion Attacks Against Graph Neural Networks

DT Article
DE Data privacy; graphs and networks; graph neural networks; privacy
   attacks; model inversion attacks
ID PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK
AB Many data mining tasks rely on graphs to model relational structures among individuals (nodes). Since relational data are often sensitive, there is an urgent need to evaluate the privacy risks in graph data. One famous privacy attack against data analysis models is the model inversion attack, which aims to infer sensitive data in the training dataset and leads to great privacy concerns. Despite its success in grid-like domains, directly applying model inversion attacks on non-grid domains such as graph leads to poor attack performance. This is mainly due to the failure to consider the unique properties of graphs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study on model inversion attacks against Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools in this paper. First, in the white-box setting where the attacker has full access to the target GNN model, we present GraphMI to infer the private training graph data. Specifically in GraphMI, a projected gradient module is proposed to tackle the discreteness of graph edges and preserve the sparsity and smoothness of graph features; a graph auto-encoder module is used to efficiently exploit graph topology, node attributes, and target model parameters for edge inference; a random sampling module can finally sample discrete edges. Furthermore, in the hard-label black-box setting where the attacker can only query the GNN API and receive the classification results, we propose two methods based on gradient estimation and reinforcement learning (RL-GraphMI). With the proposed methods, we study the connection between model inversion risk and edge influence and show that edges with greater influence are more likely to be recovered. Extensive experiments over several public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also evaluate our attacks under two defenses: one is the well-designed differential private training, and the other is graph preprocessing. Our experimental results show that such defenses are not sufficiently effective and call for more advanced defenses against privacy attacks.

DT Article
DE Disentangling; structural semantics; structure-level; hypergraph
AB Graph disentangling is a new promising direction that can help us to discover the latent patterns in the data and understand the behaviors of a graph learning model. Despite the many efforts in disentangling representation learning, few works focus on disentangling the latent factors behind a graph. Most current foci are mainly on studying node-level semantics in the graphs. Compared with node-level, the structure-level view can provide a new interpretable and in-depth insight into graph data. The study of structure-level relations enables us to reveal the high-order structural semantics in the data. To explore the complex high-order structural semantics in the data, we propose the High-order Structural Semantic Disentangled Neural Network (HSDN) to model the graph structure units and disentangle structural semantics. It's the first attempt to hypergraph disentangled networks. Unlike prior methods that disentangle factor graphs based on pair-wise relations only, we introduce hyperedges on pair-wise graphs to model structure units and disentangle the complex high-order structural semantics between different structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSDN achieves state-of-the-art performances in terms of both disentangling and downstream tasks.

TI Noun Compound Interpretation With Relation Classification and

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Noun compound interpretation; relation classification; paraphrasing
AB Noun compounds are abundant in various languages and their interpretations have been applied in a wide range of NLP tasks. However, most existing work only uses relation classification- or paraphrasing-based methods to model this problem, failing in coverage or accuracy. We argue that the above two approaches are complementary to each other for the noun compound interpretation. In this paper, we propose a two-phase strategy to solve this task. The first phase is to perform the relation classification sub-task with a novel multi-view representation learning model. When noun compounds are predicted as the non-semantic relation, i.e., NA, or the confidence scores are below the threshold, the second phase, namely paraphrasing, will be triggered to interpret noun compounds with a contrastive slot filling method. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we construct the largest Chinese dataset for noun compound interpretation in the life service domain. The experimental results on our constructed and public datasets prove the effectiveness of our solution. Furthermore, the online A/B testing on Meituan APP suggests that the Query View Click-Through Rate increases by 0.91% when noun compounds are used to enrich semantic information of items with the help of their interpretations on the platform.

TI Statistically Significant Pattern Mining With Ordinal Utility

DT Article
DE High-utility pattern; multiple testing; significant pattern mining
ID FALSE DISCOVERY RATE
AB Statistically significant pattern mining (SSPM), which evaluates each pattern via a hypothesis test, is an essential and challenging data mining task for knowledge discovery. We introduce a preference relation between patterns and aim to discover the most preferred patterns under the constraint of statistical significance, which has never been considered in existing SSPM problems. We propose an iterative multiple testing procedure that can alternately reject a hypothesis and safely ignore the less useful hypotheses than the rejected one. By filtering out patterns with low utility, we can avoid the significance budget consumption of rejecting useless (uninteresting) patterns and focus the significance budget on more useful patterns, leading to more useful discoveries. We show that the proposed method can control the familywise error rate (FWER) under certain assumptions, which can be satisfied by a realistic problem class in SSPM. We also show that the proposed method always discovers equally or more useful patterns than Tarone-Bonferroni and Subfamily-wise Multiple Testing (SMT). Finally, we conducted several experiments with both synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the performance of our method. The proposed method discovered many more useful patterns in the experiments with real-world datasets than the existing method for all five conducted tasks.

AB With the proliferation of online social networks, a great deal of online user action data has been generated. Such data has enabled the study of information diffusion prediction, which is a fundamental problem for understanding the propagation of information on social media platforms. In diffusion prediction models, there are two standard components, i.e., a social graph and information diffusion cascades. We observe that both components exhibit latent hierarchical structures. However, most existing models are designed based on euclidean spaces, and hence cannot effectively capture complex patterns, especially hierarchical structures. Therefore, we investigate a novel research problem to learn hyperbolic representations for information diffusion prediction. To reflect the different characteristics of social graphs and diffusion cascades, we encode them into two latent hyperbolic spaces with different trainable curvatures. In addition, to model influence dependencies, we propose a co-attention mechanism to capture the processes of diffusion cascades using positional embeddings. Given a set of activated seed users, we jointly exploit diffusion cascades and social links to predict which users will be influenced. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed H-Diffu model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion prediction frameworks.

TI Concept-Level Model Interpretation From the Causal Aspect
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Model interpretation; causal discovery
AB With the increasing growth of data and the ability of learning with them, machine learning models are adopted in various domains. However, few of machine learning models are able to reason their prediction, which limits their further applications in real-world tasks. With the potential to address this dilemma, model interpretation has become an important research topic because of the ability to provide the underlying reasons for model predictions at the feature level or concept level. Model interpretation at the concept level focuses on exploring the roles of concepts in model prediction, which enables more compact and understandable interpretations. Concept-level model interpretation requires the identification of the concepts that contribute to model prediction and the exploration of the rules underneath these concepts. To achieve the two objectives, we propose a Concept-level Model Interpretation framework (CMIC) from the perspective of causality. CMIC can automatically detect concepts in data and discover the causal relation between the detected concepts and the model's predicted labels. Furthermore, CMIC ranks the contributions of concepts by their causal effect on the model prediction, reflecting the detected concepts' importance. We evaluate the proposed CMIC framework on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the quality of the provided interpretation.

TI Sylvester Equation Induced Collaborative Representation Learning for
   Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

   representation learning; sylvester equation
AB For an actual recommendation system, it generally involves a variety of heterogeneous interactive relationships, such as the typical user-user (U2U), item-item (I2I), and user-item (U2I) interaction relationships. With the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in embedding various interactive relations, recommendation technology has made gratifying progress in recent years, which benefits lot from its powerful ability in relation modeling. However, most of the existing GNN-based methods fail to collaboratively explore the above heterogeneous multiple interactive relationships, including the internal correlations among multiple relationships and the intrinsic association behind different relationships. As a consequence, the user's personalized preference for the items to be recommended will not be well captured. In this paper, we propose a Sylvester equation induced Collaborative Representation Learning framework (S-CRL) for recommendation system by utilizing the heterogeneous multiple interactive relationships. In particular, we ingeniously define a novel Sylvester equation to associate tactfully the multiple heterogeneous relations together. From the perspective of rating propagation, such Sylvester equation is shown theoretically to be the optimal solution of a local structure sensitive rating propagation function. Additionally, to seek more expressive embeddings about user and item, a layer-wise attention is introduced to aggregate the multi-hop information from U2U and I2I graphs, respectively, so as to promote the aggregation with the corresponding embeddings from the U2I interaction graph. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets verify that our model achieves more favorable performance over currently representative methods.

AB Causal effect estimation from observational data is a challenging problem, especially with high dimensional data and in the presence of unobserved variables. The available data-driven methods for tackling the problem either provide an estimation of the bounds of a causal effect (i.e., nonunique estimation) or have low efficiency. The major hurdle for achieving high efficiency while trying to obtain unique and unbiased causal effect estimation is how to find a proper adjustment set for confounding control in a fast way, given the huge covariate space and considering unobserved variables. In this paper, we approach the problem as a local search task for finding valid adjustment sets in data. We establish the theorems to support the local search for adjustment sets, and we show that unique and unbiased estimation can be achieved from observational data even when there exist unobserved variables. We then propose a data-driven algorithm that is fast and consistent under mild assumptions. We also make use of a frequent pattern mining method to further speed up the search of minimal adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Experiments conducted on extensive synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art criteria/estimators in both accuracy and time-efficiency.

AB Multiple clusterings can explore the same set of data from different perspectives by discovering different and meaningful clusterings. However, most, if not all, of the existing approaches overwhelmingly focus on the diversity between clustering subspaces, and pay much less attention on the salience of the subspaces. As a consequence, the quality of the produced clusterings is an understudied aspect of the problem. Furthermore, existing methods cannot explain the unique internal subspace structure of each clustering, and cannot incorporate multi-facet knowledge to generate different clusterings. In this paper, we propose a solution named iMClusts (interpretable Multiple Clusterings by diversified attention). iMClusts makes use of the expressive representational power of deep autoencoders and multi-head attention to generate multiple salient embedding matrices, and multiple clusterings therein. In addition, it leverages multi-facet knowledge and enhances the diversity between heads to boost the quality and diversity of multiple clusterings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that iMClusts can generate multiple clusterings with quality, interpretability, and diversity.

TI Implicit Event Argument Extraction With Argument-Argument Relational

LA English
DT Article
DE Implicit event argument extraction; argument-argument relation;
   knowledge distillation; curriculum learning
AB As a challenging sub-task of event argument extraction, implicit event argument extraction seeks to identify document-level arguments that play direct or implicit roles in a given event. Prior work mainly focuses on capturing direct relations between arguments and the event trigger; however, the lack of reasoning ability imposes limitations to the extraction of implicit arguments. In this work, we propose an Argument-argument Relation-enhanced Event Argument extraction (AREA) learning framework to tackle this issue through reasoning in event frame-level scope. The proposed method leverages related arguments of the expected one as clues, and utilizes such argument-argument dependencies to guide the reasoning process. To bridge the distribution gap between oracle knowledge used in the training phase and the imperfect related arguments in the test stage, we introduce a conventional knowledge distillation strategy to drive a final model that can work without extra inputs by mimicking the behaviour of a well-informed teacher model. In addition, considering that conventional knowledge distillation methods transfer knowledge individually, we integrate it with a novel relational knowledge distillation mechanism to explicitly capture the structural mutual argument-argument relation. Moreover, since the training process is not compatible with the real situation, a curriculum learning method is further introduced to make the training process smoother. Experimental results demonstrate that the learning framework obtains state-of-the-art performance on the RAMS and Wikievents datasets. Ablation study and further discussion also show it could handle long-range dependency and implicit argument problems effectively.

TI Pre-Trained Semantic Embeddings for POI Categories Based on Multiple

ID REPRESENTATION
AB The past decade has witnessed the increasingly created point-of-interest (POI) data, which are utilized to express the semantics of places. To understand the POI semantics, current methods usually embed POI categories into a latent space via certain trajectory sequential models, while neglecting the underlining spatial information. It is noteworthy that the complex spatial relationships among POI categories contain substantial information that benefits meaningful semantic embeddings for various POI categories. Inspired by this, we present a unified POI Category Embedding Method (CatEM for short), which jointly encodes the sequential transitions and spatial relations of POI categories as well as the adaptive semantic neighbors of each POI category. The merits of CatEM lie in that: (1) it considers the pairwise spatial similarities between categories and represents categories with larger similarity values with adjacent embeddings in the latent space, and (2) it adaptively locates neighbor categories with similar semantics in the embedding space to improve the adaptivity of POI category embedding. The proposed pre-trained POI category embeddings are justified by three downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model, as compared to several cutting-edge baselines.

AB In today's society, location-based services are widely used which collect a huge amount of human trajectories. Analyzing semantic meanings of these trajectories can benefit numerous real-world applications, such as product advertisement, friend recommendation, and social behavior analysis. However, existing works on semantic trajectories are mostly centralized approaches that are not able to keep up with the rapidly growing trajectory collections. In this paper, we propose a novel large-scale semantic trajectory analysis algorithm in Apache Spark. We design a new hash function along with efficient distributed algorithms that can quickly compute semantic trajectory similarities and identify communities of people with similar behavior across the world. The experimental results show that our approach is more than 30 times faster than centralized approaches without sacrificing any accuracy like other parallel approaches.

AB A k-core is the special cohesive subgraph where each vertex has at least k degree. It is widely used in graph mining applications such as community detection, visualization, and clique discovery. Because dynamic graphs frequently evolve, obtaining their k-cores via decomposition is inefficient. Instead, previous studies proposed various methods for updating k-cores based on inserted (removed) edges. Unfortunately, the parallelism of existing approaches is limited due to their theoretical constraints. To further improve the parallelism of maintenance algorithms, we refine the k-core maintenance theorem and propose two effective parallel methods to update k-cores for insertion and removal cases. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms on real-world graphs by one order of magnitude.

AB Deep semi-supervised learning is a fast-growing field with a range of practical applications. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on both fundamentals and recent advances in deep semi-supervised learning methods from perspectives of model design and unsupervised loss functions. We first present a taxonomy for deep semi-supervised learning that categorizes existing methods, including deep generative methods, consistency regularization methods, graph-based methods, pseudo-labeling methods, and hybrid methods. Then we provide a comprehensive review of 60 representative methods and offer a detailed comparison of these methods in terms of the type of losses, architecture differences, and test performance results. In addition to the progress in the past few years, we further discuss some shortcomings of existing methods and provide some tentative heuristic solutions for solving these open problems.

AB The well-known benefits of cloud computing have spurred the popularity of database service outsourcing, where one can resort to the cloud to conveniently store and query databases. Coming with such popular trend is the threat to data privacy, as the cloud gains access to the databases and queries which may contain sensitive information, like medical or financial data. A large body of work has been presented for querying encrypted databases, which has been mostly focused on secure keyword search. In this paper, we instead focus on the support for secure skyline query processing over encrypted outsourced databases, where little work has been done. Skyline query is an advanced kind of database query which is important for multi-criteria decision-making systems and applications. We propose SecSkyline, a new system framework building on lightweight cryptography for fast privacy-preserving skyline queries. SecSkyline ambitiously provides strong protection for not only the content confidentiality of the outsourced database, the query, and the result, but also for data patterns that may incur indirect data leakages, such as dominance relationships among data points and search access patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecSkyline is substantially superior to the state-of-the-art in query latency, with up to $813\times$813x improvement.

   uncertainty; user behavior prediction
AB With the rapid growth of the number of private vehicles, searching for accessible parking spaces becomes intractable for drivers, especially during high-demand hours. In recent years, we are witnessing a number of sharing economy services. Contract parking sharing, as an innovative sharing economy mode, has the potential to alleviate the difficult parking issue and make full use of the urban parking resources. However, the uncertainties of both drivers' parking demand and owners' sharing supply make it challenging to achieve efficient sharing. Thanks to IoT technology, many current parking lots now record vehicles' fine-grained parking data for billing purposes. Leveraging these fine-grained parking data, we exploit available contract parking spaces to share them with drivers that have temporary parking demand. Specifically, we propose W(2)Parking, a win-win contract parking sharing system, which includes two key components: (i) an idle time prediction model to estimate available periods of parking spaces and (ii) a parking sharing model to schedule temporary users to have access to these available parking spaces under both demand and supply uncertainties using dynamic programming combined with a 2-approximation algorithm with performance-bound guarantees. we evaluate our system on seven-month real-world parking data from 368 parking lots with 14,704 parking spaces. Extensive experimental results show that our W(2)Parking achieves more than 90% of accuracy in parking time prediction, and the utilization rate of contract parking spaces is improved by 35%.

AB Representation learning of knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to embed both entities and relations as vectors in a continuous low-dimensional space, which has facilitated various applications such as link prediction and entity retrieval. Most existing KG embedding methods focus on modeling the structured fact triples independently and ignore the multi-type relations among triples as well as the variety of data types (e.g., texts and images) associated with entities in KGs, and thus fail to capture the complex and multi-modal information that is inherently inside the entity-relation triples. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for knowledge graph embedding named Contrastive Multi-modal Graph Neural Network (CMGNN), which can encapsulate comprehensive features from multi-modal content descriptions of entities and high-order connectivity structures. Specifically, CMGNN first learns entity embeddings from multi-modal content and then contrasts encodings from multi-relational local neighbors and high-order connectivities to obtain latent representations of entities and relations simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that CMGNN can effectively model the multi-modalities and multi-type structures in KGs, and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for the tasks of link prediction and entity classification.

AB Approximate nearest neighbour search (ANNS) in high-dimensional space is an essential and fundamental operation in many applications from many domains such as multimedia database, information retrieval and computer vision. With the rapidly growing volume of data and the dramatically increasing demands of users, traditional heuristic-based ANNS solutions have been facing great challenges in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Inspired by the recent successes of deep learning in many fields, substantial efforts have been devoted to applying deep learning techniques to ANNS for learning to index and learning to search, resulting in numerous algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art performance compared with conventional methods. In this survey paper, we comprehensively review the different types of deep learning-based ANNS methods according to two learning paradigms: learning to index and learning to search. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of these methods in a systematic manner. Based on the overview, we point out that end-to-end learning will be a new and promising research direction for deep learning-based ANNS, i.e., applying deep learning techniques to jointly learn the indexing and searching together, such that the underlying knowledge learned from data can directly contribute to the final searching performance. Finally, we conduct experiments and provide general performance analyses for the representative deep learning-based ANNS algorithms.

TI Dual Feature Interaction-Based Graph Convolutional Network

DT Article
DE Feature interaction; graph convolutional network; graph neural network;
   network embedding
AB Graphs are widely used to model various practical applications. In recent years, graph convolution networks (GCNs) have attracted increasing attention due to the extension of convolution operation from traditional grid data to graph one. However, the representation ability of current GCNs is undoubtedly limited because existing work fails to consider feature interactions. Toward this end, we propose a Dual Feature Interaction-based GCN. Specifically, it models feature interaction in the aspects of 1) node features where we use Newton's identity to extract different-order cross features implicit in the original features and design an attention mechanism to fuse them; and 2) graph convolution where we capture the pairwise interactions among nodes in the neighborhood to expand a weighted sum operation. We evaluate the proposed model with graph data from different fields, and the experimental results on semi-supervised node classification and link prediction demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GCN. The data and source codes of this work are available at https://github.com/ZZY-GraphMiningLab/DFI-GCN.

DE Index Terms-Contrastive learning; region representation; multi-view

AB Unsupervised region representation learning aims to extract dense and effective features from unlabeled urban data. While some efforts have been made for solving this problem based on multiple views, existing methods are still insufficient in extracting representations in a view and/or incorporating representations from different views. Motivated by the success of contrastive learning for representation learning, we propose to leverage it for multi-view region representation learning and design a model called ReMVC (Region Embedding with Multi-View Contrastive Learning) by following two guidelines: $i$i) comparing a region with others within each view for effective representation extraction and $ii$ii) comparing a region with itself across different views for cross-view information sharing. We design the intra-view contrastive learning module which helps to learn distinguished region embeddings and the inter-view contrastive learning module which serves as a soft co-regularizer to constrain the embedding parameters and transfer knowledge across multi-views. We exploit the learned region embeddings in two downstream tasks named land usage clustering and region popularity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves impressive improvements compared with seven state-of-the-art baseline methods, and the margins are over 30% in the land usage clustering task.

TI Rethinking Graph Auto-Encoder Models for Attributed Graph Clustering
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Unsupervised learning; graph clustering; graph auto-encoders
AB Most recent graph clustering methods have resorted to Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) to perform joint clustering and embedding learning. However, two critical issues have been overlooked. First, the accumulative error, inflicted by learning from noisy clustering assignments, degrades the effectiveness of the clustering model. This problem is called Feature Randomness. Second, reconstructing the adjacency matrix sets the model to learn irrelevant similarities for the clustering task. This problem is called Feature Drift. Furthermore, the theoretical relation between the aforementioned problems has not yet been investigated. We study these issues from two aspects: (1) there is a trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift when clustering and reconstruction are performed at the same level, and (2) the problem of Feature Drift is more pronounced for GAE models, compared with vanilla auto-encoder models. Thus, we reformulate the GAE-based clustering methodology. Our solution is two-fold. First, we propose a sampling operator E that triggers a protection mechanism against Feature Randomness. Second, we propose an operator T that triggers a correction mechanism against Feature Drift by gradually transforming the reconstructed graph into a clustering oriented one. As principal advantages, our solution grants a considerable improvement in clustering effectiveness and can be easily tailored to GAE models.

TI Learning Bi-Typed Multi-Relational Heterogeneous Graph Via Dual

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

   hierarchical attention networks; GNNs
AB Bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graph (BMHG) is one of the most common graphs in practice, for example, academic networks, e-commerce user behavior graph and enterprise knowledge graph. It is a critical and challenge problem on how to learn the numerical representation for each node to characterize subtle structures. However, most previous studies treat all node relations in BMHG as the same class of relation without distinguishing the different characteristics between the intra-type relations and inter-type relations of the bi-typed nodes, causing the loss of significant structure information. To address this issue, we propose a novel Dual Hierarchical Attention Networks (DHAN) based on the bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graphs to learn comprehensive node representations with the intra-type and inter-type attention-based encoder under a hierarchical mechanism. Specifically, the former encoder aggregates information from the same type of nodes, while the latter aggregates node representations from its different types of neighbors. Moreover, to sufficiently model node multi-relational information in BMHG, we adopt a newly proposed hierarchical mechanism. By doing so, the proposed dual hierarchical attention operations enable our model to fully capture the complex structures of the bi-typed multi-relational heterogeneous graphs. Experimental results on various tasks against the state-of-the-arts sufficiently confirm the capability of DHAN in learning node representations on the BMHGs.

DE Data streams; frequency query; sketch; sliding windows; temporal
   membership query
AB Nowadays, research on temporal membership queries is indispensable. Generally, temporal membership queries exist in two modalities: fixed windows and sliding windows, the latter having obvious advantages. The first sketch that implements temporal membership queries is the persistent Bloom filter (PBF). PBF has two shortcomings: it does not support sliding windows nor frequency queries. Here, we propose HoppingSketch to promote the original PBF. It is the first sketch that implements temporal membership queries for sliding windows. HoppingSketch is a general and efficient data stream processing framework, able to implement different tasks thanks to different atomic sketches. When the atomic sketches are Bloom filters and we apply them to PBF, HoppingSketch can achieve significantly higher temporal membership query accuracy than the original PBF. When the atomic sketches are sketches of Count-Min, Conservative Update, and Count, HoppingSketch can achieve more accurate frequency query than by applying PBF on the corresponding sketches. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of HoppingSketch compared with the state-of-the-art.

DE Field theory for human mobility; interpretable traffic prediction;

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental problem in spatiotemporal data mining. Most of the existing studies focuses on designing statistical models to fit historical traffic data, which are purely data-driven approaches and fail to reveal the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic. To address this issue, we propose the spatiotemporal potential energy field model (ST-PEF+), which applies the field theory for human mobility to interpret the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, and introduces the theory into data-driven deep learning models. ST-PEF+ consists of a PEF extraction module and a data-driven module. Inspired by the field theory for human mobility, the PEF extraction module adopts an algorithm to decompose the grid-based traffic flow graph into several polytree-based potential energy fields (PEFs), where traffic flows from high potential locations to low potential locations, just as water is driven by the gravity field. We also provide a theoretical analysis to ensure that the polytree decomposition algorithm can decompose any traffic flow graph. In the data-driven module, ST-PEF+ learns a spatiotemporal deep learning model to predict the dynamics of PEFs. The model adopts correlation-adaptive neural network structures, which consists of a temporal component for temporal correlations and a spatial component for spatial correlations. The temporal component employs a GRU and DCN combined structure to capture both short-term autocorrelation and long-term repeating patterns of PEFs. The spatial component extends the GAT using weighted directed attention to model the asymmetric spatial structure in PEFs. The prediction results of traffic flow are finally derived from PEFs that are predicted by the spatiotemporal deep learning model. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real-world traffic datasets. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, case studies confirm that the PEFs learned in our framework can reveal the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, thus improving the model interpretability.

ID PRIVACY PROTECTION
AB In a wide spectrum of real-world applications, it is very important to analyze and mine graph data such as social networks, communication networks, citation networks, and so on. However, the release of such graph data often raises privacy issue, and the graph privacy preservation has recently drawn much attention from the database community. While prior works on graph privacy preservation mainly focused on protecting the privacy of either the graph structure only or vertex attributes only, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for graph privacy preservation by considering attacks from both graph structures and vertex attributes, which transforms the original graph to a so-called kt-safe graph, via k-anonymity and t-closeness. We prove that the generation of a kt-safe graph is NP-hard, therefore, we propose a feasible framework for effectively and efficiently anonymizing a graph with low anonymization cost. In particular, we design a cost-model-based graph partitioning approach to enable our proposed divide-and-conquer strategy for the graph anonymization, and propose effective optimization techniques such as pruning method and a tree synopsis to improve the anonymization efficiency over large-scale graphs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed kt-safe graph generation approach on both real and synthetic data sets.

ID MODEL
AB Recently, deep learning techniques have yielded immense success on recommender systems. However, one weakness of most deep methods is that, users/items mutual semantic relationships, which are latent in the user-item interactions, are not distilled out explicitly. Moreover, most methods have been primarily focused on representation learning in euclidean geometry. Since recent studies have shown that the bipartite graph structure has the non-euclidean latent anatomy, euclidean embeddings may suffer from a certain degree of distortion. In this work, we present Hyperbolic Neural Collaborative Recommender (HNCR), a deep hyperbolic representation learning method that exploits mutual semantic relationships among users/items for collaborative filtering tasks. HNCR first introduces a neighbor construction strategy to build user and item semantic neighborhoods. Then HNCR develops a framework based on deep learning and hyperbolic geometry to integrate constructed neighborhoods into recommendation. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on the four datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of HNCR compared with its euclidean counterpart and state-of-the-art recommendation baselines. The results also indicate that hyperbolic representations can reflect meaningful data insights.

AB Graph embedding, which aims to learn low-dimensional node representations to preserve original graph structures, has attracted extensive research interests. However, most existing graph embedding models represent nodes in Euclidean spaces, which cannot effectively preserve complex patterns, e.g., hierarchical structures. Very recently, several hyperbolic embedding models have been proposed to preserve the hierarchical information in negative curvature spaces. Nevertheless, existing hyperbolic models fail to model the asymmetric proximity between nodes. To address this, we investigate a new asymmetric hyperbolic network representation problem, which targets at jointly preserving the hierarchical structures and asymmetric proximity for general directed graphs. We solve this problem by proposing a novel Rotated Lorentzian Embedding (ROLE) model, which yields two main benefits. First, our model can effectively capture both implicit and explicit hierarchical structures that come from the network topology and category information of nodes, respectively. Second, it can model the asymmetric proximity using rotation transformations. Specifically, we represent each node with a Lorentzian embedding vector, and learn two rotation matrices to reflect the direction of edges. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world directed graph datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art embedding models. In particular, ROLE achieves HR@1 scores up to 19.8% higher and NDCG@5 scores up to 11.3% higher than the best baselines on the task of node recommendation.

TI Latent Structure Mining With Contrastive Modality Fusion for Multimedia
   Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Multimedia recommendation; graph structure learning; contrastive
   learning
AB Multimedia contents are of predominance in the modern Web era. Recent years have witnessed growing research interests in multimedia recommendation, which aims to predict whether a user will interact with an item with multimodal contents. Most previous studies focus on modeling user-item interactions with multimodal features included as side information. However, this scheme is not well-designed for multimedia recommendation. First, only collaborative item-item relationships are implicitly modeled through high-order item-user-item co-occurrences. Considering that items are associated with rich contents in multiple modalities, we argue that the latent semantic item-item structures underlying these multimodal contents could be beneficial for learning better item representations and assist the recommender models to comprehensively discover candidate items. Second, although previous studies consider multiple modalities, their ways of fusing multiple modalities by linear combination or concatenation is insufficient to fully capture content information of items and item relationships. To address these deficiencies, we propose a latent structure MIning with ContRastive mOdality fusion model, which we term MICRO for brevity. To be specific, we devise a novel modality-aware structure learning module, which learns item-item relationships for each modality. Based on the learned modality-aware latent item relationships, we perform graph convolutions to explicitly inject item affinities into modality-aware item representations. Additionally, we design a novel multimodal contrastive framework to facilitate item-level multimodal fusion by mining both modality-shared and modality-specific information. Finally, the item representations are plugged into existing collaborative filtering methods to make accurate recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-arts and rationalize the design choice of our work.

TI Multivariate Time Series Forecasting With Dynamic Graph Neural ODEs

DT Article
DE Multivariate time series forecasting; graph neural networks; neural
   ordinary differential equations
AB Multivariate time series forecasting has long received significant attention in real-world applications, such as energy consumption and traffic prediction. While recent methods demonstrate good forecasting abilities, they have three fundamental limitations. (i). Discrete neural architectures: Interlacing individually parameterized spatial and temporal blocks to encode rich underlying patterns leads to discontinuous latent state trajectories and higher forecasting numerical errors. (ii). High complexity: Discrete approaches complicate models with dedicated designs and redundant parameters, leading to higher computational and memory overheads. (iii). Reliance on graph priors: Relying on predefined static graph structures limits their effectiveness and practicability in real-world applications. In this paper, we address all the above limitations by proposing a continuous model to forecast Multivariate Time series with dynamic Graph neural Ordinary Differential Equations (MTGODE). Specifically, we first abstract multivariate time series into dynamic graphs with time-evolving node features and unknown graph structures. Then, we design and solve a neural ODE to complement missing graph topologies and unify both spatial and temporal message passing, allowing deeper graph propagation and fine-grained temporal information aggregation to characterize stable and precise latent spatial-temporal dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate the superiorities of MTGODE from various perspectives on five time series benchmark datasets.

DE Sequential recommendation; collaborative filtering; counterfactual;
   causal inference
AB Sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention from the industry and academic communities. While previous models have achieved remarkable successes, an important problem may still hinder their performances, that is, the sparsity of the real-world data. In this paper, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation framework to alleviate the problem of data sparsity. In specific, our framework contains a sampler model and an anchor model. The sampler model aims to generate high-quality user behavior sequences, while the anchor model is trained based on the original and new generated samples, and leveraged to provide the final recommendation list. To implement the sampler model, we first design four types of heuristic methods based on either random or frequency-based strategies. And then, to improve the quality of the generated sequences, we propose two learning-based samplers by discovering the decision boundaries or increasing the sample informativeness. At last, we build an RL based model to automatically determine where to edit the history behaviors and how many items should be replaced. Considering that the sampler model can be imperfect, we, at last, analyze the influence of the noisy information contained in the generated sequences on the anchor model in theory, and design a simple but effective method to better serve the anchor model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

AB Feature selection can be used to solve imbalanced classification problems encountered in big data projects. There often exist multiple feature subsets achieving the same accuracy. These subsets tend to exhibit different acquisition difficulty and reliability, thus offering decision-makers with multiple choices if they can be well-identified. This work formulates feature selection as a Multimodal Multiobjective Problem (MMOP), where a point on Pareto front in objective space has multiple equivalent feature subsets in decision space. To seek more equivalent feature subsets, this work proposes a new multiobjective fireworks algorithm. It extends a latest single-objective fireworks algorithm to a multiobjective version such that it becomes suitable for solving MMOP. An adaptive strategy and special archive guidance are newly designed to improve its performance. A weighted extreme learning machine is chosen to classify datasets and return classification accuracy due to its fast learning speed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms its compared ones on 15 imbalanced classification datasets including 5 low-dimensional, 5 high-dimensional feature selection problems and 5 large-scale problems with larger imbalanced ratio, and its runtime is the least among them. Also, fault diagnosis in self-organizing cellular networks, as an important imbalance classification problem, is performed by the proposed algorithm and the results show that it can perform fault diagnosis well.

DE Kernel k-means; randomized sketching; statistical and computational
   trade-offs; excess risk bound
ID NYSTROM METHOD; MIXTURE; MATRIX
AB k-means is a fundamental unsupervised learning in data mining. Its computational requirements are typically at least quadratic in the number of data, which are prohibitive for large-scale scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel randomized sketching approach SKK based on the circulant matrix. SKK projects the kernel matrix left and right according to the proposed sketch matrices to obtain a smaller one and accelerates the matrix-matrix product by the fast Fourier transform based on the circulant matrix, which can greatly reduce the computational requirements of the approximate kernel k-means estimator with the same generalization bound as the exact kernel k-means in the statistical setting. In particular, theoretical analysis shows that taking the sketch dimension of vn is sufficient for SKK to achieve the optimal excess risk bound with only a fraction of computations, where n is the number of data. The extensive experiments verify our theoretical analysis, and SKK achieves the state-of-the-art performances on 12 real-world datasets. To the best of our knowledge, in randomized sketching, this is the first time that unsupervised learning makes such a significant breakthrough.

AB Different knowledge graphs for the same domain are often uniquely housed on the Web. Effectively linking entities from different graphs is critical for building an open and comprehensive knowledge graph. However, linking entities across different sources has thus far faced various challenges, including the increasingly large-scale volume of the data, the heterogeneity of the graphs, and the ambiguity of real-world entities. To address them, we propose a unified framework LinKG. Specifically, we decouple the problem into different linking tasks based on the unique properties of each type of entity. To link word sequence based entities, we propose an LSTM-based method to capture word dependencies. To link entities of large scale, we utilize the hashing technique and convolutional neural networks for scalable and accurate linking. To link ambiguous entities, we propose heterogeneous graph attention networks to leverage heterogeneous structural information. Finally, to validate the design choices of different LinKG modules, we characterize the relationships between different tasks based on the single-domain and multi-domain transfer models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LinKG with an overall F1-score of 95.15%, based on which we deploy and release the Open Academic Graph (OAG)-the largest publicly available heterogeneous academic graph to date.

TI Spectral Adversarial Training for Robust Graph Neural Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Adversarial training; graph neural networks; node classification;
   network robustness
AB Recent studies demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to slight but adversarially designed perturbations, known as adversarial examples. To address this issue, robust training methods against adversarial examples have received considerable attention in the literature. Adversarial Training (AT) is a successful approach to learning a robust model using adversarially perturbed training samples. Existing AT methods on GNNs typically construct adversarial perturbations in terms of graph structures or node features. However, they are less effective and fraught with challenges on graph data due to the discreteness of graph structure and the relationships between connected examples. In this work, we seek to address these challenges and propose Spectral Adversarial Training (SAT), a simple yet effective adversarial training approach for GNNs. SAT first adopts a low-rank approximation of the graph structure based on spectral decomposition, and then constructs adversarial perturbations in the spectral domain rather than directly manipulating the original graph structure. To investigate its effectiveness, we employ SAT on three widely used GNNs. Experimental results on four public graph datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly improves the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks without sacrificing classification accuracy and training efficiency.

ID MOVING BOTTLENECKS; SYSTEMS
AB Spatio-temporal forecasting has a wide range of applications in smart city efforts, such as traffic forecasting and air quality prediction. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (GCRNN) are the state-of-the-art methods for this problem, which learn temporal dependencies by RNNs and exploit pairwise node proximity to model spatial dependencies. However, the spatial relations in real data are not simply pairwise but sometimes in a higher order among multiple nodes. Moreover, spatio-temporal sequences deriving from nature are often regulated by known or unknown physical laws. GCRNNs rarely take into account the underlying physics in real-world systems, which may result in degenerated performance. To address these issues, we devise a general model called Mixed-Order Relation-Aware RNN (MixRNN+) for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, our MixRNN+ captures the complex mixed-order spatial relations of nodes through a newly proposed building block called Mixer, and simultaneously addressing the underlying physics by the integration of a new residual update strategy. Experimental results on three forecasting tasks in smart city applications (including traffic speed, taxi flow, and air quality prediction) demonstrate the superiority of our model against the state-of-the-art methods. We have also deployed a cloud-based system using our method as the bedrock model to show its practicality.

ID SET INTERSECTION; MULTIPARTY; INFORMATION
AB Skyline is a primitive operation in multi-objective decision applications and there is a growing demand to support such operations over a data federation, where the entire dataset is separately held by multiple data providers (a.k.a., silos). Data federations notably increase the amount of data available for data-intensive applications such as commercial recommendation and location based services. Yet they also challenge the conventional implementation of skyline queries because the raw data cannot be shared within the federation and the secure computation cross silos can be two or three orders of magnitude slower than plaintext computation. These constraints render existing solutions inefficient on data federation. In this work, we propose a novel local dominance based framework for efficient skyline queries over a vertical data federation. We decompose the skyline query into plaintext local dominance computations and secure result aggregations, which can perform as many computations in plaintext as possible without compromising security. We further propose a dedicate private set intersection based algorithm to accelerate the query processing. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that compared with general-purpose secure multi-party computation techniques, our solutions reduce the time cost by up to 35.4x and communication cost by two orders of magnitude respectively.

TI GRRS: Accurate and Efficient Neighborhood Rough Set for Feature
   Selection

ID ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; MODEL
AB Feature selection is an important preprocessing step in data mining and pattern recognition. The neighborhood rough set (NRS) model is a widely-used rough set model for feature selection on continuous data. All currently known NRS models are defined on a distance metric - mostly the euclidean distance metric - which invalidates the NRS models in scenarios wherein the euclidean distance is ineffective, for example, while considering differing attribute weights. We first introduce the concept of space division of granular-rectangular, and then construct the neighborhood radius in our method by describing the relationship between child and parent spaces, which avoids the use of a distance metric and reduces the search space for the neighborhood radius. This greatly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of NRS. In addition, the upper and lower approximations of the granular-rectangular rough sets (GRRSs) comprise equivalence classes; this results in better performance of GRRS in knowledge representation compared with the traditional NRS. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets reveal that our method, GRRS, achieves higher accuracy than ten popular and state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, including two NRS algorithms. Moreover, GRRS outperforms the established NRS algorithms regarding efficiency, including the state-of-the-art NRS algorithm, GBNRS. All code has been released as an open libary called GRRS: https://github.com/syxiaa/GRRS.

AB Data wrangling tasks such as obtaining and linking data from various sources, transforming data formats, and correcting erroneous records, can constitute up to 80% of typical data engineering work. Despite the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, data wrangling remains a tedious and manual task. We introduce AI assistants, a class of semi-automatic interactive tools to streamline data wrangling. An AI assistant guides the analyst through a specific data wrangling task by recommending a suitable data transformation that respects the constraints obtained through interaction with the analyst. We formally define the structure of AI assistants and describe how existing tools that treat data cleaning as an optimization problem fit the definition. We implement AI assistants for four common data wrangling tasks and make AI assistants easily accessible to data analysts in an open-source notebook environment for data science, by leveraging the common structure they follow. We evaluate our AI assistants both quantitatively and qualitatively through three example scenarios. We show that the unified and interactive design makes it easy to perform tasks that would be difficult to do manually or with a fully automatic tool.

ID MODEL
AB The current wave of AI is heavily driven by data, especially for cognitive capabilities. Minimization of data semantics not only reveals core information but also becomes a guide in a wide range of domains. However, scalability is theoretically weak in pure semantic methodologies. In order to cooperate with large DBs, expressiveness is over-sacrificed in existing techniques. Thus, the quality of discovered patterns and redundancies are far from satisfactory. In this article, we formalize symbolic minimization on relational DBs and prove its NP-Completeness. A lossless technique is proposed by inducing generic first-order Horn rules that infer a subset of records from the others. More importantly, we further improve the scalability via effective caching and pruning without sacrificing the expressiveness of first-order Horn rules. A concrete system is implemented and comprehensively evaluated. Experiments show that our technique removes up to 70% contents and outperforms the state-of-the-art on minimization and scalability. The optimizations reduce up to 96% memory consumption and accelerate the performance by two orders. Our technique shows the practicality of pure semantic approaches in database mining.

ID MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; KNOWLEDGE
AB Granular computing, a new paradigm for solving large-scale and complex problems, has made significant progresses in knowledge discovery. Granular ball computing (GBC) is a novel granular computing method, which can rapidly generate scalable and robust information granules, that is, granular balls. However, a comprehensive index for measuring the performance of a granular ball does not exist. Furthermore, GBC lacks a mechanism to deal with dynamic decision systems. Therefore, in this study, the quality index of a granular ball is first formulated. Next, with this index, a novel granular ball rough sets model (GBRS) based on GBC is proposed. GBRS is more conducive to learning knowledge from uncertain datasets and more suited to incremental learning than the latest granular ball neighborhood rough sets model based on GBC. Subsequently, an incremental mechanism is introduced into GBRS, and two incremental learning models are developed for objects increasing in stream patterns and batch patterns, respectively. In the incremental learning process, three patterns of granular balls, that is, update, fusion, and split, were well studied when a set of objects was added to the decision system. Finally, to verify the effectiveness and efficiency, we apply GBRS and these two incremental learning models into classification tasks. Compared with four current state-of-the-art classification methods based on granular computing and four classical classifiers in machine learning, the proposed classifiers in this paper achieve higher classification accuracy as well as better efficiency on benchmark datasets.

ID AUTHENTICATION
AB With the boom in cloud computing, data outsourcing in location-based services is proliferating and has attracted increasing interest from research communities and commercial applications. Nevertheless, since the cloud server is probably both untrusted and malicious, concerns about data security and result integrity have become on the rise sharply. In addition, in the single-user situation assumed by most existing works, query users can capture query content from each other even though the queries are encrypted, which may incur the leakage of query privacy. Unfortunately, there exists little work that can commendably assure data security and result integrity in the multi-user setting. To this end, in this article, we study the problem of multi-user, secure, and verifiable k nearest neighbor query (MSV k NN). To support MSV k NN, we first propose a novel unified structure, called verifiable and secure index (VSI). Based on this, we devise a series of secure protocols to facilitate query processing and develop a compact verification strategy. Given an MSV k NN query, our proposed solution can not merely answer the query efficiently while can guarantee: 1) preserving data privacy , query privacy , result privacy , and access patterns privacy; 2) authenticating the correctness and completeness of the results; 3) supporting multi-user with different keys. Finally, the formal security analysis and complexity analysis are theoretically proven and the performance and feasibility of our proposed approach are empirically evaluated and demonstrated.

TI Fast Gumbel-Max Sketch and its Applications

AB The well-known Gumbel-Max Trick for sampling elements from a categorical distribution (or more generally a non negative vector) and its variants have been widely used in areas such as machine learning and information retrieval. To sample a random element i in proportion to its positive weight v(i), the Gumbel-Max Trick first computes a Gumbel random variable g(i) for each positive weight element i, and then samples the element i with the largest value of g(i) + ln v(i). Recently, applications including similarity estimation and weighted cardinality estimation require to generate k independent Gumbel-Max variables from high dimensional vectors. However, it is computationally expensive for a large k (e.g., hundreds or even thousands) when using the traditional Gumbel-Max Trick. To solve this problem, we propose a novel algorithm, FastGM, which reduces the time complexity from O(kn(+)) to O(k ln k + n(+)), where n(+) is the number of positive elements in the vector of interest. FastGM stops the procedure of Gumbel random variables computing for many elements, especially for those with small weights. We perform experiments on a variety of real-world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that FastGM is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing accuracy or incurring additional expenses.

AB The pervasive view of the mobile crowd bridges various real-world scenes and people's perceptions with the gathering of distributed crowdsensing photos. To elaborate informative visuals for viewers, existing techniques introduce photo selection as an essential step in crowdsensing. Yet, the aesthetic preference of viewers, at the very heart of their experiences under various crowdsensing contexts (e.g., travel planning), is seldom considered and hardly guaranteed. We propose CrowdPicker, a novel photo selection framework with adaptive aesthetic awareness for crowdsensing. With the observations on aesthetic uncertainty and bias in different crowdsensing contexts, we exploit a joint effort of mobile crowdsourcing and domain adaptation to actively learn contextual knowledge for dynamically tailoring the aesthetic predictor. Concretely, an aesthetic utility measure is invented based on the probabilistic balance formalization to quantify the benefit of photos in improving the adaptation performance. We prove the NP-hardness of sampling the best-utility photos for crowdsourcing annotation and present a (1-1/e) approximate solution. Furthermore, a two-stage distillation-based adaptation architecture is designed based on fusing contextual and common aesthetic preferences. Extensive experiments on three datasets and four raw models demonstrate the performance superiority of CrowdPicker over four photo selection baselines and four typical sampling strategies. Cross-dataset evaluation illustrates the impacts of aesthetic bias on selection.

TI High-Quality Temporal Link Prediction for Weighted Dynamic Graphs via
   Inductive Embedding Aggregation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Temporal link prediction; weighted dynamic graphs; inductive dynamic
   graph embedding
AB Temporal link prediction (TLP) is an inference task on dynamic graphs that predicts future topology using historical graph snapshots. Existing TLP methods are usually designed for unweighted graphs with fixed node sets. Some of them cannot be generalized to the prediction of weighted graphs with non-fixed node sets. Although several methods can still be used to predict weighted graphs, they can only derive low-quality prediction snapshots sensitive to large edge weights but fail to distinguish small and zero weights in adjacency matrices. In this study, we consider the challenging high-quality TLP on weighted dynamic graphs and propose a novel inductive dynamic embedding aggregation (IDEA) method, inspired by the high-resolution video prediction. IDEA combines conventional error minimization objectives with a scale difference minimization objective, which can generate high-quality weighted prediction snapshots, distinguishing differences among large, small, and zero weights in adjacency matrices. Since IDEA adopts an inductive dynamic embedding scheme with an attentive node aligning unit and adaptive embedding aggregation module, it can also tackle the TLP on weighted graphs even with non-fixed node sets. Experiments on datasets of various scenarios validate that IDEA can derive high-quality prediction results for weighted dynamic graphs and tackle the variation of node sets.

ID FUSION
AB Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) is challenging, as it requires adequately exploring complementary and consistency information under the incompleteness of data. Most existing approaches attempt to overcome the incompleteness at instance-level. In this work, we develop a new approach to facilitate IMVC from a new perspective. Specifically, we transfer the issue of missing instances to a similarity graph completion problem for incomplete views, and propose a self-supervised multi-view graph completion algorithm to infer the associated missing entries. Further, by incorporating constrained feature learning, the inferred graph can be naturally leveraged in representation learning. We theoretically show that our feature learning process performs an Auto-Regressive filter function by encoding the learned similarity graph, which could yield discriminative representation for a clustering task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

   reviews
AB Although some existing models are proposed to exploit reviews for improving performance for recommender systems, few of them can handle the following issues led by the insufficient review data: (i) The regular training process does not exactly fit the scenario of preference prediction with few historical behaviors. (ii) Extracting informative and sufficient semantic features from limited review texts is a challenging work. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes an enhanced prototypical network, FS-EPN, that leverages reviews for recommendation under the few-shot setting. FS-EPN consists of an attentional prototypical network being the basic architecture, a sentiment encoder and a memory collector cooperating to capture the extra sentimental and collaborative information from both user and item perspectives for semantic information supplement. We train FS-EPN under the meta-learning framework, which models the training process in the episodic manner to mimic the few-shot test environment. Extensive experiments conducted on six publicly available datasets demonstrate the superior capability of FS-EPN over several state-of-the-art models in few-shot recommendation.

TI Maximal Clique Search in Weighted Graphs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE k-clique; graph queries; index construction; weighted graphs
AB Searching for k-cliques in graphs has been an important problem in graph analysis due to its large number of applications. Previously, finding k-cliques in weighted graphs aimed at finding cliques with the largest sum of weight (with no distinction between the edge or the vertex weights), usually called the sum model. However, the algorithms under the sum model may result in solutions consisting of low-weight vertices or edges (outliers). To address this issue, we propose a new model named maximal (S, C, K)-clique in weighted graphs and study the problem of maximal (S, C, K)-clique search (MCS). We first propose an enumeration-based algorithm MCSE, which checks every k-clique to identify the maximal (S, C, K)-clique. To improve the efficiency, we further propose two improved algorithms MCSP and MCSC. Instead of checking every possible k-clique, MCSP focuses on (S, C) values that cannot be dominated and obtains the maximal (S, C, K)-cliques directly based on these values. MCSC is devised by further optimizing MCSP based on some key observations on maximal cliques and cliques' nesting property. We also propose two index structures, BCS-Index and ICS-Index, to achieve optimal query. The former stores all maximal (S, C, K)-cliques, while the latter uses the clique's nesting property to reduce the space cost of index construction. Extensive experiments conducted on six real graphs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

AB Trip itinerary recommendation finds an ordered sequence of Points-of-Interest (POIs) from a large number of candidate POIs in a city. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework, called DeepAltTrip, that learns to recommend top -k alternative itineraries for given source and destination POIs. These alternative itineraries would be not only popular given the historical routes adopted by past users but also dissimilar (or diverse) to each other. The DeepAltTrip consists of two major components: (i) Itinerary Net (ITRNet) which estimates the likelihood of POIs on an itinerary by using graph autoencoders and two (forward and backward) LSTMs; and (ii) a route generation procedure to generate k diverse itineraries passing through relevant POIs obtained using ITRNet. For the route generation step, we propose a novel sampling algorithm that can seamlessly handle a wide variety of user-defined constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns from historical trips to provide a set of alternative itineraries to the users. Extensive experiments conducted on eight popular real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficacy of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.

TI HGNAS plus plus : Efficient Architecture Search for Heterogeneous Graph
   Neural Networks

DE Generative adversarial learning; graph neural networks; heterogeneous
   graphs; neural architecture search; reinforcement learning
AB Heterogeneous graphs are commonly used to describe networked data with multiple types of nodes and edges. Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing heterogeneous graphs. However, designing neural architectures of HGNNs requires extensive domain knowledge and time-consuming manual work. Recently, neural architecture search algorithms have become popular in automatically designing neural architectures for homogeneous graph neural networks. In this paper, we present a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Architecture Search algorithm (HGNAS for short) which allows the automatic design of heterogeneous graph neural architectures. Specifically, HGNAS first designs a new search space based on existing popular HGNNs. Then, HGNAS uses a policy network as the controller to sample and find the best neural architecture from the designed search space by maximizing the expected accuracy of the selected architectures on a given validation dataset. Moreover, we design a new method HGNAS++ to improve the efficiency of HGNAS by training the RNN controller within a generative adversarial learning framework. The basic idea of HGNAS++ is to embed a pairwise ranker into the reinforcement learning based architecture search algorithm. The pairwise ranker can be taken as a discriminator which selects more accurate architectures between pairs of candidate architectures. Then, the RNN controller can be updated more efficiently by only using a relatively small number of candidate architectures selected by the pairwise ranker. Experiments on real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that HGNAS is capable of designing novel HGNNs that beat the best human-invented HGNNs. On the benchmark datasets, HGNAS++ improves HGNAS in terms of evaluation cost, with a reduction of 50% of the evaluated candidate architectures and a decrease of 24% in search time on average. As a byproduct, HGNAS++ can find sparse yet powerful neural architectures for HGNNs.

ID IMPLICIT FEEDBACK
AB Knowledge graph (KG) enhanced recommendation, which aims to solve the cold start and explainability in recommender systems, has attracted considerable research interest recently. Existing recommender systems usually focus on implicit feedback such as purchase history without negative feedback. Most of them apply the negative sampling strategy to deal with the implicit feedback data, which may ignore the latent positive user-item interaction. Some other works adopt the non-sampling strategy that treats all non-observed interactions as negative samples and assigns a weight for each negative sample to represent the probability that this sample is a positive sample. However, they use a simple and intuitive weight assignment strategy and cannot catch the latent relationship from all interaction data. To address these problems, we consider graph structure information of both user-item interaction and knowledge graph, and propose a Graph-based Non-Sampling strategy to achieve efficient performance in Knowledge graph enhanced Recommendation (GNSKR). GNSKR utilizes node centrality to significantly improve recommendation performance with low computation cost. Meanwhile, we combine knowledge graph embedding and recommendation task with a local aggregation block, which efficiently catches the high-order connection information in KG enhanced recommendation. Experiments on three datasets show that GNSKR embraces the state-of-the-art with competitive efficiency.

TI Towards Hard Few-Shot Relation Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Contrastive learning; few-shot learning; prototypical networks; relation
   classification
AB Few-shot relation classification (FSRC) focuses on recognizing novel relations by learning with merely a handful of annotated instances. Meta-learning has been widely adopted for such a task, which trains on randomly generated few-shot tasks to learn generic data representations. Despite impressive results achieved, existing models still perform suboptimally when handling hard FSRC tasks with similar categories that confuse the model to distinguish correctly. We argue this is largely due to two reasons, 1) ignoring pivotal and discriminate information that is crucial to distinguish confusing classes, and 2) training indiscriminately via randomly sampled tasks of varying difficulty. In this article, we introduce a novel prototypical network approach with contrastive learning that learns more informative and discriminative representations by exploiting relation label information. We further design two strategies that increase the difficulty of training tasks and allow the model to adaptively learn to focus on hard tasks. By doing so, our model can better represent subtle inter-relation variance and grow up through task difficulty. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TI Selective Imputation for Multivariate Time Series Datasets With Missing

DE Multivariate time series; missing data; imputation; irregular sampling
ID COMPONENTS
AB Multivariate time series often contain missing values for reasons such as failures in data collection mechanisms. Since these missing values can complicate the analysis of time series data, imputation techniques are typically used to deal with this issue. However, the quality of the imputation directly affects the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a selective imputation method that identifies a subset of timesteps with missing values to impute in a multivariate time series dataset. This selection, which will result in shorter and simpler time series, is based on both reducing the uncertainty of the imputations and representing the original time series as good as possible. In particular, the method uses multi-objective optimization techniques to select the optimal set of points, and in this selection process, we leverage the beneficial properties of the Multi-task Gaussian Process (MGP). The method is applied to different datasets to analyze the quality of the imputations and the performance obtained in downstream tasks, such as classification or anomaly detection. The results show that much shorter and simpler time series are able to maintain or even improve both the quality of the imputations and the performance of the downstream tasks.

ID BOOTSTRAP; ALGORITHMS
AB The emergence of massive data in recent years brings challenges to automatic statistical inference. This is particularly true if the data are too numerous to be read into memory as a whole. Accordingly, new sampling techniques are needed to sample data from a hard drive. In this paper, we propose a sequential addressing subsampling (SAS) method that can sample data directly from the hard drive. The newly proposed SAS method is time saving in terms of addressing cost compared to that of the random addressing subsampling (RAS) method. Estimators (e.g., the sample mean) based on the SAS subsamples are constructed, and their properties are studied. We conduct a series of simulation studies to verify the finite sample performance of the proposed SAS estimators. The time cost is also compared between the SAS and RAS methods. An analysis of the airline data is presented for illustration purpose.

AB Attribute-based signature (ABS) is a versatile and useful cryptogrammic technology. In an ABS scheme, every signer is distributed a signing secret key in term of her/his attributes, and endorses a message in relation to some signing policy fulfilled by the signer's attributes. The verifier checks that the signature is indeed endorsed by the signer whose attributes match with the signing policy. However, existing ABS schemes suffer from the issue of abusing signature and key exposure. To address the above issues, we provide a traceable and forward-secure attribute-based signature (TFS-ABS) scheme with constant-size supporting flexible threshold predicates. Furthermore, we prove that the presented TFS-ABS scheme is existential unforgeability against selective predicate attack under the standard model. We reduce the security for the provided scheme to q-Diffie-Hellman exponentiation assumption. The designed scheme can be used to alleviate the damage induced by key exposure and traces the real identity of signer by attribute authority (AA) when the signer occurs abusing behavior. Furthermore, the signature size in presented scheme keeps constant and is independent of the number of attributes. Experimental evaluations exhibit that the presented TFS-ABS scheme is efficient in term of the communication and computation overhead.

ID PATTERNS
AB The aim of sequential pattern mining (SPM) is to discover potentially useful information from a given sequence. Although various SPM methods have been investigated, most of these focus on mining all of the patterns. However, users sometimes want to mine patterns with the same specific prefix pattern, called co-occurrence pattern. Since sequential rule mining can make better use of the results of SPM, and obtain better recommendation performance, this paper addresses the issue of maximal co-occurrence nonoverlapping sequential rule (MCoR) mining and proposes the MCoR-Miner algorithm. To improve the efficiency of support calculation, MCoR-Miner employs depth-first search and backtracking strategies equipped with an indexing mechanism to avoid the use of sequential searching. To obviate useless support calculations for some sequences, MCoR-Miner adopts a filtering strategy to prune the sequences without the prefix pattern. To reduce the number of candidate patterns, MCoR-Miner applies the frequent item and binomial enumeration tree strategies. To avoid searching for the maximal rules through brute force, MCoR-Miner uses a screening strategy. To validate the performance of MCoR-Miner, eleven competitive algorithms were conducted on eight sequences. Our experimental results showed that MCoR-Miner outperformed other competitive algorithms, and yielded better recommendation performance than frequent co-occurrence pattern mining. All algorithms and datasets can be downloaded from https://github.com/wuc567/Pattern-Mining/tree/master/MCoR-Miner.

TI A Distributed Privacy-Preserving Learning Dynamics in General Social

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Distributed learning; privacy preservation; social networks
AB In this article, we study a distributed privacy-preserving learning problem in social networks with general topology. The agents can communicate with each other over the network, which may result in privacy disclosure, since the trustworthiness of the agents cannot be guaranteed. Given a set of options which yield unknown stochastic rewards, each agent is required to learn the best one, aiming at maximizing the resulting expected average cumulative reward. To serve the above goal, we propose a four-staged distributed algorithm which efficiently exploits the collaboration among the agents while preserving the local privacy for each of them. In particular, our algorithm proceeds iteratively, and in every round, each agent i) randomly perturbs its adoption for the privacy-preserving purpose, ii) disseminates the perturbed adoption over the social network in a nearly uniform manner through random walking, iii) selects an option by referring to the perturbed suggestions received from its peers, and iv) decides whether or not to adopt the selected option as preference according to its latest reward feedback. Through solid theoretical analysis, we quantify the trade-off among the number of agents (or communication overhead), privacy preserving and learning utility. We also perform extensive simulations to verify the efficacy of our proposed social learning algorithm.

TI Multi-Party Sequential Data Publishing Under Differential Privacy
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Index Terms-Data publishing; differential privacy; multiple party;
   sequential dataset
ID ALGORITHM
AB Given a set of local sequential datasets held by multiple parties, we study the problem of publishing a synthetic dataset that preserves approximate sequentiality information of the integrated dataset while satisfying differential privacy for each local dataset. The existing solutions for publishing differentially private sequential data in the centralized setting mostly adopt tree-based approaches. Such approaches rely on different tree structures that encode sequential data's statistical information. The construction of a tree structure is normally done by recursively splitting nodes whose noisy scores (e.g., entropy or count) are larger than a given threshold. However, extending similar ideas to the multi-party setting is challenging. First, the comparison between noisy scores and a given threshold needs to be done in a distributed manner without letting the parties know the noisy scores, while satisfying differential privacy for each local dataset. Second, in the multi-party setting the large number of node splitting decisions incurs prohibitive computation costs. In addressing the above challenges, we present DPST, a distributed prediction suffix tree construction solution. In DPST, we first introduce a novel node splitting decision method that calculates the comparison result under encryption with substantially improved efficiency. Then we present a novel batch-based tree construction approach to reduce computation costs. In order to achieve high parallel performance without incurring any extra communication cost, we introduce the conjunction and slide methods to ensure that each batch contains a stable number of carefully arranged decision tasks. To further reduce communication and computation costs, we propose a prefix-based pre-pruning method to reduce the number of nodes that need to be judged whether to split by an interactive protocol. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our DPST solution offers desirable data utility with low computation and communication costs.

AB To optimize the processing of spatial queries, there is an increasing interest in combining spatial index structures with modern storage devices like flash-based Solid State Drives, PCM, and 3D Xpoint. These devices have several advantages compared to classical Hard Disk Drives, such as lower power consumption, and faster reads and writes. However, modern storage devices have changed the paradigm of data management because of their intrinsic characteristics, such as asymmetric read and write costs. Intending to exploit the benefits of modern storage devices, the development of spatial index structures for these devices has been an emerging research topic with recent and constant advances in the literature. This includes the adaptation of existing spatial index structures like the R-tree, or even the design of innovative structures. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey that highlights the key ideas, compares the main characteristics, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of spatial index structures for modern storage devices. Further, we study how experimental evaluations have been conducted to empirically compare these structures. Finally, we discuss challenges and identify potential future trends when indexing spatial data in this era of modern storage devices.

DE Index Terms-Clustering; excess risk; imbalanced data; learning bound
ID PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; MODEL
AB Imbalanced clustering, where the number of samples varies in different clusters, has arisen from many real data mining applications. It has gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, due to its unsupervised nature, imbalanced clustering is more challenging than its supervised counterpart, i.e., imbalanced classification. Furthermore, existing imbalanced clustering methods are empirically designed and they often lack solid theoretical guarantees, e.g., the excess risk estimation. To solve these important but rarely studied problems, we first propose a novel $k$k-Means algorithm for imbalanced clustering problem with Adaptive Cluster Weight (MACW), together with its excess clustering risk bound analysis. Inspired by this theoretical result, we further propose an improved algorithm called Imbalanced Clustering with Theoretical Learning Bounds (ICTLB). It refines the weights and encourages the optimal trade-off among per-cluster weights by optimizing the excess clustering risk bound. A theoretically-principled justification of ICTLB is provided for verification. Comprehensive experiments on many imbalanced datasets verify the effectiveness of ICTLB in solving cluster imbalanced problems.

AB We propose LightNE 2.0, a cost-effective, scalable, automated, and high-quality network embedding system that scales to graphs with hundreds of billions of edges on a single machine. In contrast to the mainstream belief that distributed architecture and GPUs are needed for large-scale network embedding with good quality, we prove that we can achieve higher quality, better scalability, lower cost, and faster runtime with shared-memory, CPU-only architecture. LightNE 2.0 combines two theoretically grounded embedding methods NetSMF and ProNE. We introduce the following techniques to network embedding for the first time: (1) a newly proposed downsampling method to reduce the sample complexity of NetSMF while preserving its theoretical advantages; (2) a high-performance parallel graph processing stack GBBS to achieve high memory efficiency and scalability; (3) sparse parallel hash table to aggregate and maintain the matrix sparsifier in memory; (4) a fast randomized singular value decomposition (SVD) enhanced by power iteration and fast orthonormalization to improve vanilla randomized SVD in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness; (5) Intel MKL for proposed fast randomized SVD and spectral propagation; and (6) a fast and lightweight AutoML library FLAML for automated hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show that LightNE 2.0 can be up to 84x faster than GraphVite, 30x faster than PBG and 9x faster than NetSMF while delivering better performance. LightNE 2.0 can embed very large graph with 1.7 billion nodes and 124 billion edges in half an hour on a CPU server, while other baselines cannot handle very large graphs of this scale.

TI Zone-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning for Urban POI
   Recommendation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Embedding; interpretability; POI recommendation; zone-enhanced model
AB Points-of-interest (POIs) recommendation plays a vital role in location-based social networks (LBSNs) by introducing unexplored POIs to consumers and has drawn extensive attention from academia and industry. Existing POI recommender systems usually learn fixed latent vectors to represent both consumers and POIs from historical check-ins and make recommendations under the spatio-temporal constraints. However, we argue that the existing works still suffer from the challenges of explaining consumers' complicated check-in actions. To this end, we first explore the interpretability of recommendations from the POI aspect, i.e., for a specific POI, its function usually changes over time, so representing a POI with a single fixed latent vector is not sufficient to describe the dynamic nature of POIs. Besides, check-in actions to a POI are also affected by the zone where it is located. In other words, the zone's embedding learned from POI distributions, road segments, and historical check-ins could be jointly utilized to enhance POI embeddings. Along this line, we propose a Time-zone-space POI embedding model (ToP), which integrates multi-knowledge graphs and topic model to introduce not only spatio-temporal effects but also sentiment constraints into POI embeddings for strengthening interpretability of recommendation. Specifically, ToP learns multiple latent vectors for a POI in a different period with spatial constraints via knowledge graph learning. To add sentiment constraints, ToP jointly combines these vectors with the zone's representations learned by topic models to make explainable recommendations. ToP considers the time, space, and sentiment of POI in a unified embedding framework, which benefits the POI recommendations. Extensive experiments on real-world Changchun city datasets demonstrate that ToP achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of common metrics and provides more insights for consumers' POI check-in actions.

TI A Trend of AI Conference Convergence in Similarity: An Empirical Study
   Through Trans-Temporal Heterogeneous Graph
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Academic conference; heterogeneous graph; trans-temporal
AB Publishing the research works on academic publications is an important part of the scientific process. Since the development of computer science research is very fast, researchers tend to publish the research works in a fast way, such as conferences whose review processes are faster than the journals. In the past decades, one conference usually focuses on a specific research field and the topic or method overlap between conferences is low. We have noticed that, in recent years, some topics or methods which were once studied in a small number of specific research fields have become popular in many other fields. Naturally, we come up with two research questions: (1) Do the conferences indeed become similar? and (2) How do conferences become similar? In this paper, we first use a trans-temporal heterogeneous graph network to model academic conferences in recent 20 years. Due to the large number of conferences, we categorize these conferences into 6 research fields for brevity. Then, we first quantitatively and qualitatively assess "Do the research fields become similar?" and then focus on exploring "How do research fields become similar?". From the result, we find the reason for the research fields in computer science become similar is that AI becomes pervasive and researchers tend to apply the machine learning methods to different application fields. Since the methods become universal between different research fields, researchers should pay more attention to advanced information in other fields to motivate more interdisciplinary works. To assist the researchers to explore related interdisciplinary advanced information, it is crucial to measure the cross-field impact of papers using the citation information and recommend the paper which has a high cross-field impact on the related researchers. As for the newly published papers which do not have any citations, we also propose a cross-field impact prediction model to recommend the cutting-edge research works to related researchers accurately. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Time-Aware Dynamic Graph Embedding for Asynchronous Structural Evolution
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Index Terms-Dynamic graph embedding; graph evolution; edge timespan;
   graph mining
AB Dynamic graphs refer to graphs whose structure dynamically changes over time. Despite the benefits of learning vertex representations (i.e., embeddings) for dynamic graphs, existing works merely view a dynamic graph as a sequence of changes within the vertex connections, neglecting the crucial asynchronous nature of such dynamics where the evolution of each local structure starts at different times and lasts for various durations. To maintain asynchronous structural evolutions within the graph, we innovatively formulate dynamic graphs as temporal edge sequences associated with joining time of vertices (ToV) and timespan of edges (ToE). Then, a time-aware Transformer is proposed to embed vertices' dynamic connections and ToEs into the learned vertex representations. Meanwhile, we treat each edge sequence as a whole and embed its ToV of the first vertex to further encode the time-sensitive information. Extensive evaluations on several datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in a wide range of graph mining tasks. At the same time, it is very efficient and scalable for embedding large-scale dynamic graphs.

TI Multi-View Scholar Clustering With Dynamic Interest Tracking
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Multi-view; scholar clustering; topic modeling
ID EVOLUTION
AB Scholar clustering has garnered increasing attention due to the explosive growth of scholar data. Although researchers have proposed many algorithms to cluster scholars, they typically focus on clustering scholars from the intrinsic view (scholars' contents). These algorithms may lead to inaccurate and biased clustering results because they ignore the extrinsic view (scholar's specialty) and the changeability of scholars' interest in each view. In this paper, we propose a multi-view scholar clustering topic model (MSCT), which integrates complementary information from both intrinsic and extrinsic views while considering dynamic scholar interests. Specifically, MSCT involves two novel schemes. The first one is multi-view integration, where MSCT collaboratively tracks scholars' time-varying topic distribution from two views: intrinsic view and extrinsic view. The former exploits the details of different academic degrees in the title and information in the abstract; the latter leverages the specialty of different categories in the corresponding research field and research discipline. The second one is dynamic interest tracking, which dynamically models each scholar's interest distribution in terms of the current scholar texts and previously estimated distribution through a newly designed collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that MSCT can significantly outperform state-of-the-art algorithms.

TI Hierarchical Interdisciplinary Topic Detection Model for Research
   Proposal Classification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DE Natural language processing; classification algorithms
AB The peer merit review of research proposals has been the major mechanism to decide grant awards. However, research proposals have become increasingly interdisciplinary. It has been a longstanding challenge to assign interdisciplinary proposals to appropriate reviewers so proposals are fairly evaluated. One of the critical steps in reviewer assignment is to generate accurate interdisciplinary topic labels for proposal-reviewer matching. Existing systems mainly collect topic labels manually generated by principle investigators. However, such human-reported labels can be non-accurate, incomplete, labor intensive, and time costly. What role can AI play in developing a fair and precise proposal reviewer assignment system? In this study, we collaborate with the National Science Foundation of China to address the task of automated interdisciplinary topic path detection. For this purpose, we develop a deep Hierarchical Interdisciplinary Research Proposal Classification Network (HIRPCN). Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical transformer to extract the textual semantic information of proposals. We then design an interdisciplinary graph and leverage GNNs to learn representations of each discipline in order to extract interdisciplinary knowledge. After extracting the semantic and interdisciplinary knowledge, we design a level-wise prediction component to fuse the two types of knowledge representations and detect interdisciplinary topic paths for each proposal. We conduct extensive experiments and expert evaluations on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

TI Effective and Efficient Lexicographical Order Dependency Discovery
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING

DT Article
DE Data dependency; data profiling; metadata
AB Lexicographical order dependencies state relationships of order between lists of attributes. They naturally model the order-by clauses in SQL queries, and are proven useful in query optimizations concerning sorting. Despite their importance, order dependencies on a dataset are typically unknown and are too costly, if not impossible, to design or discover manually. Techniques for automatic order dependency discovery are recently studied. It is challenging for order dependency discovery to scale well, since it is by nature factorial in the number m of attributes and quadratic in the number n of tuples. In this article, we adopt a strategy that decouples the impact of m from that of n, and that still finds all minimal and valid lexicographical order dependencies. We present carefully designed data structures, a host of algorithms and optimizations, and an enhanced strategy combined with multithreaded parallelism, for an efficient implementation. Using a host of real-life and synthetic datasets, we experimentally verify our approach is up to orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods, and can deliver better results with an improved definition of minimal attribute lists.

TI Deep Tabular Data Modeling With Dual-Route Structure-Adaptive Graph

AB Thanks to the inherent spatial or sequential structures underlying the data like images and texts, deep architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the Transformer have been recognized as the preeminent approaches in image processing and language modeling. In the real world, there are a large number of tabular data without any explicit structures, which breaks the inductive bias of most neural networks like CNNs. Although multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) obtain empirical success on tabular data, they cannot well explain the underlying relationship between multiple variables. Compared with other fields, research on deep models toward tabular data has received relatively less scrutiny. To bridge this gap, we propose Dual-Route Structure-Adaptive Graph Networks (DRSA-Net) to model the nonlinearity in tabular feature vectors without any prior. DRSA-Net adaptively learns a sparse graph structure between variables and then characterizes interactions between them from the view of dual-route message passing. We demonstrate that DRSA-Net could easily degenerate into the typical MLPs and factorization machines (FMs). Extensive experiments on recommendations, images (no spatial information after preprocessing), and some benchmark machine learning datasets show that DRSA-Net achieves comparable or superior performance with many classic algorithms and recently proposed deep models.

AB Prior research has introduced a new scenario of blockchain-assisted clouds where the data owner outsources original data to cloud servers and stores some metadata on the blockchain. Despite some research on key-value query and range query in this hybrid-storage scenario, other more complicated data types are not yet supported. In this article, we conduct pioneering research on authenticated queries for graph data, which is a popular data type such as the knowledge graph data, on the blockchain-assisted cloud. The primary challenge is how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that supports authenticated queries and can be easily maintained by the blockchain. To this end, we propose a novel ADS, named PAGB, based on the RSA accumulator and completeness set. It can also prevent the original data from being revealed to the public through blockchain or irrelevant queries. We further optimize our design to be more efficient in terms of communication and computation. The effectiveness and efficiency of PAGB are verified through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

TI An Efficient Spectral Clustering Algorithm Based on Granular-Ball

AB In order to solve the problem that the traditional spectral clustering algorithm is time-consuming and resource consuming when applied to large-scale data, resulting in poor clustering effect or even unable to cluster, this paper proposes a spectral clustering algorithm based on granular-ball(GBSC). The algorithm changes the construction method of the similarity matrix. Based on granular-ball, the size of the similarity matrix is greatly reduced, and the construction of the similarity matrix is more reasonable. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better speedup ratio, less memory consumption and stronger anti noise performance while achieving similar clustering results to the traditional spectral clustering algorithm. Suppose the number of granular-balls is m, n is the number of points in the dataset, and m << n, the time complexity of GBSC is O(m(3)). It is proved that GBSC has good adaptability to large-scale datasets. All codes have been released at https://github.com/xjnine/GBSC.

AB Parallel fractional hot-deck imputation (P-FHDI (Yang et al. 2020)) is a general-purpose, assumption-free tool for handling item nonresponse in big incomplete data by combining the theory of FHDI and parallel computing. FHDI cures multi-variate missing data by filling each missing unit with multiple observed values (thus, hot-deck) without resorting to distributional assumptions. P-FHDI can tackle big incomplete data with millions of instances (big -n) or 10,000 variables (big -p). However, handling ultra incomplete data (i.e., concurrently big -n and big -p) with tremendous instances and high dimensionality has posed problems to P-FHDI due to excessive memory requirement and execution time. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose the ultra data-oriented P-FHDI (named UP-FHDI) capable of curing ultra incomplete data. In addition to the parallel Jackknife method, this paper enables a computationally efficient ultra data-oriented variance estimation using parallel linearization techniques. Results confirm that UP-FHDI can tackle an ultra dataset with one million instances and 10,000 variables. This paper illustrates the special parallel algorithms of UP-FHDI and confirms its positive impact on the subsequent deep learning performance.

AB Dispatching vehicle fleets to serve flights is a key task in airport ground handling (AGH). Due to the notable growth of flights, it is challenging to simultaneously schedule multiple types of operations (services) for a large number of flights, where each type of operation is performed by one specific vehicle fleet. To tackle this issue, we first represent the operation scheduling as a complex vehicle routing problem and formulate it as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Then given the graph representation of the MILP model, we propose a learning assisted large neighborhood search (LNS) method using data generated based on real scenarios, where we integrate imitation learning and graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn a destroy operator to automatically select variables, and employ an off-the-shelf solver as the repair operator to reoptimize the selected variables. Experimental results based on a real airport show that the proposed method allows for handling up to 200 flights with 10 types of operations simultaneously, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the learned method performs consistently accompanying different solvers, and generalizes well on larger instances, verifying the versatility and scalability of our method.

DT Article
DE Index Terms-Spatial crowdsourcing; task assignment; worker churn
AB The pervasiveness of GPS-enabled devices and wireless communication technologies flourish the market of Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC), which consists of location-based tasks and requires workers to be at specific locations physically to complete them. In this work, we study the problem of worker-churn-based task assignment in SC, where tasks are assigned by considering workers' churn. In particular, we aim to maximize the total rewards of task assignments based on the worker churn prediction. To solve the problem, we propose a two-phase framework, which consists of a worker churn prediction and a task assignment phase. In the first phase, we use an LSTM-based model to extract latent feelings of workers based on historical data and then estimate idle time intervals of workers. In the assignment phase, we design an efficient greedy algorithm and a Kuhn-Munkras-based algorithm that can achieve the optimal task assignment. To improve the accuracy of the idle time interval estimation for workers, we adopt a context-dependent LSTM model, which involves interactions between inputs and their context. We further optimize the original task assignment framework by proposing a travel distance optimization strategy to reduce the overall travel distance. Extensive experiments offer insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions.

TI A Methodology to Quickly Perform Opinion Mining and Build Supervised

AB Social Networking Sites (SNS) offer a full set of possibilities to perform opinion studies such as polling or market analysis. Normally, artificial intelligence techniques are applied, and they often require supervised datasets. The process of building these is complex, time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose to assist the labelling task by taking advantage of social network mechanics. In order to do that, we introduce the co-retweet relation to build a graph that allows us to propagate user labels to their similarity neighbourhood. Therefore, it is possible to iteratively build supervised datasets with significant less human effort and with higher accuracy than other weak-supervision techniques. We tested our proposal with 3 datasets labelled by an expert committee, and results shows that it outperforms other weak-supervision techniques. This methodology may be adapted to other social networks and topics, and it is relevant for applications like informed decision-making (e.g., content moderation), specially when interpretability is required.

AB This paper addresses the problem of Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM), which refers to an air transportation system wherein unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are used to deliver small payloads on-demand by safely maneuvering in the low-altitude known urban infrastructure inhabited by dynamic air traffic. A multi-stage framework based on numerical potential fields is proposed for establishing UTM in the non-segregated airspace. Numerical potential fields are adopted for global path planning as they provide optimum stand-off clearance from obstacles in the environment. The proposed global path planning approach is augmented with a prediction-based zone determination algorithm to minimize high-density air traffic encounters by the UAS. In the event of low-density traffic in the vicinity of the UAS, the UAS neighborhood is sectorized into octants. An octant-based local collision avoidance strategy generates force fields that divert the UAS into a vacant octant. Extensive simulations have been carried out to show the efficacy of the proposed method in dense urban settings.

TI Unsupervised image segmentation with robust virtual class contrast
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS

DT Article
DE Unsupervised image segmentation; Contrastive learning
AB Unsupervised Image Segmentation (UIS) is a challenging problem in computer vision that aims to classify pixels in an image into different semantic classes without using any labels. Among the various UIS methods, Mask Contrast performs well when dealing with complex objects containing lots of detail. It utilizes prior knowledge from a pretrained saliency detection model to identify foreground pixels and leverages contrastive learning to learn the representations of those foreground pixels. However, this method is not designed to handle situations where foreground pixels belong to multiple semantic classes. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel method for UIS called Robust Virtual Class Contrast (RVCC), which characterizes foreground pixels based on their "virtual classes" rather than just saliency masks. A virtual class can be viewed as the representation of some unknown object in the training data. Our method employs K-means clustering to find the pseudo virtual class label for every foreground pixel at the start of each training epoch. These pseudo-labels are then used to guide the learning of pixel representations. Additionally, to avoid the overconfidence of pseudo-label prediction, RVCC incorporates an additional regularization term that encourages consistency between the predictions under weak and strong augmentations. Our experiments demonstrate that RVCC outperforms existing baselines on the Pascal VOC2012 and MSRCv2 datasets, showcasing its capability for the UIS problem.

AB Localization is a core problem in mobile robot navigation. Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) costs much for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This research aims to design an orthogonal laser scan device for localization and to save computation costs. Based on disturbance analysis, residual influences on sensor state are quantitative, and they are related to uncertainty and sensitivity. This research applied the residual selection method to a UAV. The feature point detection utilises multi-scale and Gaussian model fitting techniques to guarantee true positives. The map is represented by Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with lower memory costs. The orthogonal laser scan device is composed and placed on a UAV for real-time three-dimensional localization, whose errors are at the centimeter level.

AB We report on an original formalization of measure and integration theory in the Coq proof assistant. We build the Lebesgue measure following a standard construction that had not yet been formalized in proof assistants based on dependent type theory: by extension of a measure over a semiring of sets. We achieve this formalization by leveraging on existing techniques from the Mathematical Components project. We explain how we extend Mathematical Components' iterated operators and mathematical structures for analysis to provide support for infinite sums and extended real numbers. We introduce new mathematical structures for measure theory and incidentally provide an illustrative, concrete application of Hierarchy-Builder, a generic tool for the formalization of hierarchies of mathematical structures. This formalization of measure theory provides the basis for a new formalization of the Lebesgue integration compatible with the Mathematical Components project.

AB The image super-resolution reconstruction methods based on deep learning achieve satisfactory visual quality; however, the majority are difficult to be directly deployed to mobile or embedded devices due to the model complexity. This paper introduces a lightweight residual shuffle attention network for image super-resolution task. Among them, a residual shuffle attention block (RSAB) that fully integrates the information distillation mechanism is designed to extract deep features, which consists of multiple enhanced residual blocks (MERB) and shuffle attention. The MERB is capable of boosting the feature representation, and the shuffle attention can capture critical information extracted by grouping features. Furthermore, the RSAB utilizes multiple skip connection to build the module structure. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that the network model proposed in this paper outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks with acceptable complexity.

AB Effective detection of road objects in diverse environmental conditions is a critical requirement for autonomous driving systems. Multi-modal sensor fusion is a promising approach for improving perception, as it enables the combination of information from multiple sensor streams in order to optimize the integration of their respective data. Fusion operators are employed within fully convolutional architectures to combine features derived from different modalities. In this research, we present a framework that utilizes early fusion mechanisms to train and evaluate 2D object detection algorithms. Our evaluation shows that sensor fusion outperforms RGB-only detection methods, yielding a boost of +15.07% for car detection, +10.81% for pedestrian detection, and +19.86% for cyclist detection. In our comparative study, we evaluated three arithmetic-based fusion operators and two learnable fusion operators. Furthermore, we conducted a performance comparison between early- and mid-level fusion techniques and investigated the effects of early fusion on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity of our proposed framework, along with an ablation study.

LA English
DT Article
DE Pedestrian detection; Adjacent features; Dilated convolution; Multiple
   scale features; Attention mechanism
AB In recent years, despite the significant performance improvement for pedestrian detection algorithms in crowded scenes, an imbalance between detection accuracy and speed still exists. To address this issue, we propose an adjacent features complementary network for crowded pedestrian detection based on one-stage anchor-free detector, which is called AFC-Net. Firstly, deep dilated convolution (DDC) is invoked in the backbone to expand receptive fields, so that the feature map can remain its original size with feature spatial sensitivity enhanced. Secondly, hierarchical feature extraction (HFE) is designed to extract feature information pertinently according to the feature properties from different layers. Specifically, multi-scale feature extractor and channel attention mechanism are employed to extract contextual information among features on high-level features. Spatial attention mechanism is applied to filter background information on low-level features. Finally, adjacent feature integration (AFI) is proposed to aggregate the correlative features of adjacent layers so as to make expressive ability of features more comprehensive, thus improving the pedestrian detection results. In the challenging CityPersons dataset and CrowdHuman dataset, the crowded scene pedestrian detection network with complementary adjacent features has achieved great results in pedestrian detection. The result achieved from the experiment shows that the proposed algorithm can still maintain the comparability and stability of detection accuracy, while the network parameters are greatly reduced and the speed is effectively improved.

DE Incomplete multi-view clustering; Graph clustering; Subspace learning;
   Missing views
AB There is a large volume of incomplete multi-view data in the real-world. How to partition these incomplete multi-view data is an urgent realistic problem since almost all of the conventional multi-view clustering methods are inapplicable to cases with missing views. In this paper, a novel graph learning-based incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) method is proposed to address this issue. Different from existing works, our method aims at learning a common consensus graph from all incomplete views and obtaining a clustering indicator matrix in a unified framework. To achieve a stable clustering result, a relaxed spectral clustering model is introduced to obtain a probability consensus representation with all positive elements that reflect the data clustering result. Considering the different contributions of views to the clustering task, a weighted multi-view learning mechanism is introduced to automatically balance the effects of different views in model optimization. In this way, the intrinsic information of the incomplete multi-view data can be fully exploited. The experiments on several incomplete multi-view datasets show that our method outperforms the compared state-of-the-art clustering methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for IMVC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recently, Transformer-based models are taken much focus on solving the task of image super-resolution (SR) due to their ability to achieve better performance. However, these models combined huge computational cost during the computing self-attention mechanism. To solve this problem, we proposed a multi-order gated aggregation super-resolution network (MogaSRN) for low-level vision based on the concept of the MogaNet that is developed for high-level vision. The concept of the MogaSRN model is based on spatial multi-order context aggregation and adaptive channel-wise reallocation with the aid of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). In contrast to the MogaNet model, in which the resolution of each stage decreased by a factor of 2, the resolution of the MogaSRN is stayed fixed during the deep features extraction. Moreover, the structure of the MogaSRN model is built based on balancing the performance and the model complexity. We evaluated our model based on five benchmark datasets concluding that the MogaSRN model can achieve significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our model shows the good visual quality and accuracy of the reconstruction. Finally, our model has 3.7 x faster runtime at the scale of x 4 compared to LWSwinIR with better performance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although convolutional neural network (CNN) paradigms have expanded to transfer learning and ensemble models from original individual CNN architectures, few studies have focused on the performance comparison of the applicability of these techniques in detecting and localizing rice diseases. Moreover, most CNN-based rice disease detection studies only considered a small number of diseases in their experiments. Both these short-comings were addressed in this study. In this study, a rice disease classification comparison of six CNN-based deep-learning architectures (DenseNet121, Inceptionv3, MobileNetV2, resNext101, Resnet152V, and Seresnext101) was conducted using a database of nine of the most epidemic rice diseases in Bangladesh. In ad-dition, we applied a transfer learning approach to DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, Resnet152V, Seresnext101, and an ensemble model called DEX (Densenet121, EfficientNetB7, and Xception) to compare the six individual CNN net-works, transfer learning, and ensemble techniques. The results suggest that the ensemble framework provides the best accuracy of 98%, and transfer learning can increase the accuracy by 17% from the results obtained by Seresnext101 in detecting and localizing rice leaf diseases. The high accuracy in detecting and categorisation rice leaf diseases using CNN suggests that the deep CNN model is promising in the plant disease detection domain and can significantly impact the detection of diseases in real-time agricultural systems. This research is significant for farmers in rice-growing countries, as like many other plant diseases, rice diseases require timely and early identification of infected diseases and this research develops a rice leaf detection system based on CNN that is ex-pected to help farmers to make fast decisions to protect their agricultural yields and quality. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The emerging field of Citizen Relationship Management has shown promise to combine data analytics and intuitive digital platforms to help public managers interpret citizen-driven data and draw out appropriate policy. However, research dates back to only the last ten years, and does not commonly focus on families of extreme social vulnerability or how to bring solutions that increase access to public infrastructure. This research addresses the central challenge of setting strategic intervention plans for these families considering their multiple levels of vulnerability and the limited government resources available to address them. The paper builds on the framework for analytical CZRM to prototype and build a tool that analyzes data about income, nutrition, and housing for over 34,000 low-income families in Cear & PRIME;a, Brazil. Each family is assigned a vulnerability score, which is then used to filter public policy recommendations that address specific vulnerability profiles. The CZRM derives from over one year of interaction with government stakeholders who expressed their needs. Further software validation was completed with a series of test cases which ensured the tool was working and showing accurate results. The interactive mapping, ranking and filtering tool exemplifies an emerging decision support system to build a citizen portfolio and to set strategies to provide public services to different citizen groups.

AB Managing an extreme event like a healthcare disaster requires accurate information about the event's circumstances to comprehend the full consequences of acting. However, information quality is rarely optimal since it takes time to determine the information of relevance. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that even official data sources are far from optimal since they suffer from reporting delays that slow decision-making. To support decision-makers with timely information, we utilize data from online social networks to propose an adaptable information extraction solution to create indices helping to forecast COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates. We show that combining heterogeneous data sources like Twitter and Reddit can leverage these sources' inherent complementarity and yield better predictions than those using a single data source alone. We further show that the predictions run ahead of the official COVID-19 incidences by up to 14 days. Additionally, we highlight the importance of model adjustments whenever new information becomes available or the underlying data changes by observing distinct changes in the presence of specific symptoms on Reddit.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Current datasets for computer vision-based action recognition and localization cover a wide range of classes and challenging scenarios. However, these datasets don't cater to healthcare applications that involve long-term monitoring, tracking minor changes in movements over time for healthcare purposes, or completely modeling a specific human behavior that includes multiple sub-actions. Specifically, there are no existing datasets for research on either health monitoring on atomic-action-based eating behavior or for a full range of eating subactions that fully segment the main action. Addressing these gaps is valuable for extending research on the health monitoring of elderly people and is needed for creating richer and more complete descriptions of actions. This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset named EatSense that targets both the computer vision and healthcare communities and fills in the aforementioned gaps. EatSense is recorded while a person eats in an uncontrolled dining setting. The key features of EatSense are the introduction of challenging atomic actions for action recognition, the significantly diverse durations of actions that make it difficult for current temporal action localization frameworks to localize, the capability to model comprehensive eating behavior in terms of a sequence of action-based behaviors, and the simulation of minor variations in motion or performance. We conduct extensive experiments on EatSense with baseline deep learning-based approaches for benchmarking and hand-crafted feature-based approaches for explainable applications. We believe this dataset will benefit future researchers in building robust temporal action localization networks, behavior recognition, and performance assessment models for eating.

DE Multi-instance learning; Deconfounded; Embedding leaning; Classification
AB Confounded information is an objective fact when using multi-instance learning (MIL) to classify bags of instances, which may be inherited by MIL embedding methods and lead to questionable bag label prediction. To respond to this problem, we propose the multi-instance embedding learning with deconfounded instance-level prediction algorithm. Unlike traditional embedding-based strategies, we design a deconfounded optimization goal to maximize the distinction between instances in positive and negative bags. In addition, we present and use bag-level embedding with feature distillation to reduce the MIL classification task to a single-instance learning problem. Under the theoretical analysis, the embedding cohesiveness and feature magnitude metrics are developed to explain the benefits of the proposed deconfounded technique in MIL settings. Extensive experiments on thirty-four data sets demonstrate that our proposed method has the best overall performance over other state-of-the-art MIL methods. This strategy, in particular, has a substantial advantage on web data sets. Source codes are available at https://github.com/InkiInki/MEDI.

ID COMMUNITY DETECTION
AB The stochastic block model (SBM) is widely studied as a benchmark for graph clustering aka community detection. In practice, graph data often come with node attributes that bear additional information about the communities. Previous works modeled such data by considering that the node attributes are generated from the node community memberships. In this work, motivated by a recent surge of works in signal processing using deep neural networks as priors, we propose to model the communities as being determined by the node attributes rather than the opposite. We define the corresponding model; we call it the neural-prior SBM. We propose an algorithm, stemming from statistical physics, based on a combination of belief propagation and approximate message passing. We analyze the performance of the algorithm as well as the Bayes-optimal performance. We identify detectability and exact recovery phase transitions, as well as an algorithmically hard region. The proposed model and algorithm can be used as a benchmark for both theory and algorithms. To illustrate this, we compare the optimal performances to the performance of simple graph neural networks.

DE robust; monotonic; real-time processing
AB The Lipschitz constant of the map between the input and output space represented by a neural network is a natural metric for assessing the robustness of the model. We present a new method to constrain the Lipschitz constant of dense deep learning models that can also be generalized to other architectures. The method relies on a simple weight normalization scheme during training that ensures the Lipschitz constant of every layer is below an upper limit specified by the analyst. A simple monotonic residual connection can then be used to make the model monotonic in any subset of its inputs, which is useful in scenarios where domain knowledge dictates such dependence. Examples can be found in algorithmic fairness requirements or, as presented here, in the classification of the decays of subatomic particles produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Our normalization is minimally constraining and allows the underlying architecture to maintain higher expressiveness compared to other techniques which aim to either control the Lipschitz constant of the model or ensure its monotonicity. We show how the algorithm was used to train a powerful, robust, and interpretable discriminator for heavy-flavor-quark decays, which has been adopted for use as the primary data-selection algorithm in the LHCb real-time data-processing system in the current LHC data-taking period known as Run 3. In addition, our algorithm has also achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks in medicine, finance, and other applications.

AB Automating polyps' detection and segmentation is very helpful in achieving early detection and potentially effective treatment of colon cancer. Because of the constant rise in processing power at a reasonable cost and the availability of training data, deep learning more than ever is becoming very powerful and increasingly wide-spread in many domains, including computer vision and medical image processing and segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel method for polyp image segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and utilizing multi-parallel U-Net encoder architecture. The proposed method uses multiple encoders that utilize pre-trained CNNs to enrich the extracted features. Skip connections from these parallel encoders are concate-nated and propagated to the decoder in partially and fully meshed fashions allowing for data from shallow to deeper layers in the network to be exchanged and vice versa. We trained and tested the method on five publicly available datasets: Kvasir, CVC-Clinic DB, CVC-Colon DB, CVC-T, and ETIS-Larib, which are well-known benchmark datasets for polyp image segmentation. We tested the performance of the method on these five datasets using multiple testing scenarios including the effect of using attention, vision transformers, and multiple decoders. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on two of the used benchmark datasets and ranked second on a third.

ID COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). However, there are several limitations of this structure for mass segmentation in mammograms, which may lead to incorrect segmentation results. Recently, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based methods introduce a new way to solve computer vision (CV) problems. In this paper we propose U-shaped Sparse-MLP (USMLP), which is a MLP-based segmentation model with U-shaped architecture. Our proposed method consists of CNN layers and sparse MLP (sMLP) blocks. Detailed experiments on two public datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining efficiency, compared with other benchmarks. We hope the investigation of new network architecture can be beneficial to mass segmentation tasks as well as CAD systems.

AB Quantum neural network (QNN) is one of the promising directions where the near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices could find advantageous applications against classical resources. Recurrent neural networks are the most fundamental networks for sequential learning, but up to now there is still a lack of canonical model of quantum recurrent neural network (QRNN), which certainly restricts the research in the field of quantum deep learning. In the present work, we propose a new kind of QRNN which would be a good candidate as the canonical QRNN model, where, the quantum recurrent blocks (QRBs) are constructed in the hardware-efficient way, and the QRNN is built by stacking the QRBs in a staggered way that can greatly reduce the algorithm's requirement with regard to the coherent time of quantum devices. That is, our QRNN is much more accessible on NISQ devices. Furthermore, the performance of the present QRNN model is verified concretely using three different kinds of classical sequential data, i.e., meteorological indicators, stock price, and text categorization. The numerical experiments show that our QRNN achieves much better performance in prediction (classification) accuracy against the classical RNN and state-of-the-art QNN models for sequential learning, and can predict the changing details of temporal sequence data. The practical circuit structure and superior performance indicate that the present QRNN is a promising learning model to find quantum advantageous applications in the near term.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ACCURATE
AB In recent years, deep learning super-resolution models for progressive reconstruction have achieved great success. However, these models which refer to multi-resolution analysis basically ignore the information contained in the lower subspaces and do not explore the correlation between features in the wavelet and spatial domain, resulting in not fully utilizing the auxiliary information brought by multi-resolution analysis with multiple domains. Therefore, we propose a super-resolution network based on the wavelet multi-resolution framework (WMRSR) to capture the auxiliary information contained in multiple subspaces and to be aware of the interdependencies between spatial domain and wavelet domain features. Initially, the wavelet multi-resolution input (WMRI) is generated by combining wavelet sub-bands obtained from each subspace through wavelet multi-resolution analysis and the corresponding spatial domain image content, which serves as input to the network. Then, the WMRSR captures the corresponding features from the WMRI in the wavelet domain and spatial domain, respectively, and fuses them adaptively, thus learning fully explored features in multi-resolution and multi-domain. Finally, the high-resolution images are gradually reconstructed in the wavelet multi-resolution framework by our convolution-based wavelet transform module which is suitable for deep neural networks. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective and visual qualities.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Machine learning has significantly impacted the analysis of biological images and is now an important part of many biological data analysis pipelines. A variety of biological and biomedical domain-related tasks is gaining benefit from image analysis and pattern recognition tools developed currently. Applications include diagnostic histopathology, environmental monitoring, synthetic biology, genomics, and proteomics. Particularly in the last decade, several deep learning and advanced computer vision methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), typically trained in a supervised fashion, have started to be largely employed in biological image classification. Moreover, the advancement of automatic acquisition systems has been generating a massive amount of biological data, which requires to be analyzed by domain experts. However, the cost of manual annotation of such data has become a bottleneck, impairing the application of supervised machine learning algorithms. Biological images generally have an intrinsic high variability, whose identity is sometimes hard to assign and strongly dependent on the annotator's expertise. In this context, a limited number of annotation-free (i.e., unsupervised) learning solutions have been proposed, typically based on hand-crafted features, specifically tailored for a certain biological domain. Nonetheless, a successful unsupervised learning approach must be accurate, and sufficiently robust to deal with different biological domains. This paper aims at providing a viable solution to these issues, proposing an unsupervised learning algorithm based on compressed deep features for image classification. We exploit features extracted from ImageNet pre-trained transformers and CNNs, further compressed with a customized & beta;-Variational AutoEncoder (& beta;-VAE), that we call reconstruction VAE (R-VAE). We test our algorithm on biological images coming from diverse domains characterized by high variability in shape and texture information and acquired with widely differing imaging platforms. Considered image datasets range from multi-cellular organisms (plankton, coral) to sub-cellular organelles (budding yeast vacuoles, human cells' nuclei, etc.). Our results show that the compressed deep features extracted from different pre-trained vision models establish new unsupervised learning state-of-the-art performances for the investigated datasets.

AB Deep generative learning cannot only be used for generating new data with statistical characteristics derived from input data but also for anomaly detection, by separating nominal and anomalous instances based on their reconstruction quality. In this paper, we explore the performance of three unsupervised deep generative models-variational autoencoders (VAEs) with Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Boltzmann priors-in detecting anomalies in multivariate time series of commercial-flight operations. We created two VAE models with discrete latent variables (DVAEs), one with a factorized Bernoulli prior and one with a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) with novel positive-phase architecture as prior, because of the demand for discrete-variable models in machine-learning applications and because the integration of quantum devices based on two-level quantum systems requires such models. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that applies DVAE models to anomaly-detection tasks in the aerospace field. The DVAE with RBM prior, using a relatively simple-and classically or quantum-mechanically enhanceable-sampling technique for the evolution of the RBM's negative phase, performed better in detecting anomalies than the Bernoulli DVAE and on par with the Gaussian model, which has a continuous latent space. The transfer of a model to an unseen dataset with the same anomaly but without re-tuning of hyperparameters or re-training noticeably impaired anomaly-detection performance, but performance could be improved by post-training on the new dataset. The RBM model was robust to change of anomaly type and phase of flight during which the anomaly occurred. Our studies demonstrate the competitiveness of a discrete deep generative model with its Gaussian counterpart on anomaly-detection problems. Moreover, the DVAE model with RBM prior can be easily integrated with quantum sampling by outsourcing its generative process to measurements of quantum states obtained from a quantum annealer or gate-model device.

AB We consider a variational approach to the problem of structure + texture decomposition (also known as cartoon + texture decomposition). As usual for many variational problems in image analysis and processing, the energy we minimize consists of two terms: a data-fitting term and a regularization term. The main feature of our approach consists of choosing parameters in the regularization term adaptively. Namely, the regularization term is given by a weighted p(.)-Dirichlet-based energy ? a(x)|?u|( p(x)), where the weight and exponent functions are determined from an analysis of the spectral content of the image curvature. Our numerical experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, suggest that the proposed approach delivers better results than state-of-the-art methods for extracting the structure from textured and mosaic images, as well as competitive results on image enhancement problems.

The ZSL has been widely used in many knowledge-based models and applications to predict various parameters, including categories, subjects, and anomalies, in different domains. Nonetheless, most existing ZSL methods require the pre-defined semantics or attributes of particular data environments. Therefore, these methods are difficult to be applied to general data environments, such as ImageNet and other real-world datasets and applications. Recent research has tried to use open knowledge to enhance the ZSL methods to adapt it to an open data environment. However, the performance of these methods is relatively low, namely the accuracy is normally below 10%, which is due to the inadequate semantics that can be used from open knowledge. Moreover, the latest methods suffer from a significant "semantic gap" problem between the generated features of unseen classes and the real features of seen classes. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-view graph representation with a similarity diffusion model, applying the ZSL tasks to general data environments. This model applies a multi-view graph to enhance the semantics fully and proposes an innovative diffusion method to augment the graph representation. In addition, a feature diffusion method is proposed to augment the multi-view graph representation and bridge the semantic gap to realize zero-shot predicting. The results of numerous experiments in general data environments and on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art results in the field of general zero-shot learning. Furthermore, seven ablation studies analyze the effects of the settings and different modules of the proposed method on its performance in detail and prove the effectiveness of each module.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB This paper proposes a three-stage online deep learning model for time series based on the ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL). The edRVFL stacks multiple randomized layers to enhance the single-layer RVFL's representation ability. Each hidden layer's representation is utilized for training an output layer, and the ensemble of all output layers forms the edRVFL's output. However, the original edRVFL is not designed for online learning, and the randomized nature of the features is harmful to extracting meaningful temporal features. In order to address the limitations and extend the edRVFL to an online learning mode, this paper proposes a dynamic edRVFL consisting of three online components, the online decomposition, the online training, and the online dynamic ensemble. First, an online decomposition is utilized as a feature engineering block for the edRVFL. Then, an online learning algorithm is designed to learn the edRVFL. Finally, an online dynamic ensemble method, which can measure the change in the distribution, is proposed for aggregating all layers' outputs. This paper evaluates and compares the proposed model with state-of-the-art methods on sixteen time series. & COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   representation learning; Hypergraph structure learning
AB Spatiotemporal activity prediction aims to predict user activities at a particular time and location, which is applicable in city planning, activity recommendations, and other domains. The fundamental endeavor in spatiotemporal activity prediction is to model the intricate interaction patterns among users, locations, time, and activities, which is characterized by higher-order relations and hetero-geneity. Recently, graph-based methods have gained popularity due to the advancements in graph neural networks. However, these methods encounter two significant challenges. Firstly, higher-order relations and heterogeneity are not adequately modeled. Secondly, the majority of established methods are designed around the static graph structures that rely solely on co-occurrence relations, which can be imprecise. To overcome these challenges, we propose DyH2N, a dynamic heterogeneous hypergraph network for spatiotemporal activity prediction. Specifically, to enhance the capacity for modeling higher-order relations, hypergraphs are employed in lieu of graphs. Then we propose a set representation learning-inspired heterogeneous hyperedge learning module, which models higher -order relations and heterogeneity in spatiotemporal activity prediction using a non-decomposable manner. To improve the encoding of heterogeneous spatiotemporal activity hyperedges, a knowledge representation-regularized loss is introduced. Moreover, we present a hypergraph structure learning module to update the hypergraph structures dynamically. Our proposed DyH2N model has been ex-tensively tested on four real-world datasets, proving to outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by 5.98% to 27.13%. The effectiveness of all framework components is demonstrated through ablation experiments. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral clustering has attracted intensive attention in multimedia applications due to its good performance on arbitrary shaped clusters and well-defined mathematical framework. However, most existing multi-view spectral clustering methods still have the following demerits: (1) They ignore useful complementary information embedded in indicator matrices of different views. (2) The conventional post-processing methods based on the relax and discrete strategy inevitably result in the sub-optimal discrete solution. To tackle the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a low-rank discrete multi-view spectral clustering model. Drawing inspiration from the fact that the difference between indicator matrices of different views provides useful complementary information for clustering, our model exploits the complementary information embedded in indicator matrices with tensor Schatten p-norm constraint. Further, we integrate low-rank tensor learning and discrete label recovering into a uniform framework, which avoids the uncertainty of the relaxed and discrete strategy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Owing to the progress of transformer-based networks, there have been significant improvements in the performance of vision models in recent years. However, there is further potential for improvement in positional embeddings that play a crucial role in distinguishing information across different positions. Based on the biological mechanisms of human visual pathways, we propose a positional embedding network that adaptively captures position information by modeling the dorsal pathway, which is responsible for spatial perception in human vision. Our proposed double-stream architecture leverages large zero-padding convolutions to learn local positional features and utilizes transformers to learn global features, effectively capturing the interaction between dorsal and ventral pathways. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we implemented experiments on various datasets, employing differentiated designs. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that the simple implementation significantly enhances image classification performance, and the observed trends demonstrate its biological plausibility.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has achieved a great success in speaker verification (SV). All recent works treat within-utterance speaker embeddings (SE) to be positive instances, encouraging them to be as close as possible. However, positive instances from the same utterance have similar channel and related semantic information, which are difficult to distinguish from the speaker features. Moreover, these positive instances can only provide limited variances in a certain speaker. To tackle the above problems, we propose to use nearest neighbor (NN) positive instances for training, which are selected from a dynamic queue. The NN positive instances can provide different channel and semantic information, increasing the variances in a certain speaker. Our proposed method are validated through comprehensive experiments on VoxCeleb and CNCeleb1 datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving both SSCL and fine-tuning results. Additionally, our SSCL model outperforms supervised training model in cross-dataset testing due to the use of massive unlabeled data.

AB While checking functional correctness for automated driving is often achieved through vast amounts of automated and manual field testing, automating specification verification is essential for developing and releasing fully self-driving vehicles. This paper presents an automatic bounded model checking approach for functional specifications over longitudinal vehicle controller implementations. The proposed method checks the actual embedded program, rather than an extracted abstract model. The specification is converted into a monitor that is interleaved with the execution of the program over a finite time horizon in closed-loop simulation. A decomposition is proposed to tackle the verification complexity. This allows verifying the program for whole parameter sets using a software model checker as opposed to testing only individual samples. The approach is capable of identifying functional flaws in several exemplary longitudinal controllers with variable complexity. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Usage-based insurance (UBI) adjusts premiums based on an individual policyholder's dynamic risk evaluation, incentivizing policyholders to maintain safe driving behavior in pursuit of a lower insurance premium. Although post-trip interventions can improve driving behavior significantly, most interventions do not provide risk mitigation strategies tailored to long-term driving behavior. This study proposes a novel approach for driving risk prevention in UBI services, providing risk analysis services and tailoring driving suggestions for policyholders. Advanced prediction models and model interpretation methods were adopted to assess and analyze personal driving risks, respectively. A multi-objective counterfactual model was developed to generate risk mitigation strategies for policyholders. The significance of driving behavior in risk mitigation and its actionability were assessed to provide realistic and actionable suggestions for policyholders. The case study, based on a real dataset from an insurance company in China, showed that the proposed approach can be directly embedded in the existing UBI service framework to provide personalized feedback and services to policyholders.

AB The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) offers immense potential as a source of support for clinical research. However, previous studies focused on extracting only a limited set of medical concepts to support information extraction in the cancer domain for the Spanish language. Building on the success of deep learning for processing natural language texts, this paper proposes a transformer-based approach to extract named entities from breast cancer clinical notes written in Spanish and compares several language models. To facilitate this approach, a schema for annotating clinical notes with breast cancer concepts is presented, and a corpus for breast cancer is developed. Results indicate that both BERT-based and RoBERTabased language models demonstrate competitive performance in clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER). Specifically, BETO and multilingual BERT achieve F-scores of 93.71% and 94.63%, respectively. Additionally, RoBERTa Biomedical attains an F-score of 95.01%, while RoBERTa BNE achieves an F-score of 94.54%. The findings suggest that transformers can feasibly extract information in the clinical domain in the Spanish language, with the use of models trained on biomedical texts contributing to enhanced results. The proposed approach takes advantage of transfer learning techniques by fine-tuning language models to automatically represent text features and avoiding the time-consuming feature engineering process.

AB Person re-identification aims to retrieve specific pedestrians from different cameras and scenes, in which extracting robust and discriminative features is crucial for this task. To explore the potential interactions among images and learn more robust representations, this paper proposes Transformer-based Feature Interactor(TFI) and improved Margin Self-punishment Softmax loss(MS-Softamx). The Transformer-based Feature Interactor consists of Group Channel Pyramid Attention(GCPA) and Neighbor Interaction Modeling(NIM). Firstly, the Group Channel Pyramid Attention module provides prior information for high-level semantics via low-level semantics. The attention information is gradually stacked from coarse to fine to obtain enhanced hierarchical multi-scale features. Then, Neighbor Interaction Modeling effectively model the input and similar neighbors to produce a more robust and discriminative image representation. To make TFI more focused on intra-class embedding learning, we also propose Margin Self-punishment Softmax guide deep network learning, which obtains a tighter custom classification boundary by pushing the inter-class threshold and minimizing the intraclass variance. The proposed method is verified on four datasets, and this achieves 92.8%/95.6% mAP/Rank-1 on Market1501, 86.1%/90.8% mAP/Rank-1 on DukeMTMC, 64.4%/ 81.2% mAP/Rank-1 on MSMT17, 79.7%/ 80.8% mAP/Rank-1 on CUHK03-detected and 81.8%/81.9% mAP/Rank-1 on CUHK03-labeled. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper focuses on the synchronization control problem for neural networks (NNs) subject to stochastic cyber-attacks. Firstly, an adaptive event-triggered scheme (AETS) is adopted to improve the utilization rate of network resources, and an output feedback controller is constructed for improving the performance of the system subject to the conventional deception attack and accumulated dynamic cyber-attack. Secondly, the synchronization problem of master-slave NNs is transformed into the stability analysis problem of the synchronization error system. Thirdly, by constructing a customized Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), the adaptive event-triggered output feedback controller is designed to ensure the synchronization error system is asymptotically stable with a given H & INFIN; performance index. Lastly, in the simulation part, two examples, including Chua's circuit, illustrate the feasibility and universality of the related technologies in this paper.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMAGE; MODEL
AB Recently stereo image deraining has attracted lots of attention due to its superiority of abundant information from cross views. Exploring interaction information across stereo views is the key to improving the performance of stereo image deraining. In this paper, we design a general coarse -to-fine deraining framework for stereo rain streak and raindrop removal, called CDINet, comprising a stereo rain removal subnet and a stereo detail recovery subnet to restore images progressively. Two types of interaction modules are devised to explore interaction information for rain removal and detail recovery, respectively. Specifically, a global context interaction module is proposed to learn long-range dependencies of stereo images and remove rain by utilizing stereo structural information. A local detail interaction module is designed to model local contextual correlation, which aims at restoring the detail information by using neighborhood information from cross views. Extensive experiments are conducted on the two datasets including a synthetic rain streak removal dataset (RainKITTI) and a real raindrop removal dataset (Stereo Waterdrop), which demonstrates that our method sets new state-of-the-art deraining performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative metrics with faster speed.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Aspect-based sentiment analysis; Block-level dependency syntax;
   Block-dependency syntax-guided; interactive attention; Adaptive

AB End-to-End aspect-based sentiment analysis (E2E-ABSA) aims to jointly extract aspect terms and identify their sentiment polarities. Although previous research has demonstrated that syntax knowledge can be beneficial for E2E-ABSA, standard syntax dependency parsing struggles to capture the block-level relation between aspect and opinion terms, which hinders the role of syntax in E2EABSA. To address this issue, this paper proposes a block-level dependency syntax parsing (BDEP) based model to enhance the performance of E2E-ABSA. BDEP is constructed by incorporating routine dependency syntax parsing and part-of-speech tagging, which enables the capture of block-level relations. Subsequently. the BDEP-guided interactive attention module (BDEP-IAM) is used to obtain the aspect-aware representation of each word. Finally the adaptive fusion module is leveraged to combine the semantic-syntactic representation to simultaneously extract the aspect term and identify aspect-orient sentiment polarity. The model is evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including Laptop14, Rest _ALL, Restaurant14, Restaurant15, and TWITTER, with F1 scores of 62.67%, 76.53%, 75.42%, 62.21%, and 58.03%, respectively. The results show that our model outperforms the other compared state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all datasets. Additionally, ablation experiments confirm the efficacy of BDEP and IAM in improving aspect-level sentiment analysis. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Robotic Grasping and sorting is acknowledged as the most fundamental and significant manipulation task in industry. An ultimate goal of a Vision guided Robotic grasping system is to precisely and efficiently sort maximum objects with minimum inference time of vision system. So far, applicable end-to-end perception and autonomously picking of hierarchically stacked objects has not been intensively reported in previous works. Especially, in the scenario of top-down parcel bin-picking where robots are required to perceive and pick up parcels from random stacks. In this work, we focus on this challenging task by putting forward a novel end-to-end parcel bin-picking model termed 3D-OAS. Our proposal combines a 3D overlapping-aware instance segmentation and directed graph to describe the hierarchical structure of stacked objects from a top-down angle and a graph-neural-network is introduced to solve the optimal sorting orders. The experiment was conducted via a set of Vision guided Delta-Parallel robotic grasping system with a top-down RGB-D camera. Experimental Results proved the feasibility of our proposal, it could hierarchically segment stacked objects and solve sorting sequence with minimum one shot. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) present a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11 % of older adults in the United States. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of patients with ADRD, >50 % of them are not diagnosed and unaware of their disease. To address this challenge, we developed ADscreen, an innovative speech-processing based ADRD screening algorithm for the protective identification of patients with ADRD. ADscreen consists of five major components: (i) noise reduction for reducing background noises from the audio-recorded patient speech, (ii) modeling the patient's ability in phonetic motor planning using acoustic parameters of the patient's voice, (iii) modeling the patient's ability in semantic and syntactic levels of language organization using linguistic parameters of the patient speech, (iv) extracting vocal and semantic psycholinguistic cues from the patient speech, and (v) building and evaluating the screening algorithm. To identify important speech parameters (features) associated with ADRD, we used the Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM), an effective feature selection method for high dimensional, small sample size datasets. Modeling the relationship between speech parameters and the outcome variable (presence/absence of ADRD) was conducted using three different machine learning (ML) architectures with the capability of joining informative acoustic and linguistic with contextual word embedding vectors obtained from the DistilBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We evaluated the performance of the ADscreen on an audio-recorded patients' speech (verbal description) for the Cookie-Theft picture description task, which is publicly available in the dementia databank. The joint fusion of acoustic and linguistic parameters with contextual word embedding vectors of DistilBERT achieved F1-score = 84.64 (standard deviation [std] = & PLUSMN;3.58) and AUC-ROC = 92.53 (std = & PLUSMN;3.34) for training dataset, and F1-score = 89.55 and AUC-ROC = 93.89 for the test dataset. In summary, ADscreen has a strong potential to be integrated with clinical workflow to address the need for an ADRD screening tool so that patients with cognitive impairment can receive appropriate and timely care.

ID MOBILITY MANAGEMENT; NETWORK SELECTION; ALLOCATION
AB In recent years, heterogeneous networks (HetNets) have drawn a lot of attention to connecting devices that will enable everything to become smart, efficient, and fast. These networks are made up of many cell types, including macro, micro, pico, and femto that are added to suit customer demand. HetNets requires sophisticated mobility management to handle a variety of inter-frequency technologies. Mobility man-agement needs to be adequately addressed to prevent service degradation caused by high rates of unnec-essary handover attempts (HOA), handover ping-pong (HOPP), handover failure (HOF), radio link failure (RLF) and HO delay involved, which necessitates the user to execute the handover (HO) process while moving from one place to another. A well-suited HO management technique is proposed to resolve the issues observed when the user moves. The purpose of this study is to ascertain how the handover control parameter (HCP) involves the functionality of the 5G network.

AB With the growing amount of chemical data stored digitally, it has become crucial to represent chemical compounds accurately and consistently. Harmonized representations facilitate the extraction of insightful information from datasets, and are advantageous for machine learning applications. To achieve consistent representations throughout datasets, one relies on molecule standardization, which is typically accomplished using rule-based algorithms that modify descriptions of functional groups. Here, we present the first deep-learning model for molecular standardization. We enable custom standardization schemes based solely on data, which, as additional benefit, support standardization options that are difficult to encode into rules. Our model achieves over 98%

ID BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; EFFICIENT
AB We present an improved version of the nested sampling algorithm nessai in which the core algorithm is modified to use importance weights. In the modified algorithm, samples are drawn from a mixture of normalising flows and the requirement for samples to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) according to the prior is relaxed. Furthermore, it allows for samples to be added in any order, independently of a likelihood constraint, and for the evidence to be updated with batches of samples. We call the modified algorithm i-nessai. We first validate i-nessai using analytic likelihoods with known Bayesian evidences and show that the evidence estimates are unbiased in up to 32 dimensions. We compare i-nessai to standard nessai for the analytic likelihoods and the Rosenbrock likelihood, the results show that i-nessai is consistent with nessai whilst producing more precise evidence estimates. We then test i-nessai on 64 simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole coalescence and show that it produces unbiased estimates of the parameters. We compare our results to those obtained using standard nessai and dynesty and find that i-nessai requires 2.68 and 13.3 times fewer likelihood evaluations to converge, respectively. We also test i-nessai of an 80 s simulated binary neutron star signal using a reduced-order-quadrature basis and find that, on average, it converges in 24 min, whilst only requiring 1.01 x 10(6) likelihood evaluations compared to 1.42 x 10(6) for nessai and 4.30 x 10(7) for dynesty. These results demonstrate that i-nessai is consistent with nessai and dynesty whilst also being more efficient.

AB Physiological studies have shown that a group of locust's lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) has a diversity of collision selectivity to approaching objects, relatively darker or brighter than their backgrounds in cluttered environments. Such diversity of collision selectivity can serve locusts to escape from attack by natural enemies, and migrate in swarm free of collision. For computational studies, endeavours have been made to realize the diverse selectivity which, however, is still one of the most challenging tasks especially in complex and dynamic real world scenarios. The existing models are mainly formulated as multi-layered neural networks with merely feed-forward information processing, and do not take into account the effect of re-entrant signals in feedback loop, which is an essential regulatory loop for motion perception, yet never been explored in looming perception. In this paper, we inaugurate feedback neural computation for constructing a new LGMD-based model, named F-LGMD to look into the efficacy upon implementing different collision selectivity. Accordingly, the proposed neural network model features both feed-forward processing and feedback loop. The feedback control propagates output signals of parallel ON/OFF channels back into their starting neurons, thus makes part of the feed-forward neural network, i.e. the ON/OFF channels and the feedback loop form an iterative cycle system. Moreover, the feedback control is instantaneous, which leads to the existence of a fixed point whereby the fixed point theorem is applied to rigorously derive valid range of feedback coefficients. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct systematic experiments covering synthetic and natural collision datasets, and also online robotic tests. The experimental results show that the F-LGMD, with a unified network, can fulfil the diverse collision selectivity revealed in physiology, which not only reduces considerably the handcrafted parameters compared to previous studies, but also offers a both efficient and robust scheme for collision perception through feedback neural computation.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Cardiovascular diseases account for 17 million deaths per year worldwide. Of these, 25% are categorized as sudden cardiac death, which can be related to ventricular tachycardia (VT). This type of arrhythmia can be caused by focal activation sources outside the sinus node. Catheter ablation of these foci is a curative treatment in order to inactivate the abnormal triggering activity. However, the localization procedure is usually timeconsuming and requires an invasive procedure in the catheter lab. To facilitate and expedite the treatment, we present two novel localization support techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that address these clinical needs. In contrast to existing methods, our approaches were designed to be independent of the patient-specific geometry and directly applicable to surface ECG signals, while also delivering a binary transmural position. Moreover, one of the method's outputs can be interpreted as several ranked solutions. The CNNs were trained on a dataset containing only simulated data and evaluated both on simulated test data and clinical data. On a novel large and open simulated dataset, the median test error was below 3 mm. The median localization error on the unseen clinical data ranged from 32 mm to 41 mm without optimizing the pre-processing and CNN to the clinical data. Interpreting the output of one of the approaches as ranked solutions, the best median error of the top-3 solutions decreased to 20 mm on the clinical data. The transmural position was correctly detected in up to 82% of all clinical cases. These results demonstrate a proof of principle to utilize CNNs to localize the activation source without the intrinsic need for patient-specific geometrical information. Furthermore, providing multiple solutions can assist physicians in identifying the true activation source amongst more than one possible location. With further optimization to clinical data, these methods have high potential to accelerate clinical interventions, replace certain steps within these procedures and consequently reduce procedural risk and improve VT patient outcomes.

AB Image editing and compositing have become ubiquitous in entertainment, from digital art to AR and VR experiences. To produce beautiful composites, the camera needs to be geometrically calibrated, which can be tedious and requires a physical calibration target. In place of the traditional multi-image calibration process, we propose to infer the camera calibration parameters such as pitch, roll, field of view, and lens distortion directly from a single image using a deep convolutional neural network. We train this network using automatically generated samples from a large-scale panorama dataset, yielding competitive accuracy in terms of standard l(2 )error. However, we argue that minimizing such standard error metrics might not be optimal for many applications. In this work, we investigate human sensitivity to inaccuracies in geometric camera calibration. To this end, we conduct a large-scale human perception study where we ask participants to judge the realism of 3D objects composited with correct and biased camera calibration parameters. Based on this study, we develop a new perceptual measure for camera calibration and demonstrate that our deep calibration network outperforms previous single-image based calibration methods both on standard metrics as well as on this novel perceptual measure. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our calibration network for several applications, including virtual object insertion, image retrieval, and compositing.

TI An Information-Theoretic Method to Automatic Shortcut Avoidance and
   Domain Generalization for Dense Prediction Tasks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Dense prediction tasks; domain generalization; optical flow; semantic
   segmentation; shortcut learning; stereo matching
AB Deep convolutional neural networks for dense prediction tasks are commonly optimized using synthetic data, as generating pixel-wise annotations for real-world data is laborious. However, the synthetically trained models do not generalize well to real-world environments. This poor "synthetic to real" (S2R) generalization we address through the lens of shortcut learning. We demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in deep convolutional networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artifacts (shortcut attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic Shortcut Avoidance (ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related information from being encoded into the feature representations. Specifically, our proposed method minimizes the sensitivity of latent features to input variations: to regularize the learning of robust and shortcut-invariant features in synthetically trained models. To avoid the prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we propose a practical yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. Our results show that the proposed method can effectively improve S2R generalization in multiple distinct dense prediction tasks, such as stereo matching, optical flow, and semantic segmentation. Importantly, the proposed method enhances the robustness of the synthetically trained networks and outperforms their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging out-of-domain applications.

DE Local features detection and description; consistent attention
   mechanism; context augmentation; lightweight local descriptors;
   knowledge distillation
AB Local features detection and description are widely used in many vision applications with high industrial and commercial demands. With large-scale applications, these tasks raise high expectations for both the accuracy and speed of local features. Most existing studies on local features learning focus on the local descriptions of individual keypoints, which neglect their relationships established from global spatial awareness. In this paper, we present AWDesc with a consistent attention mechanism (CoAM) that opens up the possibility for local descriptors to embrace image-level spatial awareness in both the training and matching stages. For local features detection, we adopt local features detection with feature pyramid to obtain more stable and accurate keypoints localization. For local features description, we provide two versions of AWDesc to cope with different accuracy and speed requirements. On the one hand, we introduce Context Augmentation to address the inherent locality of convolutional neural networks by injecting non-local context information, so that local descriptors can "look wider to describe better". Specifically, well-designed Adaptive Global Context Augmented Module (AGCA) and Diverse Surrounding Context Augmented Module (DSCA) are proposed to construct robust local descriptors with context information from global to surrounding. On the other hand, we design an extremely lightweight backbone network coupled with the proposed special knowledge distillation strategy to achieve the best trade-off in accuracy and speed. What is more, we perform thorough experiments on image matching, homography estimation, visual localization, and 3D reconstruction tasks, and the results demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art local descriptors.

TI Automatic Transformation Search Against Deep Leakage From Gradients

DE Auto augmentation; collaborative learning; privacy protection;
   reconstruction attack; transformation
AB Collaborative learning has gained great popularity due to its benefit of data privacy protection: participants can jointly train a Deep Learning model without sharing their training sets. However, recent works discovered that an adversary can fully recover the sensitive training samples from the shared gradients. Such reconstruction attacks pose severe threats to collaborative learning. Hence, effective mitigation solutions are urgently desired. In this paper, we systematically analyze existing reconstruction attacks and propose to leverage data augmentation to defeat these attacks: by preprocessing sensitive images with carefully-selected transformation policies, it becomes infeasible for the adversary to extract training samples from the corresponding gradients. We first design two new metrics to quantify the impacts of transformations on data privacy and model usability. With the two metrics, we design a novel search method to automatically discover qualified policies from a given data augmentation library. Our defense method can be further combined with existing collaborative training systems without modifying the training protocols. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system settings. Evaluation results demonstrate that the policies discovered by our method can defeat state-of-the-art reconstruction attacks in collaborative learning, with high efficiency and negligible impact on the model performance.

   point cloud segmentation
AB Despite the progress made by few-shot segmentation (FSS) in low-data regimes, the generalization capability of most previous works could be fragile when countering hard query samples with seen-class objects. This paper proposes a fresh and powerful scheme to tackle such an intractable bias problem, dubbed base and meta (BAM). Concretely, we apply an auxiliary branch (base learner) to the conventional FSS framework (meta learner) to explicitly identify base-class objects, i.e., the regions that do not need to be segmented. Then, the coarse results output by these two learners in parallel are adaptively integrated to derive accurate segmentation predictions. Considering the sensitivity of meta learner, we further introduce adjustment factors to estimate the scene differences between support and query image pairs from both style and appearance perspectives, so as to facilitate the model ensemble forecasting. The remarkable performance gains on standard benchmarks (PASCAL-5', COCO-20', and FSS-1000) manifest the effectiveness, and surprisingly, our versatile scheme sets new state-of-the-arts even with two plain learners. Further-more, in light of its unique nature, we also discuss several more practical but challenging extensions, including generalized FSS, 3D point cloud FSS, class-agnostic FSS, cross-domain FSS, weak-label FSS, and zero-shot segmentation.

   regression; human pose estimation; latent regression; numerical
   coordinate regression
ID PICTORIAL STRUCTURES
AB In human and hand pose estimation, heatmaps are a crucial intermediate representation for a body or hand keypoint. Two popular methods to decode the heatmap into a final joint coordinate are via an argmax, as done in heatmap detection, or via softmax and expectation, as done in integral regression. Integral regression is learnable end-to-end, but has lower accuracy than detection. This paper uncovers an induced bias from integral regression that results from combining the softmax and the expectation operation. This bias often forces the network to learn degenerately localized heatmaps, obscuring the keypoint's true underlying distribution and leads to lower accuracies. Training-wise, by investigating the gradients of integral regression, we show that the implicit guidance of integral regression to update the heatmap makes it slower to converge than detection. To counter the above two limitations, we propose Bias Compensated Integral Regression (BCIR), an integral regression-based framework that compensates for the bias. BCIR also incorporates a Gaussian prior loss to speed up training and improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results on both the human body and hand benchmarks show that BCIR is faster to train and more accurate than the original integral regression, making it competitive with state-of-the-art detection methods.

AB Neural network models of machine learning have shown promising prospects for visual tasks, such as facial emotion recognition (FER). However, the generalization of the model trained from a dataset with a few samples is limited. Unlike the machine, the human brain can effectively realize the required information from a few samples to complete the visual tasks. To learn the generalization ability of the brain, in this article, we propose a novel brain-machine coupled learning method for facial emotion recognition to let the neural network learn the visual knowledge of the machine and cognitive knowledge of the brain simultaneously. The proposed method utilizes visual images and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to couple training the models in the visual and cognitive domains. Each domain model consists of two types of interactive channels, common and private. Since the EEG signals can reflect brain activity, the cognitive process of the brain is decoded by a model following reverse engineering. Decoding the EEG signals induced by the facial emotion images, the common channel in the visual domain can approach the cognitive process in the cognitive domain. Moreover, the knowledge specific to each domain is found in each private channel using an adversarial strategy. After learning, without the participation of the EEG signals, only the concatenation of both channels in the visual domain is used to classify facial emotion images based on the visual knowledge of the machine and the cognitive knowledge learned from the brain. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can produce excellent performance on several public datasets. Further experiments show that the proposed method trained from the EEG signals has good generalization ability on new datasets and can be applied to other network models, illustrating the potential for practical applications.

   learning; positive plus negative samples
AB As a representative self-supervised method, contrastive learning has achieved great successes in unsupervised training of representations. It trains an encoder by distinguishing positive samples from negative ones given query anchors. These positive and negative samples play critical roles in defining the objective to learn the discriminative encoder, avoiding it from learning trivial features. While existing methods heuristically choose these samples, we present a principled method where both positive and negative samples are directly learnable end-to-end with the encoder. We show that the positive and negative samples can be cooperatively and adversarially learned by minimizing and maximizing the contrastive loss, respectively. This yields cooperative positives and adversarial negatives with respect to the encoder, which are updated to continuously track the learned representation of the query anchors over mini-batches. The proposed method achieves 71.3% and 75.3% in top-1 accuracy respectively over 200 and 800 epochs of pre-training ResNet-50 backbone on ImageNet1K without tricks such as multi-crop or stronger augmentations. With Multi-Crop, it can be further boosted into 75.7%. The source code and pre-trained model are released in https://github.com/maple-research-lab/caco.

In this work, we propose an effective and efficient continual learning framework using random theory, together with Bayes' rule, to equip a single model with the ability to learn streaming data. The core idea of our framework is to preserve the performance of old tasks by guiding output weights to stay in a region of low error while encountering new tasks. In contrast to the existing continual learning approaches, our main contributions concern (1) closed-formed solutions with detailed theoretical analysis; (2) training continual learners by one-pass observation of samples; (3) remarkable advantages in terms of easy implementation, efficient parameters, fast convergence, and strong task-order robustness. Comprehensive experiments under popular image classification benchmarks, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that our methods predominately outperform the extensive state-of-the-art methods on training speed while maintaining superior accuracy and the number of parameters, in the class incremental learning scenario.

AB Recent advances in transformer-based architectures have shown promise in several machine learning tasks. In the audio domain, such architectures have been successfully utilised in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). However, existing works have not evaluated the influence of model size and pre-training data on downstream performance, and have shown limited attention to generalisation, robustness, fairness, and efficiency. The present contribution conducts a thorough analysis of these aspects on several pre-trained variants of wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT that we fine-tuned on the dimensions arousal, dominance, and valence of MSP-Podcast, while additionally using IEMOCAP and MOSI to test cross-corpus generalisation. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the top performance for valence prediction without use of explicit linguistic information, with a concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of. 638 on MSP-Podcast. Our investigations reveal that transformer-based architectures are more robust compared to a CNN-based baseline and fair with respect to gender groups, but not towards individual speakers. Finally, we show that their success on valence is based on implicit linguistic information, which explains why they perform on-par with recent multimodal approaches that explicitly utilise textual information. To make our findings reproducible, we release the best performing model to the community.

   learning; mutual information maximization

AB Decoding human visual neural representations is a challenging task with great scientific significance in revealing vision-processing mechanisms and developing brain-like intelligent machines. Most existing methods are difficult to generalize to novel categories that have no corresponding neural data for training. The two main reasons are 1) the under-exploitation of the multimodal semantic knowledge underlying the neural data and 2) the small number of paired (stimuli-responses) training data. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a generic neural decoding method called BraVL that uses multimodal learning of brain-visual-linguistic features. We focus on modeling the relationships between brain, visual and linguistic features via multimodal deep generative models. Specifically, we leverage the mixture-of-product-of-experts formulation to infer a latent code that enables a coherent joint generation of all three modalities. To learn a more consistent joint representation and improve the data efficiency in the case of limited brain activity data, we exploit both intra- and inter-modality mutual information maximization regularization terms. In particular, our BraVL model can be trained under various semi-supervised scenarios to incorporate the visual and textual features obtained from the extra categories. Finally, we construct three trimodal matching datasets, and the extensive experiments lead to some interesting conclusions and cognitive insights: 1) decoding novel visual categories from human brain activity is practically possible with good accuracy; 2) decoding models using the combination of visual and linguistic features perform much better than those using either of them alone; 3) visual perception may be accompanied by linguistic influences to represent the semantics of visual stimuli.

AB Image reconstruction from partial observations has attracted increasing attention. Conventional image reconstruction methods with hand-crafted priors often fail to recover fine image details due to the poor representation capability of the hand-crafted priors. Deep learning methods attack this problem by directly learning mapping functions between the observations and the targeted images can achieve much better results. However, most powerful deep networks lack transparency and are nontrivial to design heuristically. This paper proposes a novel image reconstruction method based on the Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework using learned Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) prior. Unlike existing unfolding methods that only estimate the image means (i.e., the denoising prior) but neglected the variances, we propose characterizing images by the GSM models with learned means and variances through a deep network. Furthermore, to learn the long-range dependencies of images, we develop an enhanced variant based on the Swin Transformer for learning GSM models. All parameters of the MAP estimator and the deep network are jointly optimized through end-to-end training. Extensive simulation and real data experimental results on spectral compressive imaging and image super-resolution demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

ID DOMAIN ADAPTATION
AB Deep long-tailed learning, one of the most challenging problems in visual recognition, aims to train well-performing deep models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the last decade, deep learning has emerged as a powerful recognition model for learning high-quality image representations and has led to remarkable breakthroughs in generic visual recognition. However, long-tailed class imbalance, a common problem in practical visual recognition tasks, often limits the practicality of deep network based recognition models in real-world applications, since they can be easily biased towards dominant classes and perform poorly on tail classes. To address this problem, a large number of studies have been conducted in recent years, making promising progress in the field of deep long-tailed learning. Considering the rapid evolution of this field, this article aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent advances in deep long-tailed learning. To be specific, we group existing deep long-tailed learning studies into three main categories (i.e., class re-balancing, information augmentation and module improvement), and review these methods following this taxonomy in detail. Afterward, we empirically analyze several state-of-the-art methods by evaluating to what extent they address the issue of class imbalance via a newly proposed evaluation metric, i.e., relative accuracy. We conclude the survey by highlighting important applications of deep long-tailed learning and identifying several promising directions for future research.

DE Convolutional object detector; deformable part model; feature

AB Region-based object detection infers object regions for one or more categories in an image. Due to the recent advances in deep learning and region proposal methods, object detectors based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been flourishing and provided promising detection results. However, the accuracy of the convolutional object detectors can be degraded often due to the low feature discriminability caused by geometric variation or transformation of an object. In this article, we propose a deformable part region (DPR) learning in order to allow decomposed part regions to be deformable according to the geometric transformation of an object. Because the ground truth of the part models is not available in many cases, we design part model losses for the detection and segmentation, and learn the geometric parameters by minimizing an integral loss including those part losses. As a result, we can train our DPR network without extra supervision, and make multi-part models deformable according to object geometric variation. Moreover, we propose a novel feature aggregation tree (FAT) so as to learn more discriminative region of interest (RoI) features via bottom-up tree construction. The FAT can learn the stronger semantic features by aggregating part RoI features along the bottom-up pathways of the tree. We also present a spatial and channel attention mechanism for the aggregation between different node features. Based on the proposed DPR and FAT networks, we design a new cascade architecture that can refine detection tasks iteratively. Without bells and whistles, we achieve impressive detection and segmentation results on MSCOCO and PASCAL VOC datasets. Our Cascade D-PRD achieves the 57.9 box AP with the Swin-L backbone. We also provide an extensive ablation study to prove the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods for large-scale object detection.

DT Article
DE Depth estimation; 3D reconstruction; multi-view stereo; neural radiance

AB In this work, we present a new multi-view depth estimation method NerfingMVS that utilizes both conventional reconstruction and learning-based priors over the recently proposed neural radiance fields (NeRF). Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system first adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its MVS reconstruction from COLMAP. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. We further present NerfingMVS++, where a coarse-to-fine depth priors training strategy is proposed to directly utilize sparse SfM points and the uniform sampling is replaced by Gaussian sampling to boost the performance. Experiments show that our NerfingMVS and its extension NerfingMVS++ achieve state-of-the-art performances on indoor datasets ScanNet and NYU Depth V2. In addition, we show that the guided optimization scheme does not sacrifice the original synthesis capability of neural radiance fields, improving the rendering quality on both seen and novel views.

AB Denoising diffusion models represent a recent emerging topic in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable results in the area of generative modeling. A diffusion model is a deep generative model that is based on two stages, a forward diffusion stage and a reverse diffusion stage. In the forward diffusion stage, the input data is gradually perturbed over several steps by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse stage, a model is tasked at recovering the original input data by learning to gradually reverse the diffusion process, step by step. Diffusion models are widely appreciated for the quality and diversity of the generated samples, despite their known computational burdens, i.e., low speeds due to the high number of steps involved during sampling. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of articles on denoising diffusion models applied in vision, comprising both theoretical and practical contributions in the field. First, we identify and present three generic diffusion modeling frameworks, which are based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models, noise conditioned score networks, and stochastic differential equations. We further discuss the relations between diffusion models and other deep generative models, including variational auto-encoders, generative adversarial networks, energy-based models, autoregressive models and normalizing flows. Then, we introduce a multi-perspective categorization of diffusion models applied in computer vision. Finally, we illustrate the current limitations of diffusion models and envision some interesting directions for future research.

TI Dual Vision Transformer

DT Article
DE Image recognition; self-attention learning; vision transformer
AB Recent advances have presented several strategies to mitigate the computations of self-attention mechanism with high-resolution inputs. Many of these works consider decomposing the global self-attention procedure over image patches into regional and local feature extraction procedures that each incurs a smaller computational complexity. Despite good efficiency, these approaches seldom explore the holistic interactions among all patches, and are thus difficult to fully capture the global semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer architecture that elegantly exploits the global semantics for self-attention learning, namely Dual Vision Transformer (Dual-ViT). The new architecture incorporates a critical semantic pathway that can more efficiently compress token vectors into global semantics with reduced order of complexity. Such compressed global semantics then serve as useful prior information in learning finer local pixel level details, through another constructed pixel pathway. The semantic pathway and pixel pathway are integrated together and are jointly trained, spreading the enhanced self-attention information in parallel through both of the pathways. Dual-ViT is henceforth able to capitalize on global semantics to boost self-attention learning without compromising much computational complexity. We empirically demonstrate that Dual-ViT provides superior accuracy than SOTA Transformer architectures with comparable training complexity.

TI Dynamic Spatial Sparsification for Efficient Vision Transformers and

DT Article
DE Dynamic neural networks; efficient inference model; spatial
   sparsification; vision transformers
AB In this paper, we present a new approach for model acceleration by exploiting spatial sparsity in visual data. We observe that the final prediction in vision Transformers is only based on a subset of the most informative regions, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find that the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks. To handle structured feature maps, we formulate a generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and expressive slow paths to important locations, we can maintain the complete structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments on diverse modern architectures and different visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31% similar to 35% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision Transformers. By introducing asymmetric computation, a similar acceleration can be achieved on modern CNNs and Swin Transformers. Moreover, our method achieves promising results on more complex tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/raoyongming/DynamicViT.

TI Efficient Robustness Assessment via Adversarial Spatial-Temporal Focus

DE Adversarial examples; black-box attacks; reinforcement learning;
   spatial-temporal analysis; video recognition
AB Adversarial robustness assessment for video recognition models has raised concerns owing to their wide applications on safety-critical tasks. Compared with images, videos have much high dimension, which brings huge computational costs when generating adversarial videos. This is especially serious for the query-based black-box attacks where gradient estimation for the threat models is usually utilized, and high dimensions will lead to a large number of queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose to simultaneously eliminate the temporal and spatial redundancy within the video to achieve an effective and efficient gradient estimation on the reduced searching space, and thus query number could decrease. To implement this idea, we design the novel Adversarial spatial-temporal Focus (AstFocus) attack on videos, which performs attacks on the simultaneously focused key frames and key regions from the inter-frames and intra-frames in the video. AstFocus attack is based on the cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. One agent is responsible for selecting key frames, and another agent is responsible for selecting key regions. These two agents are jointly trained by the common rewards received from the black-box threat models to perform a cooperative prediction. By continuously querying, the reduced searching space composed of key frames and key regions is becoming precise, and the whole query number becomes less than that on the original video. Extensive experiments on four mainstream video recognition models and three widely used action recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed AstFocus attack outperforms the SOTA methods, which is prevenient in fooling rate, query number, time, and perturbation magnitude at the same time.

DE Action recognition; video classification; spatial gating; channel fusion
AB Convolutional Neural Networks are the de facto models for image recognition. However 3D CNNs, the straight forward extension of 2D CNNs for video recognition, have not achieved the same success on standard action recognition benchmarks. One of the main reasons for this reduced performance of 3D CNNs is the increased computational complexity requiring large scale annotated datasets to train them in scale. 3D kernel factorization approaches have been proposed to reduce the complexity of 3D CNNs. Existing kernel factorization approaches follow hand-designed and hard-wired techniques. In this paper we propose Gate-Shift-Fuse (GSF), a novel spatio-temporal feature extraction module which controls interactions in spatio-temporal decomposition and learns to adaptively route features through time and combine them in a data dependent manner. GSF leverages grouped spatial gating to decompose input tensor and channel weighting to fuse the decomposed tensors. GSF can be inserted into existing 2D CNNs to convert them into an efficient and high performing spatio-temporal feature extractor, with negligible parameter and compute overhead. We perform an extensive analysis of GSF using two popular 2D CNN families and achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance on five standard action recognition benchmarks.

AB In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end group collaborative learning network, termed GCoNet+, which can effectively and efficiently (250 fps) identify co-salient objects in natural scenes. The proposed GCoNet+ achieves the new state-of-the-art performance for co-salient object detection (CoSOD) through mining consensus representations based on the following two essential criteria: 1) intra-group compactness to better formulate the consistency among co-salient objects by capturing their inherent shared attributes using our novel group affinity module (GAM); 2) inter-group separability to effectively suppress the influence of noisy objects on the output by introducing our new group collaborating module (GCM) conditioning on the inconsistent consensus. To further improve the accuracy, we design a series of simple yet effective components as follows: i) a recurrent auxiliary classification module (RACM) promoting model learning at the semantic level; ii) a confidence enhancement module (CEM) assisting the model in improving the quality of the final predictions; and iii) a group-based symmetric triplet (GST) loss guiding the model to learn more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., CoCA, CoSOD3k, and CoSal2015, demonstrate that our GCoNet+ outperforms the existing 12 cutting-edge models.

ID IMPUTATION; CLASSIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; NETWORK; MICE
AB Random forests are considered one of the best out-of-the-box classification and regression algorithms due to their high level of predictive performance with relatively little tuning. Pairwise proximities can be computed from a trained random forest and measure the similarity between data points relative to the supervised task. Random forest proximities have been used in many applications including the identification of variable importance, data imputation, outlier detection, and data visualization. However, existing definitions of random forest proximities do not accurately reflect the data geometry learned by the random forest. In this paper, we introduce a novel definition of random forest proximities called Random Forest-Geometry- and Accuracy-Preserving proximities (RF-GAP). We prove that the proximity-weighted sum (regression) or majority vote (classification) using RF-GAP exactly matches the out-of-bag random forest prediction, thus capturing the data geometry learned by the random forest. We empirically show that this improved geometric representation outperforms traditional random forest proximities in tasks such as data imputation and provides outlier detection and visualization results consistent with the learned data geometry.

AB Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required. In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision Transformers with three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters, and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. Based on this basic design, we develop a series of isotropic models with a Transformer-style simple architecture and CNN-style hierarchical models with better performance. Isotropic GFNet models exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity trade-offs compared to recent vision Transformers and pure MLP models. Hierarchical GFNet models can inherit successful designs in CNNs and be easily scaled up with larger model sizes and more training data, showing strong performance on both image classification (e.g., 85.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1 k without any extra data or supervision, and 87.4% accuracy with ImageNet-21 k pre-training) and dense prediction tasks (e.g., 54.3 mIoU on ADE20 k val). Our results demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to Transformer-based models and CNNs in terms of efficiency, generalization ability and robustness.

AB Efficient image super-resolution (SR) has witnessed rapid progress thanks to novel lightweight architectures or model compression techniques (e.g., neural architecture search and knowledge distillation). Nevertheless, these methods consume considerable resources or/and neglect to squeeze out the network redundancy at a more fine-grained convolution filter level. Network pruning is a promising alternative to overcome these shortcomings. However, structured pruning is known to be tricky when applied to SR networks because the extensive residual blocks demand the pruned indices of different layers to be the same. Besides, the principled determination of proper layerwise sparsities remains challenging too. In this article, we present Global Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning (GASSL) to resolve these problems. GASSL has two major components: Hessian-Aided Regularization (HAIR) and Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning (ASSL). HAIR is a regularization-based sparsity auto-selection algorithm with Hessian considered implicitly. A proven proposition is introduced to justify its design. ASSL is for physically pruning SR networks. Particularly, a new penalty term Sparsity Structure Alignment (SSA) is proposed to align the pruned indices of different layers. With GASSL, we design two new efficient single image SR networks of different architecture genres, pushing the efficiency envelope of SR models one step forward. Extensive results demonstrate the merits of GASSL over other recent counterparts.

AB Tensor recovery is a fundamental problem in tensor research field. It generally requires to explore intrinsic prior structures underlying tensor data, and formulate them as certain forms of regularization terms for guiding a sound estimate of the restored tensor. Recent researches have made significant progress by adopting two insightful tensor priors, i.e., global low-rankness (L) and local smoothness (S), which are always encoded as a sum of two separate regularizers into recovery models. However, unlike the primary theoretical developments on low-rank tensor recovery, these joint "L+S" models have no theoretical exact-recovery guarantees yet, making the methods lack reliability in real practice. To this crucial issue, in this work, we build a unique regularizer termed as tensor correlated total variation (t-CTV), which essentially encodes both L and S priors of a tensor simultaneously. Especially, by equipping t-CTV into the recovery models, we can rigorously prove the exact recovery guarantees for two typical tensor recovery tasks, i.e., tensor completion and tensor robust principal component analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this should be the first exact-recovery results among all related "L+S" methods for tensor recovery. We further propose ADMM algorithms with fine convergence to solve the proposed models. Significant recovery accuracy improvements are observed in extensive experiments. Typically, our method achieves a workable performance when the missing rate is extremely large, e.g., 99.5%, for the color image inpainting task, while all its peers totally fail in such a challenging case.

ID CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES
AB Histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) play a crucial role in cancer diagnosis. It is of significant importance for pathologists to search for images sharing similar content with the query WSI, especially in the case-based diagnosis. While slide-level retrieval could be more intuitive and practical in clinical applications, most methods are designed for patch-level retrieval. A few recently unsupervised slide-level methods only focus on integrating patch features directly, without perceiving slide-level information, and thus severely limits the performance of WSI retrieval. To tackle the issue, we propose a High-Order Correlation-Guided Self-Supervised Hashing-Encoding Retrieval (HSHR) method. Specifically, we train an attention-based hash encoder with slide-level representation in a self-supervised manner, enabling it to generate more representative slide-level hash codes of cluster centers and assign weights for each. These optimized and weighted codes are leveraged to establish a similarity-based hypergraph, in which a hypergraph-guided retrieval module is adopted to explore high-order correlations in the multi-pairwise manifold to conduct WSI retrieval. Extensive experiments on multiple TCGA datasets with over 24,000 WSIs spanning 30 cancer subtypes demonstrate that HSHR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other unsupervised histology WSI retrieval methods.

AB The key point for an experienced craftsman to repair broken objects effectively is that he must know about them deeply. Similarly, we believe that a model can capture rich geometry information from a shape/scene and generate discriminative representations if it is able to find distorted parts of shapes/scenes and restore them. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel self-supervised 3D learning paradigm named learning by restoring broken shapes/scenes (collectively called 3D geometry). We first develop a destroy-method cluster, from which we sample methods to break some local parts of an object. Then the destroyed object and the normal object are both sent into a point cloud network to get representations, which are employed to segment points that belong to distorted parts and further reconstruct/restore them to normal. To perform better in these two associated pretext tasks, the model is constrained to capture useful object features, such as rich geometric and contextual information. The object representations learned by this self-supervised paradigm transfer well to different datasets and perform well on downstream classification, segmentation and detection tasks. Experimental results on shape datasets and scene datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods. We also show experimentally that pre-training with our framework significantly boosts the performance of supervised models.

AB Deep learning based fusion methods have been achieving promising performance in image fusion tasks. This is attributed to the network architecture that plays a very important role in the fusion process. However, in general, it is hard to specify a good fusion architecture, and consequently, the design of fusion networks is still a black art, rather than science. To address this problem, we formulate the fusion task mathematically, and establish a connection between its optimal solution and the network architecture that can implement it. This approach leads to a novel method proposed in the paper of constructing a lightweight fusion network. It avoids the time-consuming empirical network design by a trial-and-test strategy. In particular we adopt a learnable representation approach to the fusion task, in which the construction of the fusion network architecture is guided by the optimisation algorithm producing the learnable model. The low-rank representation (LRR) objective is the foundation of our learnable model. The matrix multiplications, which are at the heart of the solution are transformed into convolutional operations, and the iterative process of optimisation is replaced by a special feed-forward network. Based on this novel network architecture, an end-to-end lightweight fusion network is constructed to fuse infrared and visible light images. Its successful training is facilitated by a detail-to-semantic information loss function proposed to preserve the image details and to enhance the salient features of the source images. Our experiments show that the proposed fusion network exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets. Interestingly, our network requires a fewer training parameters than other existing methods.

Existing methods tend to use a universal model for all incomplete data, resulting in a suboptimal model for each missingness pattern. In this paper, we present a general model for learning with incomplete data. The proposed model can be appropriately adjusted with different missingness patterns, alleviating competitions between data. Our model is based on observable features only, so it does not incur errors from data imputation. We further introduce a low-rank constraint to promote the generalization ability of our model. Analysis of the generalization error justifies our idea theoretically. In additional, a subgradient method is proposed to optimize our model with a proven convergence rate. Experiments on different types of data show that our method compares favorably with typical imputation strategies and other state-of-the-art models for incomplete data. More importantly, our method can be seamlessly incorporated into the neural networks with the best results achieved. The source code is released at https://github.com/YS-GONG/missingness-patterns.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become effective learning techniques for many downstream network mining tasks including node and graph classification, link prediction, and network reconstruction. However, most GNN methods have been developed for homogeneous networks with only a single type of node and edge. In this work we present muxGNN, a multiplex graph neural network for heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we represent graphs as multiplex networks consisting of a set of relation layer graphs and a coupling graph that links node instantiations across multiple relations. We parameterize relation-specific representations of nodes and design a novel coupling attention mechanism that models the importance of multi-relational contexts for different types of nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs. We further develop two complementary coupling structures: node invariant coupling suitable for node- and graph-level tasks, and node equivariant coupling suitable for link-level tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world datasets for link prediction in both transductive and inductive contexts and graph classification demonstrate the superior performance of muxGNN over state-of-the-art heterogeneous GNNs. In addition, we show that muxGNN's coupling attention discovers interpretable connections between different relations in heterogeneous networks.

AB We present a deep reinforcement learning method of progressive view inpainting for colored semantic point cloud scene completion under volume guidance, achieving high-quality scene reconstruction from only a single RGB-D image with severe occlusion. Our approach is end-to-end, consisting of three modules: 3D scene volume reconstruction, 2D RGB-D and segmentation image inpainting, and multi-view selection for completion. Given a single RGB-D image, our method first predicts its semantic segmentation map and goes through the 3D volume branch to obtain a volumetric scene reconstruction as a guide to the next view inpainting step, which attempts to make up the missing information; the third step involves projecting the volume under the same view of the input, concatenating them to complete the current view RGB-D and segmentation map, and integrating all RGB-D and segmentation maps into the point cloud. Since the occluded areas are unavailable, we resort to a A3C network to glance around and pick the next best view for large hole completion progressively until a scene is adequately reconstructed while guaranteeing validity. All steps are learned jointly to achieve robust and consistent results. We perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations with extensive experiments on the 3D-FUTURE data, obtaining better results than state-of-the-arts.

ID DESIGN
AB Spectral images with rich spatial and spectral information have wide usage, however, traditional spectral imaging techniques undeniably take a long time to capture scenes. We consider the computational imaging problem of the snapshot spectral spectrometer, i.e., the Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (CASSI) system. For the sake of a fast and generalized reconstruction algorithm, we propose a prior image guidance-based snapshot compressive imaging method. Typically, the prior image denotes the RGB measurement captured by the additional uncoded panchromatic camera of the dual-camera CASSI system. We argue that the RGB image as a prior image can provide valuable semantic information. More importantly, we design the Prior Image Semantic Similarity (PIDS) regularization term to enhance the reconstructed spectral image fidelity. In particular, the PIDS is formulated as the difference between the total variation of the prior image and the recovered spectral image. Then, we solve the PIDS regularized reconstruction problem by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

DE Prioritized subnet sampling; resource-adaptive; supernet
AB A resource-adaptive supernet adjusts its subnets for inference to fit the dynamically available resources. In this paper, we propose prioritized subnet sampling to train a resource-adaptive supernet, termed PSS-Net. We maintain multiple subnet pools, each of which stores the information of substantial subnets with similar resource consumption. Considering a resource constraint, subnets conditioned on this resource constraint are sampled from a pre-defined subnet structure space and high-quality ones will be inserted into the corresponding subnet pool. Then, the sampling will gradually be prone to sampling subnets from the subnet pools. Moreover, the one with a better performance metric is assigned with higher priority to train our PSS-Net, if sampling is from a subnet pool. At the end of training, our PSS-Net retains the best subnet in each pool to entitle a fast switch of high-quality subnets for inference when the available resources vary. Experiments on ImageNet using MobileNet-V1/V2 and ResNet-50 show that our PSS-Net can well outperform state-of-the-art resource-adaptive supernets. Our project is publicly available at https://github.com/chenbong/PSS-Net.

TI PSLT: A Light-Weight Vision Transformer With Ladder Self-Attention and
   Progressive Shift

DT Article
DE Ladder self-Attention; light-weight vision transformer; multimedia
   information retrieval
AB Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown great potential for various visual tasks due to its ability to model long-range dependency. However, ViT requires a large amount of computing resource to compute the global self-attention. In this work, we propose a ladder self-attention block with multiple branches and a progressive shift mechanism to develop a light-weight transformer backbone that requires less computing resources (e.g., a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs), termed Progressive Shift Ladder Transformer (PSLT). First, the ladder self-attention block reduces the computational cost by modelling local self-attention in each branch. In the meanwhile, the progressive shift mechanism is proposed to enlarge the receptive field in the ladder self-attention block by modelling diverse local self-attention for each branch and interacting among these branches. Second, the input feature of the ladder self-attention block is split equally along the channel dimension for each branch, which considerably reduces the computational cost in the ladder self-attention block (with nearly 1/3 the amount of parameters and FLOPs), and the outputs of these branches are then collaborated by a pixel-adaptive fusion. Therefore, the ladder self-attention block with a relatively small number of parameters and FLOPs is capable of modelling long-range interactions. Based on the ladder self-attention block, PSLT performs well on several vision tasks, including image classification, objection detection and person re-identification. On the ImageNet-1 k dataset, PSLT achieves a top-1 accuracy of 79.9% with 9.2 M parameters and 1.9 G FLOPs, which is comparable to several existing models with more than 20 M parameters and 4 G FLOPs.

AB With the development of 3D matching technology, correspondence-based point cloud registration gains more attention. Unfortunately, 3D keypoint techniques inevitably produce a large number of outliers, i.e., outlier rate is often larger than 95%. Guaranteed outlier removal (GORE) Bustos and Chin has shown very good robustness to extreme outliers. However, the high computational cost (exponential in the worst case) largely limits its usages in practice. In this paper, we propose the first O(N-2) time GORE method, called quadratic-time GORE (QGORE), which preserves the globally optimal solution while largely increases the efficiency. QGORE leverages a simple but effective voting idea via geometric consistency for upper bound estimation, which achieves almost the same tightness as the one in GORE. We also present a one-point RANSAC by exploring "rotation correspondence" for lower bound estimation, which largely reduces the number of iterations of traditional 3-point RANSAC. Further, we propose a l(p)-like adaptive estimator for optimization. Extensive experiments show that QGORE achieves the same robustness and optimality as GORE while being 1 similar to 2 orders faster. The source code will be made publicly available.

AB Inference at-the-edge using embedded machine learning models is associated with challenging trade-offs between resource metrics, such as energy and memory footprint, and the performance metrics, such as computation time and accuracy. In this work, we go beyond the conventional Neural Network based approaches to explore Tsetlin Machine (TM), an emerging machine learning algorithm, that uses learning automata to create propositional logic for classification. We use algorithm-hardware co-design to propose a novel methodology for training and inference of TM. The methodology, called REDRESS, comprises independent TM training and inference techniques to reduce the memory footprint of the resulting automata to target low and ultra-low power applications. The array of Tsetlin Automata (TA) holds learned information in the binary form as bits: $\lbrace 0,1\rbrace${0,1}, called excludes and includes, respectively. REDRESS proposes a lossless TA compression method, called the include-encoding, that stores only the information associated with includes to achieve over 99% compression. This is enabled by a novel computationally minimal training procedure, called the Tsetlin Automata Re-profiling, to improve the accuracy and increase the sparsity of TA to reduce the number of includes, hence, the memory footprint. Finally, REDRESS includes an inherently bit-parallel inference algorithm that operates on the optimally trained TA in the compressed domain, that does not require decompression during runtime, to obtain high speedups when compared with the state-of-the-art Binary Neural Network (BNN) models. In this work, we demonstrate that using REDRESS approach, TM outperforms BNN models on all design metrics for five benchmark datasets viz. MNIST, CIFAR2, KWS6, Fashion-MNIST and Kuzushiji-MNIST. When implemented on an STM32F746G-DISCO microcontroller, REDRESS obtained speedups and energy savings ranging 5-5700x compared with different BNN models.

TI RelTR: Relation Transformer for Scene Graph Generation

DT Article
DE One-stage; scene graph generation; scene understanding; visual
   relationship detection
AB Different objects in the same scene are more or less related to each other, but only a limited number of these relationships are noteworthy. Inspired by Detection Transformer, which excels in object detection, we view scene graph generation as a set prediction problem. In this article, we propose an end-to-end scene graph generation model Relation Transformer (RelTR), which has an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder reasons about the visual feature context while the decoder infers a fixed-size set of triplets subject-predicate-object using different types of attention mechanisms with coupled subject and object queries. We design a set prediction loss performing the matching between the ground truth and predicted triplets for the end-to-end training. In contrast to most existing scene graph generation methods, RelTR is a one-stage method that predicts sparse scene graphs directly only using visual appearance without combining entities and labeling all possible predicates. Extensive experiments on the Visual Genome, Open Images V6, and VRD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and fast inference of our model.

TI Representing Multimodal Behaviors With Mean Location for Pedestrian
   Trajectory Prediction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Pedestrian trajectory prediction; multimodal trajectory prediction;
   central-limit theorem
AB Representing multimodal behaviors is a critical challenge for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Previous methods commonly represent this multimodality with multiple latent variables repeatedly sampled from a latent space, encountering difficulties in interpretable trajectory prediction. Moreover, the latent space is usually built by encoding global interaction into future trajectory, which inevitably introduces superfluous interactions and thus leads to performance reduction. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Interpretable Multimodality Predictor (IMP) for pedestrian trajectory prediction, whose core is to represent a specific mode by its mean location. We model the distribution of mean location as a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) conditioned on sparse spatio-temporal features, and sample multiple mean locations from the decoupled components of GMM to encourage multimodality. Our IMP brings four-fold benefits: 1) Interpretable prediction to provide semantics about the motion behavior of a specific mode; 2) Friendly visualization to present multimodal behaviors; 3) Well theoretical feasibility to estimate the distribution of mean locations supported by the central-limit theorem; 4) Effective sparse spatio-temporal features to reduce superfluous interactions and model temporal continuity of interaction. Extensive experiments validate that our IMP not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods but also can achieve a controllable prediction by customizing the corresponding mean location.

DE Mapping; pose estimation; visual-LiDAR sensor system
ID SLAM; VERSATILE; ROBUST
AB Visual-LiDAR odometry and mapping (V-LOAM), which fuses complementary information of a camera and a LiDAR, is an attractive solution for accurate and robust pose estimation and mapping. However, existing systems could suffer nontrivial tracking errors arising from 1) association between 3D LiDAR points and sparse 2D features (i.e., 3D-2D depth association) and 2) obvious drifts in the vertical direction in the 6-degree of freedom (DOF) sweep-to-map optimization. In this paper, we present SDV-LOAM which incorporates a semi-direct visual odometry and an adaptive sweep-to-map LiDAR odometry to effectively avoid the above-mentioned errors and in turn achieve high tracking accuracy. The visual module of our SDV-LOAM directly extracts high-gradient pixels where 3D LiDAR points project on for tracking. To avoid the problem of large scale difference between matching frames in the VO, we design a novel point matching with propagation method to propagate points of a host frame to an intermediate keyframe which is closer to the current frame to reduce scale differences. To reduce the pose estimation drifts in the vertical direction, our LiDAR module employs an adaptive sweep-to-map optimization method which automatically choose to optimize 3 horizontal DOF or 6 full DOF pose according to the richness of geometric constraints in the vertical direction. In addition, we propose a novel sweep reconstruction method which can increase the input frequency of LiDAR point clouds to the same frequency as the camera images, and in turn yield a high frequency output of the LiDAR odometry in theory. Experimental results demonstrate that our SDV-LOAM ranks 8th on the KITTI odometry benchmark which outperforms most LiDAR/visual-LiDAR odometry systems. In addition, our visual module outperforms state-of-the-art visual odometry and our adaptive sweep-to-map optimization can improve the performance of several existing open-sourced LiDAR odometry systems. Moreover, we demonstrate our SDV-LOAM on a custom-built hardware platform in large-scale environments which achieves both a high accuracy and output frequency. We have released the source code of our SDV-LOAM for the development of the community.

ID RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK
AB Hand gesture serves as a crucial role during the expression of sign language. Current deep learning based methods for sign language understanding (SLU) are prone to over-fitting due to insufficient sign data resource and suffer limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose the first self-supervised pre-trainable SignBERT+ framework with model-aware hand prior incorporated. In our framework, the hand pose is regarded as a visual token, which is derived from an off-the-shelf detector. Each visual token is embedded with gesture state and spatial-temporal position encoding. To take full advantage of current sign data resource, we first perform self-supervised learning to model its statistics. To this end, we design multi-level masked modeling strategies (joint, frame and clip) to mimic common failure detection cases. Jointly with these masked modeling strategies, we incorporate model-aware hand prior to better capture hierarchical context over the sequence. After the pre-training, we carefully design simple yet effective prediction heads for downstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive experiments on three main SLU tasks, involving isolated and continuous sign language recognition (SLR), and sign language translation (SLT). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving new state-of-the-art performance with a notable gain.

TI Source-Free Progressive Graph Learning for Open-Set Domain Adaptation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Action recognition; domain adaptation; open-set domain adaptation;
   source-free domain adaptation
AB Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain while addressing disturbances from irrelevant target classes not present in the source data. However, most OSDA approaches are limited due to the lack of essential theoretical analysis of generalization bound, reliance on the coexistence of source and target data during adaptation, and failure to accurately estimate model predictions' uncertainty. To address these limitations, the Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework is proposed. PGL decomposes the target hypothesis space into shared and unknown subspaces and progressively pseudo-labels the most confident known samples from the target domain for hypothesis adaptation. PGL guarantees a tight upper bound of the target error by integrating a graph neural network with episodic training and leveraging adversarial learning to close the gap between the source and target distributions. The proposed approach also tackles a more realistic source-free open-set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA) setting that makes no assumptions about the coexistence of source and target domains. In a two-stage framework, the SF-PGL model' uniformly selects the most confident target instances from each category at a fixed ratio, and the confidence thresholds in each class weigh the classification loss in the adaptation step. The proposed methods are evaluated on benchmark image classification and action recognition datasets, where they demonstrate superiority and flexibility in recognizing both shared and unknown categories. Additionally, balanced pseudo-labeling plays a significant role in improving calibration, making the trained model less prone to over- or under-confident predictions on the target data.

AB Learning graphs represented by M-matrices via an l(1)-regularized Gaussian maximum-likelihood method is a popular approach, but also one that poses computational challenges for large scale datasets. Recently proposed methods cast this problem as a constrained optimization variant of precision matrix estimation. In this paper, we build on a state-of-the-art sparse precision matrix estimation method and introduce two algorithms that learn M-matrices, that can be subsequently used for the estimation of graph Laplacian matrices. In the first one, we propose an unconstrained method that follows a post processing approach in order to learn an M-matrix, and in the second one, we implement a constrained approach based on sequential quadratic programming. We also demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and performance of both algorithms. Our numerical examples and comparative results with modern open-source packages reveal that the proposed methods can accelerate the learning of graphs by up to 3 orders of magnitude, while accurately retrieving the latent graphical structure of the data. Furthermore, we conduct large scale case studies for the clustering of COVID-19 daily cases and the classification of image datasets to highlight the applicability in real-world scenarios.

AB Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision. Previous learning-based methods for LiDAR point cloud registration can be categorized into two schemes: dense-to-dense matching methods and sparse-to-sparse matching methods. However, for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds, solving dense point correspondences is time-consuming, whereas sparse keypoint matching easily suffers from keypoint detection error. In this paper, we propose SDMNet, a novel Sparse-to-Dense Matching Network for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud registration. Specifically, SDMNet performs registration in two sequential stages: sparse matching stage and local-dense matching stage. In the sparse matching stage, we sample a set of sparse points from the source point cloud and then match them to the dense target point cloud using a spatial consistency enhanced soft matching network and a robust outlier rejection module. Furthermore, a novel neighborhood matching module is developed to incorporate local neighborhood consensus, significantly improving performance. The local-dense matching stage is followed for fine-grained performance, where dense correspondences are efficiently obtained by performing point matching in local spatial neighborhoods of high-confidence sparse correspondences. Extensive experiments on three large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

TI Surrogate Modeling for Bayesian Optimization Beyond a Single Gaussian

   sampling; Bayesian regret analysis
AB Bayesian optimization (BO) has well-documented merits for optimizing black-box functions with an expensive evaluation cost. Such functions emerge in applications as diverse as hyperparameter tuning, drug discovery, and robotics. BO hinges on a Bayesian surrogate model to sequentially select query points so as to balance exploration with exploitation of the search space. Most existing works rely on a single Gaussian process (GP) based surrogate model, where the kernel function form is typically preselected using domain knowledge. To bypass such a design process, this paper leverages an ensemble (E) of GPs to adaptively select the surrogate model fit on-the-fly, yielding a GP mixture posterior with enhanced expressiveness for the sought function. Acquisition of the next evaluation input using this EGP-based function posterior is then enabled by Thompson sampling (TS) that requires no additional design parameters. To endow function sampling with scalability, random feature-based kernel approximation is leveraged per GP model. The novel EGP-TS readily accommodates parallel operation. To further establish convergence of the proposed EGP-TS to the global optimum, analysis is conducted based on the notion of Bayesian regret for both sequential and parallel settings. Tests on synthetic functions and real-world applications showcase the merits of the proposed method.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Scene understanding through pixel-level semantic parsing is one of the main problems in computer vision. Till now, image-based methods and datasets for scene parsing have been well explored. However, the real world is naturally dynamic instead of a static state. Thus, learning to perform video scene parsing is more practical for real-world applications. Considering that few datasets cover an extensive range of scenes and object categories with temporal pixel-level annotations, in this work, we present a large-scale video scene parsing dataset, namely VSPW (Video Scene Parsing in the Wild). To be specific, there are a total of 251,633 frames from 3,536 videos with densely pixel-wise annotations in VSPW, including a large variety of 231 scenes and 124 object categories. Besides, VSPW is densely annotated with a high frame rate of 15 f/s, and over 96% of videos from VSPW have high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4 K. To the best of our knowledge, VSPW is the first attempt to address the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenes. Based on our VSPW, we further propose Temporal Attention Blending (TAB) Networks to harness temporal context information for better pixel-level semantic understanding of videos. Extensive experiments on VSPW well demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TAB over other baseline approaches. We hope the new proposed dataset and the explorations in this work can help advance the challenging yet practical video scene parsing task in the future. Both the dataset and the code are available at www.vspwdataset.com.

ID TRACKING
AB For each partition of a data set into a given number of parts there is a partition such that every part is as much as possible a good model (an "algorithmic sufficient statistic") for the data in that part. Since this can be done for every number between one and the number of data, the result is a function, the cluster structure function. It maps the number of parts of a partition to values related to the deficiencies of being good models by the parts. Such a function starts with a value at least zero for no partition of the data set and descents to zero for the partition of the data set into singleton parts. The optimal clustering is the one selected by analyzing the cluster structure function. The theory behind the method is expressed in algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity). In practice the Kolmogorov complexities involved are approximated by a concrete compressor. We give examples using real data sets: the MNIST handwritten digits and the segmentation of real cells as used in stem cell research.

AB Point cloud data have been widely explored due to its superior accuracy and robustness under various adverse situations. Meanwhile, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved very impressive success in various applications such as surveillance and autonomous driving. The convergence of point cloud and DNNs has led to many deep point cloud models, largely trained under the supervision of large-scale and densely-labelled point cloud data. Unsupervised point cloud representation learning, which aims to learn general and useful point cloud representations from unlabelled point cloud data, has recently attracted increasing attention due to the constraint in large-scale point cloud labelling. This paper provides a comprehensive review of unsupervised point cloud representation learning using DNNs. It first describes the motivation, general pipelines as well as terminologies of the recent studies. Relevant background including widely adopted point cloud datasets and DNN architectures is then briefly presented. This is followed by an extensive discussion of existing unsupervised point cloud representation learning methods according to their technical approaches. We also quantitatively benchmark and discuss the reviewed methods over multiple widely adopted point cloud datasets. Finally, we share our humble opinion about several challenges and problems that could be pursued in the future research in unsupervised point cloud representation learning.

TI Variational Relational Point Completion Network for Robust 3D

DE 3D perception; multi-view partial point clouds; point cloud completion;
   self-attention operations
AB Real-scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to viewpoint, occlusion, and noise, which hampers 3D geometric modeling and perception. Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute multi-view partial point cloud datasets (MVP and MVP-40 dataset) containing over 200,000 high-quality scans, which render partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks. Notably, VRCNet shows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point cloud scans. Moreover, we can achieve robust 3D classification for partial point clouds with the help of VRCNet, which can highly increase classification accuracy.

TI Visual Reasoning: From State to Transformation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

AB Most existing visual reasoning tasks, such as CLEVR in VQA, ignore an important factor, i.e., transformation. They are solely defined to test how well machines understand concepts and relations within static settings, like one image. Such state driven visual reasoning has limitations in reflecting the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has shown to be equally important for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning (TVR) task. Given both the initial and final states, the target becomes to infer the corresponding intermediate transformation. Following this definition, a new synthetic dataset namely TRANCE is first constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e., Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Next, we build another real dataset called TRANCO based on COIN, to cover the loss of transformation diversity on TRANCE. Inspired by human reasoning, we propose a three-staged reasoning framework called TranNet, including observing, analyzing, and concluding, to test how recent advanced techniques perform on TVR. Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event, View, and TRANCO. We believe the proposed new paradigm will boost the development of machine visual reasoning. More advanced methods and new problems need to be investigated in this direction.

DT Article
DE Hough Transform; multidimensional data; hyperplane detection; parameter
   space
AB Line, plane and hyperplane detection in multidimensional data has many applications in computer vision and artificial intelligence. We propose Integrated Fast Hough Transform (IFHT), a highly-efficient multidimensional Hough transform algorithm based on a new mathematical model. The parameter space of IFHT can be represented with a single k-tree to support hierarchical storage and "coarse-to-fine" search strategy. IFHT essentially changes the least square data-fitting in Li's Fast Hough transform (FHT) to the total least squares data-fitting, in which observational errors across all dimensions are taken into account, thus more practical and more resistant to data noise. It has practically resolved the problem of decreased precision of FHT for target objects mapped to boundaries between accumulators in the parameter space. In addition, it enables a straightforward visualization of the parameter space which not only provides intuitive insight on the number of objects in the data, but also helps with tuning the parameters and combining multiple instances if needed. In all simulated data with different levels of noise and parameters, IFHT surpasses Li's Fast Hough transform in terms of robustness and precision significantly.

AB Dynamic neural networks can greatly reduce computation redundancy without compromising accuracy by adapting their structures based on the input. In this paper, we explore the robustness of dynamic neural networks against energy-oriented attacks targeted at reducing their efficiency. Specifically, we attack dynamic models with our novel algorithm GradMDM. GradMDM is a technique that adjusts the direction and the magnitude of the gradients to effectively find a small perturbation for each input, that will activate more computational units of dynamic models during inference. We evaluate GradMDM on multiple datasets and dynamic models, where it outperforms previous energy-oriented attack techniques, significantly increasing computation complexity while reducing the perceptibility of the perturbations https://github.com/lingengfoo/GradMDM.

AB The human ability to recognize when an object belongs or does not belong to a particular vision task outperforms all open set recognition algorithms. Human perception as measured by the methods and procedures of visual psychophysics from psychology provides an additional data stream for algorithms that need to manage novelty. For instance, measured reaction time from human subjects can offer insight as to whether a class sample is prone to be confused with a different class - known or novel. In this work, we designed and performed a large-scale behavioral experiment that collected over 200,000 human reaction time measurements associated with object recognition. The data collected indicated reaction time varies meaningfully across objects at the sample-level. We therefore designed a new psychophysical loss function that enforces consistency with human behavior in deep networks which exhibit variable reaction time for different images. As in biological vision, this approach allows us to achieve good open set recognition performance in regimes with limited labeled training data. Through experiments using data from ImageNet, significant improvement is observed when training Multi-Scale DenseNets with this new formulation: it significantly improved top-1 validation accuracy by 6.02%, top-1 test accuracy on known samples by 9.81%, and top-1 test accuracy on unknown samples by 33.18%. We compared our method to 10 open set recognition methods from the literature, which were all outperformed on multiple metrics.

   Salient object detection; Scattering wavelet network
AB In the salient object detection task, convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have been extensively used. However, preserving a variety of boundary features of objects is equally important while detecting the salient objects. Detecting salient objects with poor boundaries have a significant detrimental effect on the salient object detection (SOD) models' robustness and accuracy. The proposed method leverages a unique and novel edge-directed salient object detection network, which combines wavelet scattering network features with CNNbased features. This integration enables the network to capture both textural and high-level semantic information, leading to improved SOD performance. Additionally, a learnable wavelet scattering network allows for the efficient collection and preservation of textural aspects of objects. This network is seamlessly embedded into the encoder section of the proposed architecture, enhancing the discriminative power of the model. Furthermore, a weighted feature integration module (WFIM) is proposed in the decoder section to adaptively integrate linked nearby features by evaluating their relevance, resulting in improved representation and discrimination capabilities. Extensive testing on well-known benchmark SOD datasets demonstrates that the proposed LDWS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, exhibiting accurate identification of salient objects and efficient detection of their edges.

DE Visual tracking; Attention; Transformer; Siamese networks
AB For Siamese-based trackers in the field of single object tracking, cross-correlation operation plays an important role. However, the cross-correlation essentially uses target feature to locally linearly match the search region, which leads to insufficient utilization or even loss of feature information. To effectively employ global context and sufficiently explore the relevance of template and search region, a novel matching operator is designed inspired by Transformer, which uses multi-head attention and embed a designed modulation module across the inputs of operator. Meanwhile, we equip our tracker with a multi-scale encoder/decoder strategy to gradually make more precise tracking. Finally, a complete tracking framework is presented named VTTR. The tracker consists of a feature extractor, a multi-scale encoder based on depth-wise convolution, a modified decoder as the matching operator and a prediction head. The proposed tracker is tested on many benchmarks and achieve excellent performance while running with fast speed.

ID THORAX DISEASE CLASSIFICATION
AB Long-tailed classification with fine-grained appearance, e.g., in chest X-ray images, is very challenging due to the very similar appearance and imbalanced distribution between normal and abnormal samples, which extremely limits the ability of deep networks to learn powerful representations and discriminative classifiers. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Representation and Classifier Learning (JRCL) framework to achieve the above purposes, simultaneously. In terms of representation learning, we propose a One-to-All supervised contrastive learning strategy to avoid the medium or tail classes mixing in the head classes. For the classifier cleaning, we propose a novel Binary Distribution Consistency (BDC) loss to learn a discriminative classifier that could separate the normal and abnormal samples.The BDC loss measures the binary distribution consistency between the designed multi-class classifier and an auxiliary binary classifier. Consequently, the JRCL framework is optimized with a supervised contrastive learning loss, a binary distribution consistency loss, and a multi-classification loss. We conduct experiments on large-scale, long-tail image datasets, NIH-CXR-LT, MIMIC-CXR-LT, iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT. Experimental results demonstrate JRCL could improve the discriminate ability of the imbalanced data and thus obtain better classification performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our proposed JRCL achieves comparable or even better performance. The source codes are available at https://github. com/guanqj932/JRCL.

AB Dependency stochastic Boolean satisfiability (DSSAT), which generalizes stochastic Boolean satisfiability (SSAT) and dependency quantified Boolean formula (DQBF), is a new logical formalism that allows compact encoding of NEXPTIME decision problems under uncertainty. Despite potentially broad applications, a decision procedure for DSSAT remains lacking. In this work, we present the first sound and complete resolution calculus for DSSAT. The resolution system deduces the maximum satisfying probability of a DSSAT formula and provides a witnessing certificate. We also show that when the special case of SSAT formulas is considered, the DSSAT resolution calculus p-simulates a known SSAT resolution scheme. Our result may pave a theoretical foundation for further development and certification of DSSAT solvers.

AB We consider the simulation of Bayesian statistical inverse problems governed by large-scale linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are standard techniques to solve such problems. However, MCMC techniques are computationally challenging as they require a prohibitive number of forward PDE solves. The goal of this paper is to introduce a fractional deep neural network (fDNN) based approach for the forward solves within an MCMC routine. Moreover, we discuss some approximation error estimates. We illustrate the efficiency of fDNN on inverse problems governed by nonlinear elliptic PDEs and the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. In the former case, two examples are discussed, respectively depending on two and 100 parameters, with significant observed savings. The unsteady Navier-Stokes example illustrates that fDNN can outperform existing DNNs, doing a better job of capturing essential features such as vortex shedding.

AB The cactus is a plant that grows in many rural areas, widely used as a hedge, and has multiple benefits through the manufacture of various cosmetics and other products. However, this crop has been suffering for some time from the attack of the carmine scale Dactylopius opuntia (Hemiptera: Dactylopiidae). The infestation can spread rapidly if not treated in the early stage. Current solutions consist of regular field checks by the naked eyes carried out by experts. The major difficulty is the lack of experts to check all fields, especially in remote areas. In addition, this requires time and resources. Hence the need for a system that can categorize the health level of cacti remotely. To date, deep learning models used to categorize plant diseases from images have not addressed the mealy bug infestation of cacti because computer vision has not sufficiently addressed this disease. Since there is no public dataset and smartphones are commonly used as tools to take pictures, it might then be conceivable for farmers to use them to categorize the infection level of their crops. In this work, we developed a system called CactiVIT that instantly determines the health status of cacti using the Visual image Transformer (ViT) model. We also provided a new image dataset of cochineal infested cacti.1 Finally, we developed a mobile application that delivers the classification results directly to farmers about the infestation in their fields by showing the probabilities related to each class. This study compares the existing models on the new dataset and presents the results obtained. The VIT-B-16 model reveals an approved performance in the literature and in our experiments, in which it achieved 88.73% overall accuracy with an average of +2.61% compared to other convolutional neural network (CNN) models that we evaluated under similar conditions.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Cell type identification using single-cell RNA sequencing data is critical for understanding disease mechanisms and drug discovery. Cell clustering analysis has been widely studied in health research for rare tumor cell detection. In this study, we propose a Gaussian mixture model-based variational graph autoencoder on scRNA-seq data (scGMM-VGAE) that integrates a statistical clustering model to a deep learning algorithm to significantly improve the cell clustering performance. This model feeds a cell-cell graph adjacency matrix and a gene feature matrix into a graph variational autoencoder (VGAE) to generate latent data. These data are then used for cell clustering by the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) module. To optimize the algorithm, a designed loss function is derived by combining parameter estimates from the GMM and VGAE. We test the proposed method on four publicly available and three simulated datasets which contain many biological and technical zeros. The scGMM-VGAE outperforms four selected baseline methods on three evaluation metrics in cell clustering. By successfully incorporating GMM into deep learning VGAE on scRNA-seq data, the proposed method shows higher accuracy in cell clustering on scRNA-seq data. This improvement has a significant impact on detecting rare cell types in health research. All source codes used in this study can be found at .

AB In an intelligent transportation system, pedestrian identification is an indispensable security link. This paper aims to explore a high precision and real-time pedestrian recognition method. Most of the existing pedestrian recognition methods are usually pixel-level and framed. However, these methods cannot be able to make an accurate or real-time judgment of the pedestrian position. To this end, this paper introduces a novel contour-based segmentation network (PerSnake) for real-time pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. We design an octagon contour specifically for pedestrians by using a YOLO-V4 detector as the initial pedestrian contour, and a contour feature aggregation module is proposed to aggregate the multi-level pedestrian contour features. To construct pedestrian contour labels, we annotate the ground truth of the pedestrian contour on Penn-Fudan and Citypersons datasets by using edge detection. Substantial experiments are conducted on the CityPersons, and the Penn-Fudan database. The results demonstrate that our PerSnake is capable of achieving real-time pedestrian identification with a speed of 37.8 frame per second and the average precision reaches 36.4%. Compared with the existing methods, our PerSnake exhibits competitive advantages in terms of segmentation speed and precision.

AB Multi-modal depth estimation is one of the key challenges for endowing autonomous machines with robust robotic perception capabilities. There have been outstanding advances in the development of uni-modal depth estimation techniques based on either monocular cameras, because of their rich resolution, or LiDAR sensors, due to the precise geometric data they provide. However, each of these suffers from some inherent drawbacks, such as high sensitivity to changes in illumination conditions in the case of cameras and limited resolution for the LiDARs. Sensor fusion can be used to combine the merits and compensate for the downsides of these two kinds of sensors. Nevertheless, current fusion methods work at a high level. They process the sensor data streams independently and combine the high-level estimates obtained for each sensor. In this paper, we tackle the problem at a low level, fusing the raw sensor streams, thus obtaining depth estimates which are both dense and precise, and can be used as a unified multi-modal data source for higher-level estimation problems. This work proposes a conditional random field model with multiple geometry and appearance potentials. It seamlessly represents the problem of estimating dense depth maps from camera and LiDAR data. The model can be optimized efficiently using the conjugate gradient squared algorithm. The proposed method was evaluated and compared with the state of the art using the commonly used KITTI benchmark dataset.

AB The method of choice for integrating the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) in high-dimension is to generate samples from the solution via integration of the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE). Here, we study an alternative scheme based on integrating an ordinary differential equation that describes the flow of probability. Acting as a transport map, this equation deterministically pushes samples from the initial density onto samples from the solution at any later time. Unlike integration of the stochastic dynamics, the method has the advantage of giving direct access to quantities that are challenging to estimate from trajectories alone, such as the probability current, the density itself, and its entropy. The probability flow equation depends on the gradient of the logarithm of the solution (its 'score'), and so is a-priori unknown. To resolve this dependence, we model the score with a deep neural network that is learned on-the-fly by propagating a set of samples according to the instantaneous probability current. We show theoretically that the proposed approach controls the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the learned solution to the target, while learning on external samples from the SDE does not control either direction of the KL divergence. Empirically, we consider several high-dimensional FPEs from the physics of interacting particle systems. We find that the method accurately matches analytical solutions when they are available as well as moments computed via Monte-Carlo when they are not. Moreover, the method offers compelling predictions for the global entropy production rate that out-perform those obtained from learning on stochastic trajectories, and can effectively capture non-equilibrium steady-state probability currents over long time intervals.

DE transformer; SE3 transformer; drug design; field points; similarity;

AB Due to their computational efficiency, 2D fingerprints are typically used in similarity-based high-content screening. The interaction of a ligand with its target protein, however, relies on its physicochemical interactions in 3D space. Thus, ligands with different 2D scaffolds can bind to the same protein if these ligands share similar interaction patterns. Molecular fields can represent those interaction profiles. For efficiency, the extrema of those molecular fields, named field points, are used to quantify the ligand similarity in 3D. The calculation of field points involves the evaluation of the interaction energy between the ligand and a small probe shifted on a fine grid representing the molecular surface. These calculations are computationally prohibitive for large datasets of ligands, making field point representations of molecules intractable for high-content screening. Here, we overcome this roadblock by one-shot prediction of field points using generative neural networks based on the molecular structure alone. Field points are predicted by training an SE(3)-Transformer, an equivariant, attention-based graph neural network architecture, on a large set of ligands with field point data. Resulting data demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to precisely generate negative, positive and hydrophobic field points within 0.5 & ANGS; of the ground truth for a diverse set of drug-like molecules.

AB An emergency risk assessment by collecting disaster-affected images via unmanned aerial vehicles is the current norm. Reasonable rescue planning and resource allocation depend on a quick and precise semantic interpretation of natural disaster images. However, the poor image quality produced by various technological and environmental factors and complex scenarios associated with disaster-affected regions makes the classification operation challenging. In order to get in-depth spatial features for decoding the intricate textures associated with catastrophe images, this study proposes an implementation of the CNN-based multibranch feature extraction technique. An advanced mixed-attention mechanism is exploited to extract the highly essential features. This mixed-attention mechanism effectively overcomes the flaws generated by traditional convolution by neglecting the global information and focusing on local key features. An SRGAN-based super-resolution method is utilized to acquire high-resolution images with rich spatial details to enhance the quality of aerial images. Besides, we experiment with several existing image classification algorithms, such as the ensemble model of pre-trained networks, the capsule network model, and the stacked autoencoder. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis between all the deployed models to obtain the best-performing classifier. Our proposed multibranch feature extraction with mixed-attention mechanism-based network performs more superiorly among the four models due to its ability to extract highly relevant features from disaster images. Generated super-resolution images effectively increase the classification performance. Our research findings and approaches accommodate quality resources for disaster image quality enhancement and classification activities.

AB In many practical applications like autonomous driving and robot navigation, the large-scale 3D point cloud segmentation method is required to be both fast and efficient. In this paper, a fast and efficient large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation network, namely FFA-Net, is proposed. We used U-Net architecture as the backbone architecture, and used the random sampling algorithm to down sample the 3D points faster. To maintain the speed advantage of random sampling and protect integral information of 3D point cloud, we designed a lightweight operator, called fast feature aggregation (FFA) operator, to learn local features of 3D point cloud efficiently, and we equipped this FFA operator in a dilated residual block to aggregate local features within a larger receptive field hierarchically. This operator contains only minimal of learnable parameters, which makes the segmentation network not only improved in segmentation performance, but also in computation speed. Extensive experimental results on three large-scale 3D point cloud benchmarks have verified the effectiveness of our method in both segmentation performances and speed.

ID OBJECT TRACKING
AB In this study, we concentrate on solving variations in scale, aspect ratio, rotation, visual model and target motion problems for vehicle tracking in low-altitude UAV videos. The contributions of this work are threefold: 1. By introducing a particle rescaling mechanism where each particle is resized with different aspect ratios, tracking under scale and aspect ratio variations is improved. 2. By fully integrating a particle filter with a convolutional neural network, a new structure, which acts as an auxiliary particle filter, is developed. This new structure improves the estimation of the states, namely the location and the velocity of the target, and the dimensions of the bounding boxes, thus enables tracking under fast motion. 3. By introducing a unified multi-part vehicle tracking framework, robust tracking is achieved against scale change, aspect ratio, visual model variations and sudden rotations. The processing of multiple parts, independently, improves the tracking under sudden aspect ratio and rotation changes compared to tracking the vehicle as a whole. In this study, without loss of generality, the number of independent parts is taken as two and the proposed method is tested for image sequences from UAV dataset with various visual problems. The comparisons with the state-of-the-art trackers show that the proposed method achieves good precision and success scores, and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art trackers.

DE Intelligent transportation; Traffic sign recognition; Mask RCNN; Low
   illumination; Illumination image enhancement
AB To address the problems such as the difficulty of traffic sign detection and recognition under low illumination, a new low illumination traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm is proposed. The algorithm firstly uses an illumination judgement algorithm to filter out low-illumination images, then uses a New Illumination Enhancement algorithm to adjust the brightness and contrast of the low-illumination images, and finally uses mask RCNN (mask region-based convolutional neural network, mask RCNN) to detect and recognize traffic signs. The New Illumination Enhancement Algorithm is based on Illumination-Reflection model, firstly converting the image RGB space into HSV space, applying guided filtering to the V channel to obtain the illumination component, using the illumination component to extract the reflection component, and adjusting the reflection component by linear pull-up. Next, the distribution characteristics of the illumination component are used to adjust the 2D gamma function and obtain the optimized illumination component. Subsequently, the illumination component is used to obtain the detail component. Finally, a hybrid spatial enhancement method is used to obtain the enhanced V-channel and reconstruct the image. The experimental results show that the New Illumination Enhancement algorithm can effectively improve image brightness and sharpness in both low illumination traffic scenes, ensure that the image is not distorted, retain image information and enhance the prominence of traffic signs in traffic scenes. In the ZCTSDB-lightness test set, the combined algorithm of new light image enhancement and Mask RCNN improved object detection mAP(bb) and instance segmentation mAP(seg) by 2.810% and 1.176%, respectively, compared to Mask RCNN. In the ZCTSDB test set, the performance of the new low illumination traffic sign detection and recognition algorithm outperformed all other algorithms.

AB In recent years, many-objective optimization problems have been widely used. however, with the increase of the number of objectives, the difficulty of solving increases exponentially, and the imbalance between convergence and diversity becomes more serious. In view of the above problems, this paper combines the idea of three-way decision, redesigns the environment selection strategy, and proposes a many-objective optimization algorithm based on three-way decision. Firstly, the distance from the individual to the ideal point is used as an index to measure individual convergence, the minimum distance from the individual to other solutions is used as an indicator to measure individual diversity, and the individuals with good convergence and good diversity are selected separately by combining the thresholds of the three-way decision; and secondly, A dynamic threshold acquisition method is designed to further improve the performance of the algorithm; Finally, it is proved that the algorithm can effectively balance convergence and diversity through tests of different data sets, so as to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm & COPY; 2023 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Faculty of Computers and Information, Cairo University.

AB Developing behavioral policies designed to efficiently solve target-search problems is a crucial issue both in nature and in the nanotechnology of the 21st century. Here, we characterize the target-search strategies of simple microswimmers in a homogeneous environment containing sparse targets of unknown positions. The microswimmers are capable of controlling their dynamics by switching between Brownian motion and an active Brownian particle and by selecting the time duration of each of the two phases. The specific conduct of a single microswimmer depends on an internal decision-making process determined by a simple neural network associated with the agent itself. Starting from a population of individuals with random behavior, we exploit the genetic algorithm NeuroEvolution of augmenting topologies to show how an evolutionary pressure based on the target-search performances of single individuals helps to find the optimal duration of the two different phases. Our findings reveal that the optimal policy strongly depends on the magnitude of the particle's self-propulsion during the active phase and that a broad spectrum of network topology solutions exists, differing in the number of connections and hidden nodes.

AB Pathological diagnosis is the gold standard for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The manual segmentation of pathology sections is time-consuming. Automatic segmentation has become a clinical requirement. Recently, the UNet network has been widely used in automatic segmentation; however, due to the complex structure and diverse shapes of pathological slices of cholangiocarcinoma, the segmentation ability of UNet is insufficient. In addition, traditional RGB images cannot reflect the spectral characteristics of cancerous tissue. Therefore, in this paper, a high-level feature channel attention UNet (HLCA-UNet) network is proposed to segment cholangiocarcinoma using microscopy hyperspectral images. Compared with the original UNet, HLCA-UNet has the following improvements: (1) a new path consisting of hierarchical feature extraction and channel attention mechanism designed to deliver encoder features to decoder, in which the hierarchical feature extraction module is able to extract high-resolution high-level features and reduce semantic gaps while channel attention mechanism establishes a deep correlation between the low-level and high-level features, (2) we introduce bilinear interpolation technology to replace the transpose convolution so as to achieve a smooth segmentation boundary. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed HLCA-UNet model and compared it with other excellent models using cholangiocarcinoma microscopy hyperspectral images. Experiment results show that HLCA-UNet gains a superior performance, with accuracy, precision, and recall of 82.84%, 69.60%, and 77.99%, respectively. In general, our study provides new ideas for future pathological diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and makes recommendations for future researchers.

AB Sign language is the predominant form of communication among a large group of society. The nature of sign languages is visual. This makes them very different from spoken languages. Unfortunately, very few able people can understand sign language making communication with the hearing-impaired extremely difficult. Research in the field of sign language recognition can help reduce the barrier between deaf and able people. A lot of work has been done on sign language recognition for numerous languages such as American sign language and Chinese sign language. Unfortunately, very little to no work has been done for Pakistan Sign Language. Any contribution in Pakistan Sign Language recognition is limited to static images instead of gestures. Furthermore, the dataset available for this language is very small in terms of the number of examples per word which makes it very difficult to train deep networks that require a considerable amount of training data. Data Augmentation techniques help the network generalize better by providing more variety in the training data. In this paper, a pipeline for the Pakistan Sign Language recognition system is proposed that incorporates an augmentation unit. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, three deep learning models, C3D, I3D, and TSM are used. Results show that translation and rotation are the two best augmentation techniques for the Pakistan Sign Language dataset. The models trained using our data-augment-supported pipeline outperform other methods that only used the original data. The most suitable model is C3D which not only produced an accuracy of 93.33% but also has a low training time as compared to other models.

AB The face data in the wild have a face occlusion, complex background, and inestimable posture, leading to more sample classification errors. To alleviate the problem of face occlusion, we apply facial information reconstruction to occluded face recognition. Our model processes face images with variable poses and reconstructs face information to compensate for information loss due to occlusion. In this context, we propose an unconstrained face recognition method based on information reconstruction and occlusion dictionary learning. One is that 3D facial information reconstruction makes up for the lost part of self-occluded face images. The other is that the Gabor-based occlusion dictionary learning method increases feature diversity and better represents occluded faces. We conduct experiments on the occluded AR dataset to verify the robustness of occluded dictionary learning. Compared with the classical algorithm, the accuracy of the CAS-PEAL dataset improves by 40.3%. The experimental results of the LFW dataset are 5.57-12.21% higher than those of the state-of-the-art algorithm, which indicates that the proposed method realizes effective occlusion face recognition.

AB As the basis work of image processing, rain removal from a single image has always been an important and challenging problem. Due to the lack of real rain images and corresponding clean images, most rain removal networks are trained by synthetic datasets, which makes the output images unsatisfactory in practical applications. In this work, we propose a new feature decoupling network for unsupervised image rain removal. Its purpose is to decompose the rain image into two distinguishable layers: clean image layer and rain layer. In order to fully decouple the features of different attributes, we use contrastive learning to constrain this process. Specifically, the image patch with similarity is pulled together as a positive sample, while the rain layer patch is pushed away as a negative sample. We not only make use of the inherent self-similarity within the sample, but also make use of the mutual exclusion between the two layers, so as to better distinguish the rain layer from the clean image. We implicitly constrain the embedding of different samples in the depth feature space to better promote rainline removal and image restoration. Our method achieves a PSNR of 25.80 on Test100, surpassing other unsupervised methods.

AB A set of words X is not primitivity-preserving if there is a primitive list of length at least two of elements from X whose concatenation is imprimitive. Here, a word or list is primitive if it is not equal to a concatenation of several copies of a shorter word or list, and imprimitive otherwise. We formalize a full characterization of such two-element sets {x, y} in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. The formalization is based on an existing proof which we analyze and simplify using some innovative ideas. Part of the formalization, interesting on its own, is a description of the ways in which the square xx can appear inside a concatenation of words x and y if |y| = |x|. We also provide a formalized parametric solution of the related equation x(j)y(k) = z(l).

AB We introduce renaming-enriched sets (rensets for short), which are algebraic structures axiomatizing fundamental properties of renaming (also known as variable-for-variable substitution) on syntax with bindings. Rensets compare favorably in some respects with the well-known foundation based on nominal sets. In particular, renaming is a more fundamental operator than the nominal swapping operator and enjoys a simpler, equationally expressed relationship with the variable-freshness predicate. Together with some natural axiomsmatching properties of the syntactic constructors, rensets yield a trulyminimalistic characterization of.-calculus terms as an abstract datatype-one involving an infinite set of unconditional equations, referring only to the most fundamental term operators: the constructors and renaming. This characterization yields a recursion principle, which (similarly to the case of nominal sets) can be improved by incorporating Barendregt's variable convention. When interpreting syntax in semantic domains, our renaming-based recursor is easier to deploy than the nominal recursor. Our results have been validated with the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.

AB Constrained combinatorial optimization problems abound in industry, from portfolio optimization to logistics. One of the major roadblocks in solving these problems is the presence of non-trivial hard constraints which limit the valid search space. In some heuristic solvers, these are typically addressed by introducing certain Lagrange multipliers in the cost function, by relaxing them in some way, or worse yet, by generating many samples and only keeping valid ones, which leads to very expensive and inefficient searches. In this work, we encode arbitrary integer-valued equality constraints of the form Ax(sic)= b(sic), directly into U(1) symmetric tensor networks (TNs) and leverage their applicability as quantum-inspired generative models to assist in the search of solutions to combinatorial optimization problems within the generator-enhanced optimization framework of Alcazar et al (2021 arXiv:2101.06250). This allows us to exploit the generalization capabilities of TN generative models while constraining them so that they only output valid samples. Our constrained TN generative model efficiently captures the constraints by reducing number of parameters and computational costs. We find that at tasks with constraints given by arbitrary equalities, symmetric matrix product states outperform their standard unconstrained counterparts at finding novel and better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems.

ID INFERENCE
AB Causal discovery from observational data offers unique opportunities in many scientific disciplines: reconstructing causal drivers, testing causal hypotheses, and comparing and evaluating models for optimizing targeted interventions. Recent causal discovery methods focused on estimating the latent space of the data to get around a lack of causal sufficiency or additivity constraints. However, estimating the latent space significantly increases model complexity, compromising causal identifiability and making it hard to compare models that correspond to different causal hypotheses. We propose a kernel, non-parametric latent-space modelling approach and deal with the difficulty of comparing causal directions by measuring and controlling for the level of causal assumption fulfilment. We introduce a latent noise causal inference framework to estimate latent factors associated with the hypothesized causal direction by optimizing a loss function with kernel independence criteria. We extend the framework to work with time series using an additional time-dependent kernel regularizer. We discuss the additivity assumption and model complexity and give empirical evidence of performance in a wide range of synthetic and real causal discovery problems.

AB Despite the successes of machine learning methods in physical sciences, the prediction of the Hamiltonian, and thus the electronic properties, is still unsatisfactory. Based on graph neural network (NN) architecture, we present an extendable NN model to determine the Hamiltonian from ab initio data, with only local atomic structures as inputs. The rotational equivariance of the Hamiltonian is achieved by our complete local coordinates (LCs). The LC information, encoded using a convolutional NN and designed to preserve Hermitian symmetry, is used to map hopping parameters onto local structures. We demonstrate the performance of our model using graphene and SiGe random alloys as examples. We show that our NN model, although trained using small-size systems, can predict the Hamiltonian, as well as electronic properties such as band structures and densities of states for large-size systems within the ab initio accuracy, justifying its extensibility. In combination with the high efficiency of our model, which takes only seconds to get the Hamiltonian of a 1728-atom system, the present work provides a general framework to predict electronic properties efficiently and accurately, which provides new insights into computational physics and will accelerate the research for large-scale materials.

ID ACCURATE
AB Machine-learning (ML) force fields (FFs) enable an accurate and universal description of the potential energy surface of molecules and materials on the basis of a training set of ab initio data. However, large-scale applications of these methods rest on the possibility to train accurate ML models with a small number of ab initio data. In this respect, active-learning (AL) strategies, where the training set is self-generated by the model itself, combined with linear ML models are particularly promising. In this work, we explore an AL strategy based on linear regression and able to predict the model's uncertainty on predictions for molecular configurations not sampled by the training set, thus providing a straightforward recipe for the extension of the latter. We apply this strategy to the spectral neighbor analysis potential and show that only tens of ab initio simulations of atomic forces are required to generate FFs for room-temperature molecular dynamics at or close to chemical accuracy and which stability can be systematically improved by the user at modest computational expenses. Moreover, the method does not necessitate any conformational pre-sampling, thus requiring minimal user intervention and parametrization.

AB Advances in in situ marine life imaging have significantly increased the size and quality of available datasets, but automatic image analysis has not kept pace. Machine learning has shown promise for image processing, but its effectiveness is limited by several open challenges: the requirement for large expert-labeled training datasets, disagreement among experts, under-representation of various species and unreliable or overconfident predictions. To overcome these obstacles for automated underwater imaging, we combine and test recent developments in deep classifier networks and self-supervised feature learning. We use unlabeled images for pretraining deep neural networks to extract task-relevant image features, allowing learning algorithms to cope with scarcity in expert labels, and carefully evaluate performance in subsequent label-based tasks. Performance on rare classes is improved by applying data rebalancing together with a Bayesian correction to avoid biasing inferred in situ class frequencies. A divergence-based loss allows training on multiple, conflicting labels for the same image, leading to better estimates of uncertainty which we quantify with a novel accuracy measure. Together, these techniques can reduce the required label counts & SIM;100-fold while maintaining the accuracy of standard supervised training, shorten training time, cope with expert disagreement and reduce overconfidence.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Recent developments in the methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) allow researchers to explore the inner workings of deep neural networks (DNNs), revealing crucial information about input-output relationships and realizing how data connects with machine learning models. In this paper we explore interpretability of DNN models designed to identify jets coming from top quark decay in high energy proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. We review a subset of existing top tagger models and explore different quantitative methods to identify which features play the most important roles in identifying the top jets. We also investigate how and why feature importance varies across different XAI metrics, how correlations among features impact their explainability, and how latent space representations encode information as well as correlate with physically meaningful quantities. Our studies uncover some major pitfalls of existing XAI methods and illustrate how they can be overcome to obtain consistent and meaningful interpretation of these models. We additionally illustrate the activity of hidden layers as neural activation pattern diagrams and demonstrate how they can be used to understand how DNNs relay information across the layers and how this understanding can help to make such models significantly simpler by allowing effective model reoptimization and hyperparameter tuning. These studies not only facilitate a methodological approach to interpreting models but also unveil new insights about what these models learn. Incorporating these observations into augmented model design, we propose the particle flow interaction network model and demonstrate how interpretability-inspired model augmentation can improve top tagging performance.

AB Hydrogen bonding interactions, which are central to various physicochemical processes, are investigated in the present study using ab initio-based machine learning potential energy surfaces. Abnormally strong intramolecular O-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISO hydrogen bonds, occurring in & beta;-diketone enols of malonaldehyde and its derivatives, with substituents ranging from various electron-withdrawing to electron-donating functional groups, are studied. Machine learning force fields were constructed using a kernel-based force learning model employing ab initio molecular dynamics reference data. These models were used for molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperature, and dynamical properties were determined by computing proton transfer free-energy surfaces. The chemical systems studied here show progression toward barrier-less proton transfer events at an accuracy of correlated electronic structure methods. Markov state models of the conformational states indicate shorter intramolecular hydrogen bonds exhibiting higher proton transfer rates. We demonstrate how functional group substitution can modulate the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bonds by studying the thermodynamic and kinetic properties.

AB The modeling of multi-scale and multi-physics complex systems typically involves the use of scientific software that can optimally leverage extreme scale computing. Despite major developments in recent years, these simulations continue to be computationally intensive and time consuming. Here we explore the use of AI to accelerate the modeling of complex systems at a fraction of the computational cost of classical methods, and present the first application of physics informed neural operators (NOs) (PINOs) to model 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. Our AI models incorporate tensor Fourier NOs as their backbone, which we implemented with the TensorLY package. Our results indicate that PINOs can accurately capture the physics of MHD simulations that describe laminar flows with Reynolds numbers Re & LE;250. We also explore the applicability of our AI surrogates for turbulent flows, and discuss a variety of methodologies that may be incorporated in future work to create AI models that provide a computationally efficient and high fidelity description of MHD simulations for a broad range of Reynolds numbers. The scientific software developed in this project is released with this manuscript.

AB When a person's neuromuscular system is affected by an injury or disease, Activities-for-Daily-Living (ADL), such as gripping, turning, and walking, are impaired. Electroencephalography (EEG) and Electromyography (EMG) are physiological signals generated by a body during neuromuscular activities embedding the intentions of the subject, and they are used in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) or robotic rehabilitation systems. However, existing BCI or robotic rehabilitation systems use signal classification technique limitations such as (1) missing temporal correlation of the EEG and EMG signals in the entire window and (2) overlooking the interrelationship between different sensors in the system. Furthermore, typical existing systems are designed to operate based on the presence of dominant physiological signals associated with certain actions; (3) their effectiveness will be greatly reduced if subjects are disabled in generating the dominant signals. A novel classification model, named BIOFIS is proposed, which fuses signals from different sensors to generate inter-channel and intra-channel relationships. It explores the temporal correlation of the signals within a timeframe via a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) block. The proposed architecture is able to classify the various subsets of a full-range arm movement that performs actions such as forward, grip and raise, lower and release, and reverse. The system can achieve 98.6% accuracy for a 4-way action using EEG data and 97.18% accuracy using EMG data. Moreover, even without the dominant signal, the accuracy scores were 90.1% for the EEG data and 85.2% for the EMG data. The proposed mechanism shows promise in the design of EEG/EMG-based use in the medical device and rehabilitation industries.

AB To ensure that the robot can follow the planned trajectory, smooth switching between swinging legs and a smooth transition of motion process is realised. The previous motion planning work is analysed, and a method for improving the optimisation objective function and constraint conditions is proposed to eliminate the sudden change of acceleration and reduce the peak value of acceleration change. This method eliminates the impact phenomenon in the motor drive process and reduces the motor drive energy consumption, thus ensuring the smooth and consistent movement of the robot. The results show that the improved optimisation method has a better motion effect than the previous approach in terms of centre of mass motion speed, trajectory fitting and body posture change, and realises more robust motion of quadruped robots in a senseless state.

TI POSIX Lexing with Derivatives of Regular Expressions

DT Article
DE POSIX matching; Derivatives of Regular Expressions; Isabelle; HOL
AB Brzozowski introduced the notion of derivatives for regular expressions. They can be used for a very simple regular expression matching algorithm. Sulzmann and Lu cleverly extended this algorithm in order to deal with POSIX matching, which is the underlying disambiguation strategy for regular expressions needed in lexers. Their algorithm generates POSIX values which encode the information of how a regular expression matches a string-that is, which part of the string is matched by which part of the regular expression. In this paper we give our inductive definition of what a POSIX value is and show that Sulzmann and Lu's algorithm always generates such a value. We also show that our inductive definition of a POSIX value is equivalent to an alternative definition by Okui and Suzuki which identifies POSIX values as least elements according to an ordering of values.

ID GRAPHENE; INSTABILITIES; GENERATION
AB Understanding the mechanics and failure of materials at the nanoscale is critical for their engineering and applications. The accurate atomistic modeling of brittle failure with crack propagation in covalent crystals requires a quantum mechanics-based description of individual bond-breaking events. Artificial neural network potentials (NNPs) have emerged to overcome the traditional, physics-based modeling tradeoff between accuracy and accessible time and length scales. Previous studies have shown successful applications of NNPs for describing the structure and dynamics of molecular systems and amorphous or liquid phases of materials. However, their application to deformation and failure processes in materials is still uncommon. In this study, we discuss the apparent limitations of NNPs for the description of deformation and fracture under loadings and propose a way to generate and select training data for their employment in simulations of deformation and fracture simulations of crystals. We applied the proposed approach to 2D crystalline graphene, utilizing the density-functional tight-binding method for more efficient and extensive data generation in place of density functional theory. Then, we explored how the data selection affects the accuracy of the developed artificial NNPs. It revealed that NNP's reliability should not only be measured based on the total energy and atomic force comparisons for reference structures but also utilize comparisons for physical properties, e.g. stress-strain curves and geometric deformation. In sharp contrast to popular reactive bond order potentials, our optimized NNP predicts straight crack propagation in graphene along both armchair and zigzag (ZZ) lattice directions, as well as higher fracture toughness of ZZ edge direction. Our study provides significant insight into crack propagation mechanisms on atomic scales and highlights strategies for NNP developments of broader materials.

AB In this paper, multidimensional chaos systems called a trilinear chaotic system for encryption the color image is used. Combining the multi-dimensional chaotic system with encryption algorithms improves the security. The trilinear system is built from logistic and cubic maps and generates six completely ran-dom bijections T1(x), T2(x), T2(y), T3(x), T3(y), and T3 (z). The map T1(x) randomly shuffles the image pix-els, the two maps T2 (x) and T2(y) scramble the position of the pixels, and the other three maps change the pixel values. The correlations among the three components of RGB components are reduced, and the security of the algorithm increases. The simulation results demonstrated that the procedure has very large key spaces and a high level of security.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB Modern agricultural tractors are complex systems, in which multiple physical (and technological) domains interact to reach a wide set of competing goals, including work operational performance and energy efficiency. This complexity translates to the dynamic, multi-domain simulation models implemented to serve as digital twins, for rapid prototyping and effective pre-tuning, prior to bench and on-field testing. Consequently, a suitable simulation framework should have the capability to focus both on the vehicle as a whole and on individual subsystems. For each of the latter, multiple options should be available, with different levels of detail, to properly address the relevant phenomena, depending on the specific focus, for an optimal balance between accuracy and computation time. The methodology proposed here by the authors is based on the lumped parameter approach and integrates the models for the following subsystems in a modular context: internal combustion engine, hydromechanical transmission, vehicle body, and tyre-soil interaction. The model is completed by a load cycle module that generates stimulus time histories to reproduce the work load under real operating conditions. Traction capability is affected by vertical load on the wheels, which is even more relevant if the vehicle is travelling on an uncompacted soil and subject to a variable drawbar pull force as it is when ploughing. The vertical load is, in turn, heavily affected by vehicle dynamics, which can be accurately modelled via a full multibody implementation. The presented lumped parameter model is intended as a powerful simulation tool to evaluate tractor performance, both in terms of fuel consumption and traction dynamics, by considering the cascade phenomena from the wheel-ground interaction to the engine, passing through the dynamics of vehicle bodies and their mass transfer. Its capabilities and numerical results are presented for the simulation of a realistic ploughing operation.

AB We propose a new calculus SCL(EQ) for first-order logic with equality that only learns non-redundant clauses. Following the idea of CDCL (Conflict Driven Clause Learning) and SCL (Clause Learning from Simple Models) a ground literal model assumption is used to guide inferences that are then guaranteed to be non-redundant. Redundancy is defined with respect to a dynamically changing ordering derived from the ground literal model assumption. We prove SCL(EQ) sound and complete and provide examples where our calculus improves on superposition.

AB Cloud Computing can be defined as enabling computing resources to whoever want remotely upon demand. This necessarily requires using virtualization. A virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer that runs in virtualization software. Tasks coming from different users are passed to the virtual machines to be processed. This paper studies the load balancing problem among various VMs; to ensure that the network resources are distributed in a fair way between various clients. This paper proposes solving the load balancing problem using a combinatorial optimization approach named the Hungarian method. The proposed protocol is named LBCC-Hung (Load Balancing Protocol for Cloud Computing Based on Hungarian Method). Using simulation, the performance of LBCC-Hung is measured and compared with two well-known methods; MIN-MIN and First Come First Serve FCFS methods. The simulation results proved that LBCC-Hung overperforms the others two protocols, in terms of both the Makespan and the throughput and the virtual machine utilization deviation.& COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB The physics of Terahertz (THz) technology is the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum band between the infra-red and the microwave band with frequencies of about 0.1 to 30 THz. THz signals have gained adoption in medicine, telecommunications, security monitoring and imaging. THz imaging technology has the advan-tages of rapid imaging, strong penetration, and harmless to the human body hence widely used in a vari-ety of security environments and has become an alternative technology for X-ray imaging. However, THz is characterized by low resolution of THz images of which noise is an integral factor constituting a defect. Clarity of THz image is therefore essential at various security checkpoints to avoid life's dangers and treats. In this paper, we propose an efficient and high-performance defect detection model based on RetinaNet to recognize defects from captured images. The strategy of transfer learning is introduced to improve detection performance accuracy, which enhances the average precision (AP) by 19.2%. Contrary to existing THz image detection techniques on image recognition pertaining to the whole region of the image, we adopt a different approach via differential evolution search algorithm for optimization given the small proportion of defect area which improves the AP by 9.9% comparing with the fine-tuned model. For the problem of the lack of defect data samples, image augmentation is adopted to enrich our training samples, which improves the AP by 9.5%. As for the problem of low precision and recall in detect-ing blurred images, we firstly manually generate clear-blurred image pairs to train a GAN. Then, the blurred images are deblurred using a trained generator. We get 5.5% AP improvement on the testset using our approach. Compared with existing works, the optimized model based on RetinaNet has better detec-tion performance, subsequently, proving the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. & COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

ID STEGANALYSIS
AB Locating hidden data in digital images, otherwise called steganalysis, is a process of identifying the exis-tence of secret messages within digital images. Steganalysis is used to manage digital data transmission by detecting the possible hidden information that can be used to violate the network policy; hence, it helps the development of policies and regulations aimed at strong protection from cyber threats to indi-viduals' and organizations' data. The research works in the field of information security commonly focus on developing the locating approaches for non-adaptive steganography, which present a problem of less investigation of the complex challenge of locating the payload embedded with an adaptive stegano-graphic algorithm. In this article, we propose a method to locate hidden data in a digital image in three stages: a) Identification of the modification maps between the carrier and final images. b) Using the mod-ification maps as input to Mamdani fuzzy inference with four input membership functions: covariance map matrix, compass mean matrix, distance vector matrix, and pixel intensity matrix, and one output membership function, notably the fuzzy correlation maps. c) Feeding the fuzzy correlation maps to a con-volutional neural network to identify the pixels with confidential data from the innocent pixels. By exper-imenting with our method against four steganographic algorithms, namely, HILL, HUGO-BD, WOW, and S-UNIWARD, the recall rates for the four algorithms initially increase in a similar range and improve with increasing payload capacity, which justifies the outperformance of the proposed strategy over the exist-ing methods. & COPY; 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB This work aims to deal with the distributed heterogeneous unrelated parallel machine scheduling prob-lem (DHUPMSP) with minimizing total tardiness (TDD) and makespan. To solve this complex combina-torial optimization problem, this work proposed a knowledge and Pareto-based memetic algorithm (KPMA) which contains the following features: 1) four heuristic rules are designed including the shortest processing time rule, the minimum factory workload rule, the minimum machine finish time rule, and the earliest due date rule. Meanwhile, a hybrid heuristic initialization is developed to construct a popu-lation with great convergence and diversity; 2) four problem feature-based heuristic neighborhood struc-tures are designed to increase the success rate of local search; and 3) a simple elite strategy is developed to enhance the usage of historical elite solutions. Finally, to evaluate the performance of KMPA, it is com-pared to five state-of-art and run on 20 instances with different scales. The results of numerical experi-ments show that the proposed hybrid heuristic initialization can efficiently save computation resources to improve the initialized convergence. In addition, the knowledge-based neighborhood structures can vastly accelerate exploration. Moreover, the elite strategy can efficiently improve the diversity of the final non-dominated solutions set. The proposed KPMA has better performance than the state-of-art and has a strong ability to solve DHUPMSP.(c) 2023 THE AUTHORS.

AB There has been a rise of use of Autonomous Vehicles on public roads. With the predicted rise of road traffic accidents over the coming years, these vehicles must be capable of safely operate in the public domain. The field of pedestrian detection has significantly advanced in the last decade, providing high-level accuracy, with some technique reaching near-human level accuracy. However, there remains further work required for pedestrian intent prediction to reach human-level performance. One of the challenges facing current pedestrian intent predictors are the varying scales of pedestrians, particularly smaller pedestrians. This is because smaller pedestrians can blend into the background, making them difficult to detect, track or apply pose estimations techniques. Therefore, in this work, we present a novel intent prediction approach for multi-scale pedestrians using 2D pose estimation and a Long Short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. The pose estimator predicts keypoints for the pedestrian along the video frames. Based on the accumulation of these keypoints along the frames, spatio-temporal data is generated. This spatio-temporal data is fed to the LSTM for classifying the crossing behaviour of the pedestrians. We evaluate the performance of the proposed techniques on the popular Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving (JAAD) dataset and the new larger-scale Pedestrian Intention Estimation (PIE) dataset. Using data generalisation techniques, we show that the proposed technique outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques by up to 7%, reaching up to 94% accuracy while maintaining a comparable run-time of 6.1 ms.

ID EXPERIENCE
AB Regret is a universal emotion that arises from sadness, disappointment, or remorse about something that has occurred or that one has done or failed to do in the past. It typically involves wishing that a different decision had been made or that a different action had been taken. Although regret has been studied in various contexts such as psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, its expression and analysis on social media using natural language processing techniques is a relatively recent research topic that warrants further investigation. In this paper, we present a study of regret and its expression on social media platforms. Specifically, we present a novel dataset of Reddit texts that have been classified into three classes: Regret by Action, Regret by Inaction, and No Regret. We then use this dataset to investigate the language used to express regret on Reddit and to identify the domains of text that are most commonly associated with regret. Our findings show that Reddit users are most likely to express regret for past actions, particularly in the domain of relationships. We also found that deep learning models using GloVe embedding outperformed other models in all experiments, indicating the effectiveness of GloVe for representing the meaning and context of words in the domain of regret. Overall, our study provides valuable insights into the nature and prevalence of regret on social media, as well as the potential of deep learning and word embeddings for analyzing and understanding emotional language in online text. These findings have implications for the development of natural language processing algorithms and the design of social media platforms that support emotional expression and communication.

AB Previous research on the integrated scheduling problems generally considers the production and distribution stages, but ignores the arrangement of on-hand inventory saved in the warehouse. However, the overall optimal solution to meet customer demands must require a high degree of coordination between the production, inventory and distribution stages. Encouraged by this, we study a new production-inventory-distribution integrated scheduling problem, in which the production plan in a homogeneous flowshop environment, allocation plan of on-hand inventory and distribution decision of three-party logistics provider, are considered simultaneously. A mixed integer linear programming model with the goal of minimizing total earliness/tardiness penalty costs and total energy consumption is built for the problem. A modified NSGA-II (abbreviated as MNSGA) is proposed to solve the problem. In the MNSGA, a well-tailored three-layer encoding method is presented for the chromosome representation. The adaptive crossover and mutation operators are developed for a good global search. In addition, an objective-oriented local search operator is designed to improve the local exploitation ability. The superiority of the proposed MNSGA is verified by comparing four popular multi-objective optimization algorithms based on 540 benchmark instances. Furthermore, the proposed integration mode is demonstrated to be effective by comparing it with several sequential scheduling methods commonly used in actual production.

AB Feature extraction networks play a crucial role in classification algorithms. However, most convolutional neural networks use the form of residual block stacking to extract downstream features of images, and this simple form is not sufficient to obtain better classification performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a YOLOX detection framework based on an improved ConvNeXt which incorporates many advantages of Swin-Transformer with efficient classification performance. To address the problems of unstable IOU convergence and inaccurate regression coordinates of the algorithm, this paper adopts Manhattan distance as the new penalty term, and the new loss function combines the advantages of Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance, which has no gradient explosion in the early training period and can drop smoothly to a stable point in the late training period. The proposed algorithm is robust to negative effects such as dust, light, shadows, and occlusions, and is well-suited for masked-face detection in industrial and public scenarios. The proposed model is tested on the VOC dataset and the AIZOO open-source masked-face dataset, obtaining 5.58% AP improvement on the VOC dataset and reaching 96.665% AP on the masked-face dataset, which is better than other algorithms.

AB Encryption techniques have been proposed to improve security using chaos theory, mathematical computations, DNA computations, substitution-masking operations, and neural networks. However, existing encryption techniques have focused on intra-block variations to improve security and largely ignored the impact of inter-block variations. Inter-block variations are critical because they ensure that the encryption of a block is affected by its internal variation and also by the variations of all its previous blocks. This can significantly increase the confusion and the technique's ability to resist security attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid technique that addresses the weaknesses of existing techniques by combining both intra- and inter-block variations to greatly improve security. The proposed technique uses chaotic systems to increase confusion and conceal the key. It also incorporates fuzzy encoding and distortion methods that use both inter- and intra-block variations to further strengthen security. The technique was rigorously evaluated using state-of-the-art testing tools. The evaluation showed that the technique is effective because it passed the randomness tests with a high rate that exceeds the threshold for effective techniques, and it has an execution time that is better than state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Assessing and comparing the overall performances of robotic applications amid the COVID-19 pandemic is a key task for local governments and relevant stakeholders, but has yet to be investigated. To accomplish this task, this study proposes a partial-consensus and unequal-authority fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach. In the proposed methodology, each evaluator first uses fuzzy geometric mean (FGM) to derive the fuzzy priorities of criteria for assessing the performance of each robotic application. Subsequently, considering the unequal authority levels of evaluators and the lack of an overall consensus, the partial-consensus fuzzy weighted intersection (PCFWI) operator is proposed to aggregate the derivation results. Finally, alpha-cut operations (ACO)-based fuzzy weighted average (FWA) is applied to evaluate the overall performance of each robotic application. The partial-consensus and unequal-authority fuzzy collaborative intelligence approach have been applied to assess the overall performances of four robotic applications amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the experimental results, the Xenex LightStrike robot was named the #1 robotics application during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by the Brain Navi Nasal Swab Robot. Furthermore, the proposed methodology outperforms three existing methods by up to 21% in preserving evaluators' original judgments.

ID DESIGN
AB The majority of countries use solar energy systems that are composed of several solar plants to generate electricity. It produces direct current (DC) electricity by converting sunlight. Power is produced using stationary solar panels. There is a small amount of efficiency loss in this system. To increase the efficiency of the sun-based board, a single-axis solar panel is then created and proposed that spins on a vertical axis (east-west) up to 180 degrees. It is intended to increase the efficiency of the sun-based board, which will rotate in accordance with the direction of the sun on both a horizontal (North-South) and vertical (East-West) axis, up to 180 degrees, for greater exposure to the sun than the single hub sun-based global positioning system. Moreover, each solar panel loses some percentage of its effectiveness due to dust pollution. In the majority of power plants, cleaning is done by hand. In most plants, the cleaning cycle is carried out physically. Therefore, the goal of this research is to increase the efficiency of the sun-powered board by attaching a cleaning framework to the board to naturally remove residue from its exterior over time. The proposed framework combines a dual-hub solar-powered global positioning system with a scheduled cleaning system in a single module. Efficiency is improved over stationary and single-axis solar trackers by using this integrated model.

AB With the proliferation in the internet of things (IoT), a variety of delay sensitive applications have emerged over the past few years. Fog computing acts a viable computing paradigm for meeting the requirements of IoT applications. However, heterogeneous IoT tasks, resource constrained fog nodes makes task scheduling a challenging task. Efficient task scheduling reduces the computation cost, latency, energy and enhances the utilization of resources. In this paper, we propose the improved version of the meta-heuristic algorithm spider monkey optimization (SMO). We propose greedy task scheduling SMO (gTS-SMO) and semi-greedy task scheduling SMO (sgTS-SMO) for efficient task scheduling in fog computing environment. The main aim is minimize delay and energy consumption while considering the constraints of deadline and violation time. The system is evaluated based on the parameters of deadline violation time, makespan, energy consumption, total cost, and degree of imbalance. The results shows gTS-SMO reduces the violation time by 13.86%, 88.38% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and particle swarm optimization (PSO) respectively. The results also depicts the outperformance of gTS-SMO in terms of makespan and energy consumption. Makespan is reduced by 6.28%, and 57.75% and energy consumption by 5.74% and 53.65% on comparison with sgTS-SMO and PSO respectively.

AB Proper scheduling of jobs is essential for modern production systems to work effectively. The hybrid flow shop scheduling problem is a scheduling problem with many applications in the industry. The problem has also attracted much attention from researchers due to its complexity. This study addresses the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem (HFSP), which considers unrelated parallel machines at each stage and the machine eligibility constraints. HFSP is a well-known NP-hard problem with the aim of minimizing the makespan. Owing to the complexity of the problem, this study develops constraint programming (CP) models for the HFSP and its extensions: the no-wait HFSP, the blocking HFSP, the HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times, the no-wait HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times, and the blocking HFSP with sequence-dependent setup times. We also propose two mixed-integer linear programming models (MILP) for no-wait and blocking HSFPs with sequence-dependent setup times. The performances of the CP models were tested against their MILP counterparts using randomly generated instances and benchmark instances from the literature. The computational results indicated that the proposed CP model outperformed the best MILP solutions for benchmark instances. It is also more effective for finding high-quality solutions for larger problem instances.

AB Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a common form of breast cancer that affects women. In traditional medical practice, physicians have to manually test and classify areas which are suspected to be cancerous. However, the literature strongly indicates that the manual segmentation process performed by medical practitioners is neither time efficient nor accurate, as it relies on their subjective judgment. This paper introduces a model called residual attention neural network breast cancer classification (RANN-BCC) to help medical practitioners in the cancer diagnostic process. RANN-BCC utilizes residual neural network (ResNet) as an expert-supportive method to aid medical practitioners in cancer diagnosis. The implementation of RANN-BCC can support the classification of whole slide imaging (WSI) into non-IDC and IDC without prior information about the presence of a cancerous lesion. The classification results demonstrate that the RANN-BCC model has achieved 92.45% accuracy, 0.98 recall, 0.91 precision, and 0.94 F-score which has outperformed other models such as CNN, AlexNet, Residual Neural Network 34 (ResNet34), and Feed-Forward Neural Network. The developed RANN-BCC model aims to help medical experts to classify IDC and non-IDC of breast cancer by learning the feature content of medical images.

AB Graph neural network-based collaborative filtering methods have achieved excellent performance in recommender systems. However, previous works have primarily focused on representation using the entire graph or a single sampled subgraph, which fails to address the issue of noise introduced by prolonged ineffective interactions. Moreover, these approaches lack the capacity to model temporal information in an inductive manner, thereby limiting their ability to fully capture the evolving dynamic interests of users over time in a real world scenario. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel personalized inductive spatiotemporal graph neural network-based framework PistGNN. PistGNN extracts multiple temporal-aware subgraphs from user-item pairs to avoid long-time gap meaningless interactions, which are then fed into a spatiotemporal graph neural network module. It is worth noting that PistGNN trains the model only by relying on subgraphs extracted from bipartite graphs, without depending on global information, and is therefore capable of predicting for new users or items. Finally, we propose an attention-based meta-learning method to personalize the aggregation of subgraphs' embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of PistGNN over both inductive and transductive baseline methods.

AB Outstanding steps towards intelligent transportation systems with autonomous vehicles have been taken in the past few years. Nevertheless, the safety issue in autonomous vehicles is critical and remains to be fully solved. Sensor data provide information about the internal status of the system and the impact of its external environment, where the occurrence of sensor data anomalies indicates the existence of potential safety risks. Therefore, in this work, a taxonomy for potential sensor data anomaly sources from the perspective of road vehicle safety is proposed, motivated by the lack of a unified comprehensive taxonomy of sensor data anomaly identification for autonomous vehicles. In this context, sources are divided into; 1) fault or failure of the components or subsystems; 2) failure of the adaptability to the external environment; 3) cyber-attacks; and 4) faults or design deficiencies of sensors. Based on the taxonomy proposed, related works, and in particular, countermeasures for the four potential sources of sensor data anomalies in autonomous vehicles are then reviewed. In the context of providing a comprehensive discussion, other taxonomies of potential sources causing sensor data anomalies for autonomous vehicles and the issue of interpretability of sensor data anomalies are also discussed, providing insight into the strengths of the proposed taxonomy.

AB The prediction of particulate matter (PM) concentration around open-pit mining is crucial for its control. To achieve this, machine learning (ML) techniques have been attempted in PM estimation without reaching their full potential. In the current study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is employed for the prediction of PM2.5 concentration (PM < 2.5 mu m), PM10 concentration (PM < 10 mu m), and total suspended particulate (TSP). The influence of training algorithms and epochs on the modeling accuracy of ANN is investigated. Moreover, the convergence of ANN modeling is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. Compared with the quasi-Newton method (QNM) and conjugate gradient backpropagation (CGB), the one-step secant algorithm (OSSM) is the most suitable training algorithm for PM concentration prediction. Using the 0.1% bound as a convergence criterion, 500 Monte Carlo simulations are enough to get the converged results. The ANN-OSSM achieves high accuracy in PM concentration prediction. The R values on the testing set of PM2.5, PM10, and TSP are 0.887, 0.943, 0.886, respectively. Compared with the results in the literature, accuracy improvement is achieved using ANNOSSM, with R increases from 0.86 to 0.92 (TSP dataset), from 0.91 to 0.94 (PM2.5 dataset), and from 0.84 to 0.89 (PM10 dataset). The present ML model is higher in accuracy and more straightforward in methodology compared with the hybridized model in the literature, which will promote its industrial application in the near future.

AB In this paper, we propose a holistic AI-based pharmacovigilance optimization approach using patient's social media data. Instead of focusing on the detection and identification of Adverse Drug Events (ADE) in social media posts in single time points, we propose a holistic approach that looks at the evolution of different user behavior indicators in time. We examine various NLP-based indicators such as word frequency, semantic similarity, Adverse Drug Reactions mentions, and sentiment analysis. We introduce a classification approach to identify normal vs. abnormal time periods based on patient comments. This approach, along with user behavior indicators, can optimize the pharmacovigilance process by flagging the need for immediate attention and further investigation. We specifically focus on the Levothyrox (R) case in France, which sparked media attention due to changes in the medication formula and affected patient behavior on medical forums. For classification, we propose a deep learning architecture called Word Cloud Convolutional Neural Network (WCCNN), trained on word clouds from patient comments. We evaluate different temporal resolutions and NLP pre-processing techniques, finding that monthly resolution and the proposed indicators can effectively detect new safety signals, with an accuracy of 75%. We have made the code open source, available via github.

ID MODEL
AB Neural network (NN)-based models have recently achieved outstanding results in short-term traffic prediction. However, most of these are based on the regression approach and trained to generate a single data point as a predicted value for future timesteps, which does not provide information on prediction uncertainty and limits its performance under different traffic conditions. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel, highdimensional distributional prediction (HDP) framework. This method has been validated by a series of experiments using the Caltrans Performance Measurement System dataset and four widely used NN models. The results suggest that the proposed HDP scheme can help existing NN structures to (1) generate adaptive distributional predictions for quantifying the uncertainty of multiple targets, and (2) gain better point prediction in terms of accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predicted speed distributions can be used for travel time estimation, outperforming other traditional methods in unexpected traffic conditions such as traffic incidents.

AB Metaheuristic algorithms have been widely used in many application fields and have achieved some good results, but there is still a strong demand for these algorithms in different engineering application fields. In this paper, a novel metaheuristics algorithm named Virus Control Optimizer (VCO) is proposed to solve engineering optimization problems. The algorithm is inspired by the prevention and control mechanism of COVID-19, which designed an effective solution space partition strategy and a multisubpopulation collaborative search framework. This framework will maintain the whole population's diversity while making an accurate search on the local optimal region. Compared to other existing algorithms, VCO has a unique search mechanism and can achieve better convergence efficiency, especially in engineering optimization problems. The search capabilities of VCO are assessed by testing on 12 classical benchmark functions, 29 unconstrained benchmark functions obtained from CEC 2017, 4 constrained engineering optimization problems, 5 real-world constrained problems from CEC 2020 and 3 simulation test of multi-UAVs path planning problems. In addition, VCO is compared with other typical and state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms, our results reveal that VCO can obtain better solutions than the comparison algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Drowsiness is a state of fatigue or sleepiness characterized by a strong urge to sleep. It is correlated with a progressive decline in response time, compromised processing of available information, more errors in short -term memory, and reduced vigilance behaviors. The electroencephalogram (EEG), a recording of the brain's electrical activities, has demonstrated the most robust association with drowsiness. As a result, EEG is widely recognized as a dependable indicator for evaluating drowsiness, fatigue, and performance levels. In this survey paper, we thoroughly investigate the application of shallow and deep neural network approaches utilizing EEG signals for the detection of fatigue and drowsiness. As far as our knowledge extends, this is the pioneering survey paper dedicated to exploring this specific research domain. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the diverse EEG features utilized in the detection of fatigue and drowsiness, the different types of neural networks, and the reported performance of these methods in the literature. Additionally, the paper thoroughly examines the challenges and limitations associated with EEG-based fatigue and drowsiness detection and highlights directions for future research. The survey aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the existing methods in EEG-based fatigue and drowsiness detection, serving as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working in the respective field.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Text line segmentation is an important step in the historical document image analysis pipeline to supply useful information for recognition, keyword spotting and indexing. Many handcrafted-based and learning-based approaches have been developed to cope with text line extraction challenges. In this work we present a hybrid technique which combines a convolutional-based denoising task and heuristic Seam Carving framework. We propose the following changes to the original Seam Carving: (1) We applied adaptive slice to anticipate miss-extraction on a short text during medial seam computation. (2) We applied a triple smoothing to find the best local maxima of the smoothed horizontal projection profile which represents candidate medial seams. (3) We utilized five post-processing steps aimed at reconstructing a more precise medial seam. Three different palm leaf data sets: old Sundanese, old Balinese, and old Khmer, have been used to compare Convolutional Seam Carving (CSC) to several baseline methods, including the original Seam Carving. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other current handcrafted-based baselines on all three palm leaf manuscript (PLM) data sets. On the old Sundanese data sets, CSC can produce a significant improvement of the performance rate compared to all other baseline approaches, and it also enhance the measurement on old Balinese and old Khmer datasets. In the ablation study, we discovered that a foreground extraction step is not only able to reduce noises and color degradation but also provide better separation of text region. Following that, an adaptive slice and triple smoothing approach contribute to solve the text length variation problem. Finally, post-processing steps were effective in connecting discontinuous medial seam. The code has been published in https://github.com/erickpaulus/text-line-segmentation.

   language model cognitive analysis
AB In the development of a new product, concept generation is a crucial stage, as it determines much of the cost of the product lifetime. The process of generating concepts that meet customer requirements, however, can be challenging due to incomplete information, chaotic design constraints, and complicated design iterations. Deep learning-based pretrained language models can be a potential solution to overcome these limitations. But current methods are limited by the gap between the language used in design-related documents such as patent and the casual spoken language as the latter reflects the thinking process of concept generation. In this paper, we propose a key concepts derivation approach based on cognitive analysis to address challenges in product design and to effectively incorporate prior knowledge. This approach leverages a pretrained language model to extract information from multiple sources of textual data and represents design thinking in a vector space. We conduct a Design-by-Analogy based verbal protocol analysis experiment for high-speed elevators to collect verbal data and establish a design thinking corpus. Based on this, our approach is employed for key concepts derivation in product design and explore how solutions are generated to realize specific customer-required functionality. By analyzing the types of design stimuli, the effectiveness of our approach in deriving key design concepts are demonstrated with respect to novelty and feasibility.

This work presents a novel method for evolving deep neural networks by adapting the principles of Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming, a subfield of Genetic Programming, and Semantic Learning Machine. Our approach integrates evolution seamlessly through natural selection with the optimization power of backpropagation in deep learning, enabling the incremental growth of neural networks' neurons across generations.

AB Deep learning method has been developed for pavement crack detection. The improvement in detection accuracy is limited by the image quantity and detection algorithm in engineering practice. This study proposes an innovative method to efficiently identify pavement cracks by moderating the training process. The dataset was established after a sensitivity analysis by considering the shooting height and image volume. The DeepLabv3+ model was used to train the originally collected images, and the CLAHE-augmented images were used for prediction. The result showed that the detection accuracy was enhanced by an average of 1.51%. This new method was validated in two scenarios, leading to average accuracies of 95.07% and 96.61% in detecting linear and alligator cracks, respectively. This detection process avoids repeatedly investing new images in model training, accelerating crack recognition by augmenting the images to be detected. The proposed method fulfills the requirements of engineering practice, based on which a road maintenance strategy is proposed.

AB Non-stationarity of EEG signals leads to high variability between subjects, making it challenging to directly use data from other subjects (source domain) for the classifier in the current subject (target domain). In this study, we propose MI-DAGSC to address domain adaptation challenges in EEG-based motor imagery (MI) decoding. By combining domain-level information, class-level information, and inter-sample structure information, our model effectively aligns the feature distributions of source and target domains. This work is an extension of our previous domain adaptation work MI-DABAN (Li et al., 2023). Based on MI-DABAN, MI-DAGSC designs Sample-Feature Blocks (SFBs) and Graph Convolution Blocks (GCBs) to focus on intra-sample and inter-sample information. The synergistic integration of SFBs and GCBs enable the model to capture comprehensive information and understand the relationship between samples, thus improving representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a triplet loss to enhance the alignment and compactness of feature representations. Extensive experiments on real EEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MI-DAGSC, confirming that our method makes a valuable contribution to the MI-EEG decoding. Moreover, it holds great potential for various applications in brain-computer interface systems and neuroscience research. And the code of the proposed architecture in this study is available under https://github.com/zhangdx21/MI-DAGSC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Graph neural networks; Signed attention mechanism; Exactly higher-order
   neighborhood aggregation; Heterophily graph
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective deep learning methodology used to encode graph-structured data. Several popular GNNs have demonstrated excellent results in various downstream tasks, including node classification and visualization, especially when homophily occurs in graphs where connected nodes may share identical features or labels. Although recent models can extend GNNs beyond homophily, two fundamental weaknesses limit their expressive ability. First, most of the existing GNNs fail to adaptively aggregate information from different neighbors, especially negative information from different classes. Even worse, they fail to encode the positional information, leading to the inevitable conflation of information from different neighborhoods that should be specified with different importance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel graph neural network model based on the Signed Attention mechanism (SA), namely SAGNN. Specifically, the signed attention mechanism is presented to adaptively learn the complex relationship between exact neighboring nodes. Compared with the original non-negative attention mechanism, SA aggregates information from both positive and negative neighbors, especially on graphs with heterophily. Furthermore, we propose an Exactly Higher-Order Neighborhood Aggregation that implicitly encodes positional information to specify the importance of different neighborhoods. Extensive experiments conducted on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGNN model learns more robust and expressive representations, and achieves superior performance on node classification and visualization tasks.

DE Incentive mechanism; Federated learning; Multi-player evolutionary game;
   Evolutionarily stable strategy
AB Federated learning has emerged as a new way of data sharing. The participants in the federation tend to choose different strategies based on their benefits, which is formalized into an evolutionary game model. Existing techniques can limit the malicious behavior of participants by detecting betrayers or weakening their influence. The problem that whether there is an incentive mechanism which makes participants spontaneously choose to cooperate honestly and maintains the stability of the federated learning system is urgent. In this paper, we develop a multi-player evolutionary game model in federated learning. We model the federated learning process by evaluating the payoffs of the central server, internal clients, and external clients. The stability of the federated learning system in the long-term dynamics process is assessed by seeking the evolutionarily stable equilibrium solutions. In this paper, mathematical reasoning and computer simulation are combined to analyze the impact of reward and punishment strategies in incentive mechanisms on the game process and game equilibrium. An incentive mechanism is designed to achieve evolutionarily stable equilibrium while make most clients join the federation spontaneously and cooperate honestly. Finally, the effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of this incentive mechanism are verified by sensitivity analysis and Lyapunov stability theory.

DT Article
DE Leader learning; Loss function learning; Neural network classification;
   Cost-sensitive learning
AB Deep learning, based on Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), typically aims to fit the ideal outputs of all samples due to its large capacity. However, models trained based on empirical losses like cross entropy (CE) or mean square error (MSE), often learn unnecessary information during classification, leading to premature overfitting. On the other hand, the result-focused loss functions, i.e., zero-one loss or hinge loss, are hard to optimize and thus are rarely applied directly in neural network. This paper proposes a novel leader learning in classification, where CE is gradually trained by classification results using sample-dependent cost-sensitive learning. As complementary, the stepwise-changed CE covers the deficiency on classification error while preserving the advantage of fast convergence. In this way, the deviation between CE and classification error can be corrected. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed leader learning has a more significant convergence trend than the baseline algorithms. Moreover, the loss function learned from a specific dataset has broad generality that can be transferred to other models as prior knowledge.

AB Tremendous progresses have been made in remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) task in recent years, yet there still some unresolved problems: (1) facing the gap between the visual features and semantic concepts, (2) reasoning the higher-level relationships between semantic concepts. In this work, we focus on injecting high-level visual-semantic interaction into RSIC model. Firstly, the semantic concept extractor (SCE), end-to end trainable, precisely captures the semantic concepts contained in the RSIs. In particular, the visual-semantic co-attention (VSCA) is designed to grain coarse concept-related regions and region-related concepts for multi modal interaction. Furthermore, we incorporate the two types of attentive vectors with semantic-level relational features into a consensus exploitation (CE) block for learning cross-modal consensus-aware knowledge. The experiments on three benchmark data sets show the superiority of our approach compared with the reference methods.

AB We present a new image complexity metric. Existing complexity metrics cannot distinguish meaningful content from noise, and give a high score to white noise images, which contain no meaningful information. We use the minimum description length principle to determine the number of clusters and designate certain points as outliers and, hence, correctly assign white noise a low score. The presented method is a step towards humans' ability to detect when data contain a meaningful pattern. It also has similarities to theoretical ideas for measuring meaningful complexity. We conduct experiments on seven different sets of images, which show that our method assigns the most accurate scores to all images considered. Additionally, comparing the different levels of the hierarchy of clusters can reveal how complexity manifests at different scales, from local detail to global structure. We then present ablation studies showing the contribution of the components of our method, and that it continues to assign reasonable scores when the inputs are modified in certain ways, including the addition of Gaussian noise and the lowering of the resolution.

TI ShuffleTrans: Patch-wise weight shuffle for transparent object
   segmentation
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Transparent object segmentation; Semantic segmentation
AB Transparent objects widely exist in the world. The task of transparent object segmentation is challenging as the object lacks its own texture. The cue of shape information therefore gets more critical. Most existing methods, however, rely on the mechanism of simple convolution, which is good at local cues and performs weakly on global cues like shape. To solve this problem, an operation named Patch-wise Weight Shuffle is proposed to bring in the global context cue by being combined with the dynamic convolution. A network ShuffleTrans that recognizes shape better is then designed based on this operation. Besides, fitter for this task, two auxiliary modules are presented in ShuffleTrans: a Boundary and Direction Refinement Module which collects two additional information, and a Channel Attention Enhancement Module that assists the above operation. Experiments on four texture-less object segmentation datasets and two normal datasets verify the effectiveness and generality of the method. Especially, the ShuffleTrans achieved 74.93% mIoU on the Trans10k v2 test set, which is more accurate than existing methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID EDGE-DETECTION
AB Existing Deep-Learning-based contour detectors suffer from the issues of the sharpness and the correctness of their predictions, which often need offline post-processing to sharpen the results as well as improve model performance. In this work, we present a novel method that can learn to refine object contour in training and directly output crisp object boundaries in inference. To this end, we first introduce a keypoint-focal loss that draws point-based attention to the isolated contour annotations. It allows an edge detector to jointly optimize the appearance thickness and the localization accuracy of predictions in the training procedure. Moreover, we present a regularization loss to further improve the performance of an edge detector. Lastly, we present the Contour Transformer model for precisely localizing object boundaries in images. We repurpose and integrate a Transformer-style hyper module into an encoder-decoder network, effectively aggregating global contextual information on high-level features and significantly enhancing the discriminative power for classifying foreground/background pixels. We train and test our Attention and Contour Transformer detector (ACTD) on four widely adopted datasets, i.e., BSDS500, NYUD, Multi-Cue, and RoadNet. The proposed method achieves an ODS F-score of 0.826 on BSDS500 and an ODS F-score of 0.783 on NYUD, outperforming previous top detectors.

AB Object tracking aims to estimate the position of a given object in subsequent video sequences. One of the research focuses in tracking is feature fusion as the similar response maps generated by feature fusion can significantly affect tracking accuracy. However, traditional naive correlation and depthwise correlation blur the spatial information and do not perform well in low resolution, similar objects, partial occlusion and other scenes. In this paper, we propose a progressive attention tracker called PRAT. It performs sufficient similarity learning between the template and search region to achieve more accurate object tracking. Specifically, PRAT performs self-enhancement on template features, and uses unidirectional cross enhancement and progressive enhancement to fuse template features into search features. Therefore, the search region features have the ability of target perception. In addition, we also design a convolution-based network to replace the FFN in the original Transformer to enhance local semantics. Experiments on six challenging benchmarks show that our PRAT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Particularly, on the challenging UAV123, PRAT sets a new record with 0.703 SUC score. PRAT runs at 63 fps on GPU.

AB Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can be trained on resource-constrained devices at low computational costs. There has been little attention to training them on a large-scale distributed system like federated learning. Federated Learning (FL) can be exploited to perform collaborative training for higher accuracy, involving multiple resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we introduce SNNs into asynchronous federated learning (AFL), which adapts to the statistical heterogeneity of users and complex communication environments. A novel fusion weight based on information age and average spike rate is designed, which aims to reduce the impact of model staleness. Numerical experiments validate SNNs on federated learning with MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN benchmarks, achieving better accuracy and desirable convergence under Non-IID settings.

TI Privacy-preserving graph convolution network for federated item

DE Item recommendation; Federated learning; User privacy; Graph neural
   network
AB In traditional recommender systems, we often build models based on a centralized storage of user data, which however will lead to user privacy concerns and risks. In this paper, we study an emerging and important recommendation problem called federated item recommendation (FIR), in which a recommendation model is built with decentralized data of user-item interactions in a privacy-aware manner, i.e., the personal behavior data of each user does not leave the owner. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) has been widely recognized as a state-of-the-art solution for item recommendation with implicit feedback since it is able to model the high-order connectivity between users and items. However, it is very challenging to exploit the high-order connectivity information in a decentralized user-item interaction graph without compromising user privacy. To address that, we propose a GNN-based federated recommendation framework, i.e., privacy-preserving graph convolution network (P-GCN), for the studied problem of FIR. Our P-GCN can leverage the high-order connectivity information like a centralized GCN model such as LightGCN, though it is built using a decentralized user-item graph. To achieve that, we design a novel privacy-preserving graph convolution approach based on secure aggregation and employ item-based user representation to compensate for the performance loss it causes due to the protection of user privacy. Moreover, we improve a group-wise concealing strategy for protecting user privacy. Empirical studies on three datasets show that our PGCN can achieve similar or even better performance comparing with the non-federated (i.e., centralized) counterpart, and outperforms all the existing federated methods for the studied problem.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANN) are widely used machine learning models. Their widespread use has attracted a lot of interest in their robustness. Many studies show that ANN's performance can be highly vulnerable to input manipulation such as adversarial attacks and covariate drift. Therefore, various techniques that focus on improving ANN's robustness have been proposed in the last few years. However, most of these works have mostly focused on image data. In this paper, we investigate the role of discretization in improving ANN's robustness on tabular datasets. Two custom ANNlayers-D1-Layer and D2-Layer (collectively called D-Layers) are proposed. The two layers integrate discretization during the training phase to improve ANN's ability to defend against adversarial attacks. Additionally, D2-Layer integrates dynamic discretization during testing phase as well, to provide a unified strategy to handle adversarial attacks and covariate drift. The experimental results on 24 publicly available datasets show that our proposed D-Layers add much-needed robustness to ANN for tabular datasets.

AB Semantic segmentation, which is a fundamental task in computer vision. Every pixel will have a specific semantic class assigned to it through semantic segmentation methods. Embedded systems and mobile devices are difficult to deploy high-accuracy segmentation algorithms. Despite the rapid development of semantic segmentation, the balance between speed and accuracy must be improved. As a solution to the above problems, we created a cross-scale fusion attention mechanism network called CFANet, which fuses feature maps from different scales. We first design a novel efficient residual module (ERM), which applies both dilation convolution and factorized convolution. Our CFANet is mainly constructed from ERM. Subsequently, we designed a new multi-branch channel attention mechanism (MCAM) to refine the feature maps at different levels. Experiment results show that CFANet achieved 70.6% mean intersection over union (mIoU) and 67.7% mIoU on Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, respectively, with inference speeds of 118 FPS and 105 FPS on NVIDIA RTX2080Ti GPU cards with 0.84M parameters.

AB In the urban landscaping field, training datasets for instance segmentation in the detection of building facades are needed for complex analysis and simulation based on data. Manual dataset generation methods are costly, so automatic generation is preferred. However, previous methods are costly and are more reliant on 3D real-city models than LOD2. The objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating synthetic datasets for instance segmentation using an image translation technique and procedural modeling. The image translation technique is used to generate street view images for training data, and procedural modeling can automatically specify the composition of generated street view images and generate annotation data, as well as a variety of 3D models. The proposed method generates various kinds of synthetic data at a rate of 4.45 s per set, and the model trained on the generated dataset can detect real buildings for each instance.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Electricity markets need to continuously evolve to address the growing complexity of a predominantly renewable energy-driven, highly interconnected, and sector-integrated energy system. Simulation models allow testing market designs before implementation, which offers advantages for market robustness and efficiency. This work presents a novel approach to simulate the electricity market by using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for representing revenue-maximizing market participants. The learning capability makes the agents highly adaptive, thereby facilitating a rigorous performance evaluation of market mechanisms under challenging yet practical conditions. Through distinct test cases that vary the number and size of learning agents in an energy-only market, we demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to diagnose market manipulation and reflect market liquidity.

AB Despite advances in instrumentation and measurement techniques, it is still necessary to update numerical models to simulate or predict some structural responses, for example. Thus, this work proposes a metaheuristic framework based on hybrid agents, an approach within the Artificial Intelligence (AI) topics for updating Finite Element (FE) numerical models. This framework aims to provide flexible non-deterministic strategies to guide the updating process, ranging from simple local search procedures to complex learning processes. Two case studies are presented: (i) a free-free aluminium beam tested under laboratory conditions and; (ii) a catamaran tested during a sea trial under real operating conditions. The updating process aimed to optimize the stiffness matrix while maintaining the mass matrix unchanged. The objective function seeks to minimize the differences between numerical and experimental modal parameters, namely, natural frequencies and vibration modes. Results from the digital twin framework showed that the difference in natural frequencies significantly decreased, for example, 9% to 1% for the free-free aluminium beam and 15% to 4% for the catamaran's main deck, when comparing the experimental with the updated FE model. As for the updated FE vibration modes, the Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) values decreased slightly in both cases but within the acceptable MAC values (above 0.9), thus showing good consistency with the experimental vibration modes. In the end, the proposed framework was able to update the FE model directly using its respective reduced model, circumventing the"black box"of commercial packages.

AB Colloids subjected to electrical stimuli exhibit a reconfiguration that might be used to store information and potentially compute. In a colloidal suspension of ZnO nanoparticles in DMSO, we investigated the learning, memorization, time and stimulation's voltage dependence of conductive network formation. The relationships between the critical resistance and stimulation time have been reconstructed. The critical voltage (i.e., the stimulation voltage required to drop the resistance) was found to decrease as stimulation time increased. We characterized a dispersion of conductive ZnO nanoparticles in the DMSO polymeric matrix using FESEM and UV-visible absorption spectrum.

TI Consistent penalizing field loss for zero-shot image retrieval
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Image retrieval; Zero-shot; Deep metric learning; Computer vision; Deep
   learning
AB Zero-shot image retrieval involves retrieving images of unseen classes using a query image of the same class. To determine whether a given image is of the same class as the query image, a universal threshold of similarity measures is needed, as class-specific thresholds are not feasible for unseen classes. However, existing methods for zero-shot image retrieval focus on pushing a margin between intra-class and inter-class similarities for each class during the training phase. This approach can result in varying decision boundaries between intraand inter-class similarities across classes, which could compromise performance when a universal threshold is used in the inference stage. Additionally, for classes with low intra-class variances or inter-class correlations, the pushing force of the margin-pushing approach might be too weak to learn high-quality embeddings. To address these issues, we propose a novel Consistent Penalizing Field (CPF) Loss for zero-shot image retrieval. The proposed method has a single consistent penalizing field for all classes, resulting in similar decision boundaries across classes. By penalizing samples outside the penalizing field, CPF Loss can better utilize the information of samples with highly unbalanced intra-class and inter-class correlations, and improve the discriminative power of DML learning for zero-shot image retrieval. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging Shopee Product Matching dataset and other established benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/cloudlc/CPF.

ID CHALLENGES
AB In recent years, the frenetic advances of blockchain techniques have promoted the large-scale application of cryptocurrency and attracted significant attention in the mushrooming applications of decentralized finance (DeFi). To guarantee the health of a DeFi ecosystem, it is critical to reduce the transaction risks in a DeFi system. In particular, as a representative DeFi ecosystem platform, Ethereum's transaction process is mainly carried out with the help of smart contracts. Due to (pseudo)anonymity, the transaction process of Ethereum users is challenged by severe fraud threats. Ponzi scheme is the typical one. Previous studies have used machine learning methods to build Ponzi scheme detection models based on learning from the identified static smart contract samples feature data. However, in the early stage of smart contract deployment, the Ponzi scheme is difficult to detect. With the progress of transactions, Ponzi scheme will gradually show its characteristics. The existing methods are still falling short in capturing the temporal features of smart contracts for detecting Ponzi schemes in the big data environment. The recognition rate of the current approaches needs to be further improved. In this paper, we propose TTPS, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Ponzi scheme detection method considering time series transaction information of smart contracts. TTPS considers both temporal account features and code features of smart contracts. Adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) is employed to effectively extend the feature data of minority class Ponzi scheme small samples. LSTM is utilized to learn from the temporal feature data of Ponzi scheme samples for TTPS model training. Experimental results verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of TTPS.

AB Accurate solar irradiance forecasting with fine spatiotemporal correlations is essential for photovoltaic power generation. However, current spatiotemporal methods are unable to extract spatial features appropriately, leading to rough prediction results. Consequently, a deep graph neural network is proposed in this paper for multi-site solar irradiance forecasting. Self-adaptive adjacency matrices were developed to better capture the intrinsic influence between sites under different climate types at various time steps. Based on the adaptive graph convolution and long short-term memory network (AGCLSTM), the spatiotemporal features of each site were extracted to obtain prediction results for all the sites in the research area simultaneously. In the experiments conducted on the datasets of three climate types, the average root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (R) of the proposed model are observed to be in a range of 47.519-54.854 W/m2, 18.968-24.426 W/m2, and 0.9737-0.9889, respectively. Compared to the benchmark models, the average RMSE and MAE reduce by 1.31%-10.86% and 3.75%-18.57%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method proves to be effective for scenes of solar irradiance fluctuations with the help of self-adaptive adjacency matrices, which enhances its generalization ability and prediction accuracy for one-hour-ahead solar irradiance forecasting.

AB In large group decision-making, participators with different knowledge structures, backgrounds, and other characteristics are unlikely to accurately evaluate alternatives. For this, it is necessary to decompose alternatives into several elements, and consider the participators' preferences for elements of alternatives and the multiple classifications for participators according to their characteristics. However, related studies are still scarce. The objective of this paper is to propose a multi-elemental large group decision-making method, in which the desirable alternative(s) are selected from a set of feasible alternatives according to the preference information on multiple elements of alternatives provided by participators from multiple subgroups, and multiple classifications for participators are considered. In the method, according to the strict preference ordering of elements provided by participators, the percentage distributions on preferences of each subgroup concerning each element are firstly presented under each classification for participators. Secondly, the decision weight of each subgroup is determined by three factors, i.e., the consensus of preferences provided by each subgroup, the organizer's preference for each subgroup, and the number of participators in each subgroup. Then, the comprehensive preference concerning each element is determined by combing the preference information from multiple subgroups and the decision weights of multiple subgroups, the overall preference vector can be obtained under each classification, and the virtual alternatives are determined by normalizing the overall preference vector. Further, considering multiple classifications for participators, the overall dominant degrees of alternatives can be obtained by calculating the similarity degrees between each virtual alternative and each alternative, thus the ranking order of alternatives can be obtained based on the overall dominant degrees of alternatives. Finally, an example is given to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method. The results of the sensitivity and comparative analyses show that the proposed method is applicable and effective. The proposed method can further enrich and improve the theory and approach of large group decision-making with multiple elements considering multiple classifications for participators.

AB The development of the Internet and big data has led to the emergence of graphs as an important data representation structure in various real-world scenarios. However, as data size increases, computational complexity and memory requirements pose significant challenges for graph embedding. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multilevel embedding refinement framework (MERIT) based on large-scale graphs, using spectral distance-constrained graph coarsening algorithms and an improved graph convolutional neural network model that addresses the over-smoothing problem by incorporating initial values and identity mapping. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MERIT, with an average AUROC score 8% higher than other baseline methods. Moreover, in a node classification task on a large-scale graph with 126,825 nodes and 22,412,658 edges, the framework improves embedding quality while enhancing the runtime by 25 times. The experimental findings highlight the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach compared to other graph embedding methods.

AB In order to realize the intelligent energy management of the complex ship energy system, achieve the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goal and reduce the ship carbon emissions and ship operating costs, this paper proposes a distributed energy management method for ships entering and leaving ports based on polymorphic network considering computing power resources. Firstly, a polymorphic network-based energy management system for ships entering and leaving ports is proposed to enhance the information exchange between ship computing power, power and port power, simultaneously improve the communication quality and communication security among different modes. Secondly, in order to reduce the ship operating costs and port carbon emissions, the energy management model of ships entering and leaving ports is constructed considering computing power resources. Then, according to the ship's berthing and departing operation modes, this paper uses the distributed algorithm to solve the energy management problem, and explores the impact on the ship microgrid when the ship's data load changes. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB In recent years, various computational models have been proposed in neuroscience, but only a few have been utilized in robot visual navigation through engineering approaches. Besides, these engineering methods lack environmental adaptability, especially in the aspect of visual place recognition in weak or uncontrollable light fluctuations. To address this issue and enhance the performance of visual template matching and map loop closure detection in challenging lighting environments, this paper proposed a bionic visual navigation model that combines two neural network architectures, the Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) and Continuous Attractor Neural Network (CANN). In our navigation model, the visual features of the environments are encoded as temporal information by the spiking model and input into the local view cells for visual template matching. Additionally, we utilize the pose cells network, which incorporates the similarity between current and previous templates, along with odometry data, to encode spatial information and store it as an experience map. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conducted evaluations on datasets collected within our library, campus, and an open-source office dataset. The experimental results reveal that our algorithm increases the F1-score of template matching by approximately 10.5%, 35.8%, 61.7%, and 1.9% in each dataset, compared to the conventional RatSLAMmethod. Furthermore, our algorithm generates a more accurate map that closely correlates with the real-world trajectory without compromising on computation time. The results suggest that our bionic visual navigation model is reliable for both standard and extreme lighting conditions.

AB As restricted quantum computers become available, research focuses on finding meaningful applications. For example, in quantum machine learning, a special type of quantum circuit called a quantum neural network is one of the most investigated approaches. However, we know little about suitable circuit architectures or important model hyperparameters for a given task. In this work, we apply the functional ANOVA framework to the quantum neural network architectures to analyze which of the quantum machine learning hyperparameters are most influential for their predictive performance. We restrict our study to 7 open-source datasets from the OpenML-CC18 classification benchmark, which are small enough for simulations on quantum hardware with fewer than 20 qubits. Using this framework, three main levels of importance were identified, confirming expected patterns and revealing new insights. For instance, the learning rate is identified as the most important hyperparameter on all datasets, whereas the particular choice of entangling gates used is found to be the least important on all except for one dataset. In addition to identifying the relevant hyperparameters, for each of them, we also learned data-driven priors based on values that perform well on previously seen datasets, which can then be used to steer hyperparameter optimization processes. We utilize these priors in the hyperparameter optimization method hyperband and show that these improve performance against uniform sampling across all datasets by, on average, 0.53%, up to 6.11%, in cross-validation accuracy. We also demonstrate that such improvements hold on average regardless of the configuration hyperband is run with. Our work introduces new methodologies for studying quantum machine learning models toward quantum model selection in practice. All research code is made publicly available.

AB IntroductionWe introduce a bio-inspired navigation system for a robot to guide a social agent to a target location while avoiding static and dynamic obstacles. Robot navigation can be accomplished through a model of ring attractor neural networks. This connectivity pattern between neurons enables the generation of stable activity patterns that can represent continuous variables such as heading direction or position. The integration of sensory representation, decision-making, and motor control through ring attractor networks offers a biologically-inspired approach to navigation in complex environments.MethodsThe navigation system is divided into perception, planning, and control stages. Our approach is compared to the widely-used Social Force Model and Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star methods using the Social Individual Index and Relative Motion Index as metrics in simulated experiments. We created a virtual scenario of a pedestrian area with various obstacles and dynamic agents.ResultsThe results obtained in our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in guiding a social agent while avoiding obstacles, and the metrics used for evaluating the system indicate that our proposal outperforms the widely used Social Force Model.DiscussionOur approach points to improving safety and comfort specifically for human-robot interactions. By integrating the Social Individual Index and Relative Motion Index, this approach considers both social comfort and collision avoidance features, resulting in better human-robot interactions in a crowded environment.

   Fractional-order; Image segmentation
AB The two-dimensional (2D) Otsu algorithm used in image segmentation considers both the gray scale information of the image and the spatial information contained in the neighborhood of pixels. The algorithm is quite effective, but a number of variations have been proposed to improve its performance. In this paper, a new adaptive fractional-order (FO) genetic-particle swarm optimization (FOGPSO) version is proposed. The FOGPSO associates the particle selection operations of a genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Crossover and genetic mutation are used to avoid PSO falling into a local optimum. Fractional calculus operators are adopted in the updating scheme of velocity and position, while the order of the derivative is adaptively changed according to the state of the particles. Compared with the original PSO, the integer PSO, the fractional PSO (FOPSO), other improved versions of the PSO for Otsu algorithms, and other existing methods for 2D Otsu algorithms, the proposed method shows great superiority. Indeed, experimental results reveal that both qualitatively and quantitatively, through suitable indices, as the regional contrast, the intersection over union (IOU) and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), the FOGPSO outperforms the other methods, thus verifying the effectiveness of the new algorithm.

AB Recommender systems are commonly-used tools to assist people in making decisions. However, most research has focused on the domain of recommendations for audio-visual content and e-commerce, whereas the specific characteristics of recommendations for recipes and cooking did not receive enough attention. Since meals are often consumed in group (with friends or family), there is a need for group recommendations, taking into account the preferences of all group members. Also cuisine, allergies, disliked ingredients, diets, dish type, and required time to prepare are important factors for recipe selection. For 13 algorithms, we evaluated the recommendations for individuals and for groups using a dataset of recipe ratings. The best algorithm and a baseline algorithm based on popularity were selected for our mobile kitchen experience and recipe application, which assists users in the cooking process and provides recipe recommendations. Although significant differences between both algorithms were witnessed in the offline evaluation with the dataset, the differences were less noticeable in the online evaluation with real users. Because of the cold-start problem, the advanced algorithm failed to reach its full accuracy potential, but excelled in other quality features such as diversity, perceived usefulness, and confidence. We also witnessed a better evaluation (about half a star) of the recommendations by the more advanced cooks.

AB High utility pattern has received a lot of research and attention because of their wide range of application scenarios. How to efficiently mine high utility patterns over data streams has become an important issue in the field of data mining. To solve the problem that the traditional utility list structure has too many join operations and the join operation is not efficient, which leads to the low spatio-temporal efficiency of the algorithm and the problem that the sliding window model repeatedly generates the same resultset, a new algorithm for high utility pattern mining over data streams is proposed, named HUPM_Stream. A location-indexed list structure, Ext-list, is designed to reduce the time complexity of the utility list join operation, and an improved remaining utility pruning strategy IRS is proposed to reduce the number of utility list join operations, and a hash table structure-based resultset maintenance strategy HRS is designed to effectively reduce the search space of the algorithm and avoid repeatedly generating the same resultset during the sliding process of the window. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance on dense datasets.

AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) show excellent performance in various problems of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning, but require large amounts of data and huge computational resources. There is also the issue of unstable training. If the generator and discriminator diverge during the training process, the GAN is subsequently difficult to converge. In order to tackle these problems, various transfer learning methods have been introduced; however, mode collapse, which is a form of overfitting, often arises. Moreover, there were limitations in learning the distribution of the training data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the latest transfer learning methods as a solution to the problem, propose the most effective method of fixing some layers of the generator and discriminator, and discuss future prospects. The model to be used for the experiment is StyleGAN, and the performance evaluation uses Frechet Inception Distance (FID), coverage, and density. Results of the experiment revealed that the proposed method did not overfit. The model was able to learn the distribution of the training data relatively well compared to the previously proposed methods. Moreover, it outperformed existing methods at the Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, Oxford Flower, Caltech-256, CUB-200-2011, and Insect-30 datasets.

ID ENVIRONMENTAL SOUND CLASSIFICATION
AB Determining the source of aweak sound signal can be difficult, particularly in busy or noisy surroundings. The hand-engineered characteristics and algorithms used in traditional methods for source separation and localization are irresistible to changes in the signal or the noise. In environmental sound classification(ESC) the effectiveness of representative features collected from the environmental sounds is crucial to the classification performance. However, semantically meaningless frames and silent frames frequently hinder the performance of ESC. In order to address this problem, we proposed a new context-aware attention-based neural network for weak environmental sound source identification. Our method is based on the idea that the attention mechanism will be able to concentrate on important elements of the input signal and suppress irrelevant ones, enabling the network to locate the weak sound's source more effectively. To solve the limited capacity problem faced by the attention maps of the attention model we are using context information as additional input. The identification of weak signals and finding corresponding context information is also a challenging problem because of the degradation or noise in the signal. To solve this issue we proposed a novel algorithm based on MFCC for context feature generation. Additionally, the robustness and generalizability of the classification model are improved by using multiple feature extraction techniques which reduces the reliance on any single feature extraction technique. We test our methodology with experiments on datasets of simulated weak sound signals with varying amounts of noise and clutter. We evaluated the performance of our attention-based neural network in comparison to a number of established techniques. Our findings demonstrate that, especially in noisy and congested environments, the proposed model outperforms the baselines in terms of source identification accuracy. Overall, our work illustrates the efficiency of employing an attention-based neural network based on context information for the identification of weak sound sources and implies that this strategy may be a promising approach for further research in this area.

AB Dictionary learning is an effective feature learning method, leading to many remarkable results in data representation and classification tasks. However, dictionary learning is performed on the original data representation. In some cases, the capability of representation and discriminability of the learned dictionaries may need to be performed better, i.e., with only sparse but not low rank. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient data representation learning method by combining dictionary learning and self-representation, which utilizes both properties of sparsity in dictionary learning and low-rank in low-rank representation (LRR) simultaneously. Thus both the sparse and low-rank properties of the data representation can be naturally captured by our method. To obtain the solution of our proposed method effectively, we also innovatively introduce a more generalized data representation model in this paper. To our best knowledge, its closed-form solution is first derived analytically through our rigorous mathematical analysis. Experimental results show that our method not only can be used for data pre-processing but also can realize better dictionary learning. The samples in the same class can have similar representations by our method, and the discriminability of the learned dictionary can also be enhanced.

AB The person-job fit algorithm has become a crucial task in the online recruitment industry for matching resumes with suitable jobs and making recommendations. However, individuals' resumes and users' interaction records contain personal privacy information, which resumes and records cannot use in a public environment. This paper proposes a person-job fit framework with federated learning and privacy protection. It can utilize the user data stored locally on the user-side to train the model and ensure that the user's private data are not uploaded to the server-side. In addition, it prevents users' uploaded gradients from revealing private information by applying adaptive differential privacy techniques. However, federated learning suffers from a nonindependent homogeneous distribution of user data, which can lead to a user-side learned job representation with its own bias. Therefore, we introduce the idea of contrastive learning to guide user-side training to alleviate user-side bias and improve model performance. Experiments on real datasets show that our framework ensures higher performance while preserving user privacy data compared to typical person-job fit methods.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB 3D human motion prediction is one of the essential and challenging problems in computer vision, which has attracted extensive research attention in the past decades. Many previous methods sought to predict the motion state of the next moment using the traditional recurrent neural network in Euclidean space. However, most methods did not explicitly exploit the relationships or constraints between different body components, which carry crucial information for motion prediction. In addition, human motion representation in Euclidean space has high distortion and shows a weak semantic expression when using deep learning models. Based on these observations, we propose a novel Geometric Algebra-based Multiscale Encoder-Decoder network (GAMEDnet) to predict the future 3D poses. In the encoder, the core module is a novel multiscale Geometric Algebra-based multiscale feature extractor(GA-MFE) , which extracts motion features given the multiscale human motion graph. In the decoder, we propose a novel GA-Graph-based Gated Recurrent Unit (GAG-GRU) to sequentially produce predictions. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that the proposed GAMEDnet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both short and long-term motion prediction on the datasets of Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap.

TI Two-Stage Focus Measurement Network with Joint Boundary Refinement for

ID GUIDED FILTER
AB Focus measurement, one of the key tasks in multifocus image fusion (MFIF) frameworks, identifies the clearer parts of multifocus images pairs. Most of the existing methods aim to achieve disposable pixel-level focus measurement. However, the lack of sufficient accuracy often gives rise to misjudgments in the results. To this end, a novel two-stage focus measurement with joint boundary refinement network is proposed for MFIF. In this work, we adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy to gradually achieve block-level and pixel-level focus measurement for producing more fine-grained focus probability maps, instead of directly predicting at the pixel level. In addition, the joint boundary refinement optimizes the performance on the focused/defocused boundary component (FDB) during the focus measurement. To improve feature extraction capability, both CNN and transformer are employed to, respectively, encode local patterns and capture long-range dependencies. Then, the features from two input branches are legitimately aggregated by modeling the spatial complementary relationship in each pair of multifocus images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in both subjective perception and objective assessment.

AB Access control vulnerabilities that lead to elevated privileges are among the most dangerous vulnerabilities in Web applications. Most of the existing detection methods use dynamic or static analysis techniques alone, which suffer from high manual involvement, low automation, high leakage rate, low page coverage, and other deficiencies. To this end, this paper proposes a novel access control vulnerability detection method (DetAC) based on a sitemap model with global information representation. This method first constructs a static site-wide sitemap model based on the page link addresses in the Web application source code through static analysis techniques. After that, the application is logged in and executed dynamically with different role users. During this process, execution traces and request parameters are collected and converted into annotations to fill the corresponding edges of the static site-wide sitemap model. Then, the sitemap model with global information representation is obtained. This model can represent both the global control flow and data flow of the application. Then DetAC analyzes the role-based and user-based access control policies of the Web application based on the node reachability and annotated data features of the model. And according to the information such as role, user, and access resources, it generates attack vectors to achieve different roles and the same role of different users to access each other's resources. Finally, access control vulnerabilities are detected based on the equivalence of the results obtained using attack vector access and normal access to the Web application server. DetAC was validated on five real open-source Web applications, and the results showed that DetAC successfully detected up to 12 access control vulnerabilities, which are more than those of the traditional seven tools. The dynamic analysis page coverage rate was significantly improved during the detection process, reaching an average of 91.37%.

DE BERT; Interpretability; Attention; Stance classification
AB BERT produces state-of-the-art solutions for many natural language processing tasks at the cost of interpretability. As works discuss the value of BERT's attention weights to this purpose, we contribute to the field by examining this issue in the context of stance classification. We propose an interpretability framework to identify the most influential words for correctly predicting stances using BERT models. Unlike related work, we develop a broader level of interpretability focused on the overall model behaviour, aggregating tokens' attentions into words' attention weights that can be semantically related to the domain and proposing metrics to measure words relevance in correct predictions. We developed a broad experimental setting to analyse the premises underlying our framework regarding word attention scores and the capability concerning interpretability, adopting three case studies of stances expressed on Twitter on issues about the pandemic, and four pre-trained BERT models. We concluded that our method is not affected by the characteristics of BERT-models vocabularies, that words with high absolute attention have a higher probability of positive influence on correct classification, and that the influential words represent the domains. We observed many common words compared to a baseline method, but the words yielded by our method were considered more relevant according to a qualitative assessment.

AB The interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (IVq-ROFSs), considered as a new useful decision tool, possess a great ability to handle uncertain or vague knowledge in practical decision-making (DM). This paper introduces a novel IVq-ROF superiority and inferiority (IVq-ROF-SIR) technique combining with sine-trigonometric operational laws (STOLs). The proposed SIR method utilizes two kinds of information, the superiority and the inferiority information, to obtain two types of flows, including the superiority and the inferiority flows. Then, these flows are utilized to rank the set of alternatives partially or completely. Using sine-trigonometric functions and the flexibility of IVq-ROFSs, novel STOLs have been created. Further, we conduct a case study of green supplier selection (GSS) to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the developed technique. The main contributions of this article are as follows: (1) The aggregation operators for interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers and their characteristics have been studied under sine-trigonometric functions. (2) The SIR approach has been developed under IVq-ROFSs. The proposed technique is explained through an Algorithm as well as a flowchart. (3) Then, a case study of GSS is considered to apply the developed technique. (4) The results obtained have been compared with the ranking obtained through various existing techniques, including IVq-ROF TOPSIS method.

AB Eye tracking technologies have frequently been used in sport research to understand the interrelations between gaze behavior and performance, using a paradigm known as vision-for-action. This methodology has not been robustly applied within the field of interface design. The present work demonstrates the benefit of employing a vision-for-action paradigm for interface evaluation. This is demonstrated through the evaluation of a novel task-specific symbology set presented on a head-up-display (HUD), developed to support pilots conduct ground operations in low-visibility conditions. HUD gaze behavior was correlated with task performance to determine whether certain combinations of gaze behavior could produce effective predictive performance models. A human-in-the-loop experiment was conducted with 11 professional pilots who were required to taxi in a fixed-base flight simulator using the HUD symbology, while gaze data toward the different HUD symbology elements was collected. Performance was measured as centerline deviation error and taxiing speed. Results revealed that appropriately timed gaze behavior toward task-specific elements of the HUD were associated with superior performance. During turns, attention toward an undercarriage lateral position indicator was associated with reduced centerline deviation (p < 0.05). The findings are interpreted alongside detailed posttrial user-feedback of the HUD symbology to illustrate how eye tracking methodologies can be incorporated into interface usability evaluations. The joint interpretation of these data demonstrates these novel procedures, the findings contribute to enhancing the wider domain of interface design evaluation.

TI STFT: Spatial and temporal feature fusion for transformer tracker
SO IET COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE computer vision; image processing
AB Siamese-based trackers have demonstrated robust performance in object tracking, while Transformers have achieved widespread success in object detection. Currently, many researchers use a hybrid structure of convolutional neural networks and Transformers to design the backbone network of trackers, aiming to improve performance. However, this approach often underutilises the global feature extraction capability of Transformers. The authors propose a novel Transformer-based tracker that fuses spatial and temporal features. The tracker consists of a multilayer spatial feature fusion network (MSFFN), a temporal feature fusion network (TFFN), and a prediction head. The MSFFN includes two phases: feature extraction and feature fusion, and both phases are constructed with a Transformer. Compared with the hybrid structure of "CNNs + Transformer," the proposed method enhances the continuity of feature extraction and the ability of information interaction between features, enabling comprehensive feature extraction. Moreover, to consider the temporal dimension, the authors propose a TFFN for updating the template image. The network utilises the Transformer to fuse the tracking results of multiple frames with the initial frame, allowing the template image to continuously incorporate more information and maintain the accuracy of target features. Extensive experiments show that the tracker STFT achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks (OTB100, VOT2018, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and UAV123). Especially, the tracker STFT achieves remarkable area under the curve score of 0.652 and 0.706 on the LaSOT and OTB100 benchmark respectively.
   The authors are committed to novel approaches to solving the obscuration problem in target tracking. A full transformer tracker with state-of-the-art results in multiple benchmark datasets is proposed.image

AB Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a problem that involves finding a set of non-conflicting paths for a set of agents confined to a graph. In this work, we study a MAPF setting, where the environment is only partially observable for each agent, i.e., an agent observes the obstacles and other agents only within a limited field-of-view. Moreover, we assume that the agents do not communicate and do not share knowledge on their goals, intended actions, etc. The task is to construct a policy that maps the agent's observations to actions. Our contribution is multifold. First, we propose two novel policies for solving partially observable MAPF (PO-MAPF): one based on heuristic search and another one based on reinforcement learning (RL). Next, we introduce a mixed policy that is based on switching between the two. We suggest three different switch scenarios: the heuristic, the deterministic, and the learnable one. A thorough empirical evaluation of all the proposed policies in a variety of setups shows that the mixing policy demonstrates the best performance is able to generalize well to the unseen maps and problem instances, and, additionally, outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts (Primal2 and PICO). The source-code is available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/when-to-switch.

ID INTELLIGENCE
AB Traditional spiking learning algorithm aims to train neurons to spike at a specific time or on a particular frequency, which requires precise time and frequency labels in the training process. While in reality, usually only aggregated labels of sequential patterns are provided. The aggregate-label (AL) learning is proposed to discover these predictive features in distracting background streams only by aggregated spikes. It has achieved much success recently, but it is still computationally intensive and has limited use in deep networks. To address these issues, we propose an event-driven spiking aggregate learning algorithm (SALA) in this article. Specifically, to reduce the computational complexity, we improve the conventional spike-threshold-surface (STS) calculation in AL learning by analytical calculating voltage peak values in spiking neurons. Then we derive the algorithm to multilayers by event-driven strategy using aggregated spikes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks including temporal clue recognition, segmented and continuous speech recognition, and neuromorphic image classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the new STS method improves the efficiency of AL learning significantly, and the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional spiking algorithm in various temporal clue recognition tasks.

AB We present a novel method for underwater image restoration, which combines a Comprehensive Imaging Formation Model with prior knowledge and unsupervised techniques. Our approach has two main components: depth map estimation using a Channel Intensity Prior (CIP) and backscatter elimination through Adaptive Dark Pixels (ADP). The CIP effectively mitigates issues caused by solid-colored objects and highlighted regions in underwater scenarios. The ADP, utilizing a dynamic depth conversion, addresses issues associated with narrow depth ranges and backscatter. Furthermore, an unsupervised method is employed to enhance the accuracy of monocular depth estimation and reduce artificial illumination influence. The final output is refined via color compensation and a blue-green channel color balance factor, delivering artifact-free images. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficacy in dealing with uneven lighting and diverse underwater environments.

AB Three approximation regions, namely positive region, negative region, and boundary region are fundamental concepts in rough set theory. How to calculate three approximation regions effectively is a crucial issue. Granular computing emphasizes solving a complex problem at multiple levels of granularity or abstraction, which can simplify the problem solving. Based on granular computing, we propose a hierarchical algorithm to calculate three approximation regions, which is fast and cost-sensitive. First, we construct three knowledge representation levels. Second, based on three knowledge representation levels, we calculate three approximation regions hierarchically. Considering the dynamic variation of objects is very common in real applications, we propose incremental hierarchical algorithms to calculate three approximation regions dynamically. At a high level of knowledge representation levels with coarse granularity, the proposed hierarchical algorithms can obtain inaccurate results with high efficiency and low cost. At a low level of knowledge representation levels with fine granularity, the proposed hierarchical algorithms can obtain accurate results with low efficiency and high cost. From high level to low level, we calculate three approximation regions hierarchically, reducing the computational complexity and cost. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB The application of reinforcement learning in mobile robotics faces the challenges of real-world physical environments, in contrast to playground setups like video games. In a mobile robot motion control, it is not always possible to perform episodes of pre-training in large amounts due to time, resource limitations or other concerns. Control methods that rely on a prior explicit map may be impractical or even impossible to use for new dynamic environments. In this paper, we present a method of local navigation approach for driving a robot to a desired position without relying on an explicit map of the environment. Only the laser scan measurements were used to determine the obstacles. We focus in this work on online methods of reinforcement learning which do not require running the robot in full episodes until success or failure. However, the price for such an online capability is that some model knowledge about the environment has to be utilized. Here, we propose an algorithm called stacked Q-learning, which unifies aspects of standard reinforcement learning techniques with model-based predictive agents. We compare this algorithm to a classical model predictive controller. The comparison focuses on the accumulated cost of parking the robot avoiding obstacles. The results look promising as the stacked Q-learning beat its counterpart, model predictive control, yet being of the same computational complexity. The suggested agent design of stacked Q-learning can thus be taken as a foundation for a class of predictive reinforcement learning methods.

AB Cellular Automata have successfully been successfully applied to the modeling and simulation of pedestrian and crowd dynamics. In particular, the investigated scenarios have often been focused on the evaluation of medium-high population density situations, in which the motivation of pedestrians to reach a certain location overcomes their tendency to naturally respect proxemic distances. The global COVID-19 outbreak, though, has shown that sometimes it is crucial to contemplate how proxemic tendencies are emphasized and amplified by the affective state of the individuals involved in the scenario, representing an important factor to take into consideration when investigating the behaviour of a crowd. In this paper we present a research effort aimed at integrating results of quantitative analyses regarding the effects of affective states on the perception of distances maintained by different types of pedestrians with the modeling of pedestrian movement choices in a cellular automata framework.

AB In this article, we propose a self-supervised learning solution for human activity recognition with smartphone accelerometer data. We aim to develop a model that learns strong representations from accelerometer signals, in order to perform robust human activity classification, while reducing the model's reliance on class labels. Specifically, we intend to enable cross-dataset transfer learning such that our network pretrained on a particular dataset can perform effective activity classification on other datasets (successive to a small amount of fine-tuning). To tackle this problem, we design our solution with the intention of learning as much information from the accelerometer signals as possible. As a result, we design two separate pipelines, one that learns the data in time-frequency domain, and the other in time-domain alone. In order to address the issues mentioned above in regards to cross-dataset transfer learning, we use self-supervised contrastive learning to train each of these streams. Next, each stream is fine-tuned for final classification, and eventually the two are fused to provide the final results. We evaluate the performance of the proposed solution on three datasets, namely, MotionSense, human activities and postural transitions data (HAPT), and heterogeneity human activity recognition (HHAR), and demonstrate that our solution outperforms prior works in this field achieving F1 scores 0.934, 0.911, and 0.826, respectively. We further evaluate the performance of the method in learning generalized features, by using MobiAct dataset for pretraining and the remaining three datasets for the downstream classification task, and show that the proposed solution achieves better performance in comparison with other self-supervised methods in cross-dataset transfer learning.

ID TIME-SERIES
AB Short-term load forecasting (STLF) is challenging due to complex time series (TS) which express three seasonal patterns and a nonlinear trend. This article proposes a novel hybrid hierarchical deep-learning (DL) model that deals with multiple seasonality and produces both point forecasts and predictive intervals (PIs). It combines exponential smoothing (ES) and a recurrent neural network (RNN). ES extracts dynamically the main components of each individual TS and enables on-the-fly deseasonalization, which is particularly useful when operating on a relatively small dataset. A multilayer RNN is equipped with a new type of dilated recurrent cell designed to efficiently model both short and long-term dependencies in TS. To improve the internal TS representation and thus the model's performance, RNN learns simultaneously both the ES parameters and the main mapping function transforming inputs into forecasts. We compare our approach against several baseline methods, including classical statistical methods and machine learning (ML) approaches, on STLF problems for 35 European countries. The empirical study clearly shows that the proposed model has high expressive power to solve nonlinear stochastic forecasting problems with TS including multiple seasonality and significant random fluctuations. In fact, it outperforms both statistical and state-of-the-art ML models in terms of accuracy.

ID MODEL
AB Multitask learning uses external knowledge to improve internal clustering and single-task learning. Existing multitask learning algorithms mostly use shallow-level correlation to aid judgment, and the boundary factors on high-dimensional datasets often lead algorithms to poor performance. The initial parameters of these algorithms cause the border samples to fall into a local optimal solution. In this study, a multitask-guided deep clustering (DC) with boundary adaptation (MTDC-BA) based on a convolutional neural network autoencoder (CNN AE) is proposed. In the first stage, dubbed multitask pretraining (M-train), we construct an autoencoder (AE) named CNN-AE using the DenseNet-like structure, which performs deep feature extraction and stores captured multitask knowledge into model parameters. In the second phase, the parameters of the M-train are shared for CNN-AE, and clustering results are obtained by deep features, which is termed as single-task fitting (S-fit). To eliminate the boundary effect, we use data augmentation and improved self-paced learning to construct the boundary adaptation. We integrate boundary adaptors into the M-train and S-fit stages appropriately. The interpretability of MTDC-BA is accomplished by data transformation. The model relies on the principle that features become important as the reconfiguration loss decreases. Experiments on a series of typical datasets confirm the performance of the proposed MTDC-BA. Compared with other traditional clustering methods, including single-task DC algorithms and the latest multitask clustering algorithms, our MTDC-BA achieves better clustering performance with higher computational efficiency. Deep features clustering results demonstrate the stability of MTDC-BA by visualization and convergence verification. Through the visualization experiment, we explain and analyze the whole model data input and the middle characteristic layer. Further understanding of the principle of MTDC-BA. Through additional experiments, we know that the proposed MTDC-BA is efficient in the use of multitask knowledge. Finally, we carry out sensitivity experiments on the hyper-parameters to verify their optimal performance.

AB This work studies the security of consensus-based distributed filtering under the replay attack, which can freely select a part of sensors and modify their measurements into previously recorded ones. We analyze the performance degradation of distributed estimation caused by the replay attack, and utilize the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence to quantify the attack stealthiness. Specifically, for a stable system, we prove that under any replay attack, the estimation error is not only bounded, but also can re-enter the steady state. In that case, we prove that the replay attack is ? -stealthy, where ? can be calculated based on two Lyapunov equations. On the other hand, for an unstable system, we prove that the trace of estimation error covariance is lower bounded by an exponential function, which indicates that the estimation error may diverge due to the attack. In view of this, we provide a sufficient condition to ensure that any replay attack is detectable. Furthermore, we analyze the case that the adversary starts to attack only if the current measurement is close to a previously recorded one. Finally, we verify the theoretical results via several numerical simulations.

AB Irregularly, asynchronously and sparsely sampled multivariate time series (IASS-MTS) are characterized by sparse and uneven time intervals and nonsynchronous sampling rates, posing significant challenges for machine learning models to learn complex relationships within and beyond IASS-MTS to support various inference tasks. The existing methods typically either focus solely on single-task forecasting or simply concatenate them through a separate preprocessing imputation procedure for the subsequent classification application. However, these methods often ignore valuable annotated labels or fail to discover meaningful patterns from unlabeled data. Moreover, the approach of separate prefilling may introduce errors due to the noise in raw records, and thus degrade the downstream prediction performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the time-aware dual attention and memory-augmented network (DAMA) with stochastic generative imputation (SGI). Our model constructs a joint task learning architecture that unifies imputation and classification tasks collaboratively. First, we design a new time-aware DAMA that accounts for irregular sampling rates, inherent data nonalignment, and sparse values in IASS-MTS data. The proposed network integrates both attention and memory to effectively analyze complex interactions within and across IASS-MTS for the classification task. Second, we develop the stochastic generative imputation (SGI) network that uses auxiliary information from sequence data for inferring the time series missing observations. By balancing joint tasks, our model facilitates interaction between them, leading to improved performance on both classification and imputation tasks. Third, we evaluate our model on real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of imputation accuracy and classification results, outperforming the baselines.

AB Federated learning (FL) has been an effective way to train a machine learning model distributedly, holding local data without exchanging them. However, due to the inaccessibility of local data, FL with label noise would be more challenging. Most existing methods assume only open-set or closed-set noise and correspondingly propose filtering or correction solutions, ignoring that label noise can be mixed in real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel FL method to discriminate the type of noise and make the FL mixed noise-robust, named FedMIN. FedMIN employs a composite framework that captures local-global differences in multiparticipant distributions to model generalized noise patterns. By determining adaptive thresholds for identifying mixed label noise in each client and assigning appropriate weights during model aggregation, FedMIN enhances the performance of the global model. Furthermore, FedMIN incorporates a loss alignment mechanism using local and global Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to mitigate the risk of revealing samplewise loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets, which include the simulated FL testbeds, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, and the real-world ones, i.e., Camelyon17 and multiorgan nuclei challenge (MoNuSAC). Compared to FL benchmarks, FedMIN improves model accuracy by up to 9.9% due to its superior noise estimation capabilities.

AB In the era of the Internet, information data continue to accumulate, and the explosive growth of network information explosion leads to the reduction of the accuracy of users' access to information. To enhance the user experience and purchasing desire of e-commerce users, a e-commerce user recommendation algorithm based on social relationship characteristics and improved K-means algorithm is proposed. It combines the Automatic Time Division Dynamic Topic Model based on adaptive time slice division for building a strength calculation model in view of the characteristics of social relations. Then, it proposes an e-commerce user recommendation algorithm in view of the improved K-means algorithm to improve the accuracy of topic feature extraction and user recommendation. The experiment illustrates that there is no fluctuation in the clustering function of the improved K-means algorithm, and the highest, lowest, and average accuracy remain consistent under the three datasets, with average accuracy of 78.9%, 84.5%, and 95.9%, respectively. The community discovery-based friend recommendation algorithm presented in the study has the highest accuracy, illustrating that improving the K-means algorithm can further improve recommendation accuracy. The accuracy of the feature extraction method in view of alternative cost is 0.63, which improves the accuracy by about 9%. The results indicate that this study can provide technical support for user recommendations on e-commerce platforms.

AB Supplier selection is a critical decision-making process for any organization, as it directly impacts the quality, cost, and reliability of its products and services. However, the supplier selection problem can become highly complex due to the uncertainties and vagueness associated with it. To overcome these complexities, multi-criteria decision analysis, and fuzzy logic have been used to incorporate uncertainties and vagueness into the supplier selection process. These techniques can help organizations make informed decisions and mitigate the risks associated with supplier selection. In this article, a complex picture fuzzy soft set (cpFSS), a generalized fuzzy set-like structure, is developed to deal with information-based uncertainties involved in the supplier selection process. It can maintain the expected information-based periodicity by introducing amplitude and phase terms. The amplitude term is meant for fuzzy membership, and the phase term is for managing its periodicity within the complex plane. The cpFSS also facilitates the decision-makers by allowing them the opportunity to provide their neutral grade-based opinions for objects under observation. Firstly, the essential notions and set-theoretic operations of cpFSS are investigated and illustrated with examples. Secondly, a MADM-based algorithm is proposed by describing new matrix-based aggregations of cpFSS like the core matrix, maximum and minimum decision value matrices, and score. Lastly, the proposed algorithm is implemented in real-world applications with the aim of selecting a suitable supplier for the provision of required materials for construction projects. With the sensitivity analysis of score values through Pythagorean means, it can be concluded that the results and rankings of the suppliers are consistent. Moreover, through structural comparison, the proposed structure is proven to be more flexible and reliable as compared to existing fuzzy set-like structures.

AB The content of music is not always suitable for all ages. Industries that manage music content are looking for ways to help adults determine what is appropriate for children. Lyrics of songs have become increasingly inappropriate for kids and can negatively impact their mental development. However, it is difficult to filter explicit musical content because it is mostly done manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Existing approaches lack the desired accuracy and are complex. This study suggests using a combination of machine learning and deep learning models to automatically screen song lyrics in this regard. The proposed model, called ELSTM-VC, combines extra tree classifier and long short-term memory and its performance is compared to other models. The ELSTM-VC can detect explicit content in English lyrics and can be useful for the music industry. The study used a dataset of 100 songs from Spotify for training, and the results show that the proposed approach effectively detects explicit lyrics. It can censor offensive content for children with a 96% accuracy. The performance of the proposed approach is better than existing approaches including machine learning models and encoding-decoding models.

AB Buildings, which play an important role in the daily lives of humans, are a significant indicator of urban development. Currently, automatic building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images (RSI) has become an important means in urban studies, such as urban sprawl, urban planning, urban heat island effect, population estimation and damage evaluation. In this article, we propose a building extraction method that combines bottom-up RSI low-level feature extraction with top-down guidance from prior knowledge. In high-resolution RSI, buildings usually have high intensity, strong edges and clear textures. To generate primary features, we propose a feature space transform method that consider building. We propose an object oriented method for high-resolution RSI shadow extraction. Our method achieves user accuracy and producer accuracy above 95% for the extraction results of the experimental images. The overall accuracy is above 97%, and the quantity error is below 1%. Compared with the traditional method, our method has better performance on all the indicators, and the experiments prove the effectiveness of the method.

AB Photometric stereo methods typically rely on RGB cameras and are usually performed in a dark room to avoid ambient illumination. Ambient illumination poses a great challenge in photometric stereo due to the restricted dynamic range of the RGB cameras. To address this limitation, we present a novel method, namely Event Fusion Photometric Stereo Network (EFPS-Net), which estimates the surface normals of an object in an ambient light environment by utilizing a deep fusion of RGB and event cameras. The high dynamic range of event cameras provides a broader perspective of light representations that RGB cameras cannot provide. Specifically, we propose an event interpolation method to obtain ample light information, which enables precise estimation of the surface normals of an object. By using RGB-event fused observation maps, our EFPS-Net outperforms previous state -of-the-art methods that depend only on RGB frames, resulting in a 7.94% reduction in mean average error. In addition, we curate a novel photometric stereo dataset by capturing objects with RGB and event cameras under numerous ambient light environments.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Graph neural network; Fairness; Link prediction
AB The rise of graph representation learning as the primary solution for many different network science tasks led to a surge of interest in the fairness of this family of methods. Link prediction, in particular, has a substantial social impact. However, link prediction algorithms tend to increase the segregation in social networks by disfavouring the links between individuals in specific demographic groups. This paper proposes a novel way to enforce fairness on graph neural networks with a fine-tuning strategy. We Drop the unfair Edges and, simultaneously, we Adapt the model's parameters to those modifications, DEA in short. We introduce two covariance-based constraints designed explicitly for the link prediction task. We use these constraints to guide the optimization process responsible for learning the new 'fair' adjacency matrix. One novelty of DEA is that we can use a discrete yet learnable adjacency matrix in our fine-tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on five real-world datasets and show that we can improve both the accuracy and the fairness of the link prediction tasks. In addition, we present an in-depth ablation study demonstrating that our training algorithm for the adjacency matrix can be used to improve link prediction performances during training.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) use in automated Electrocardiogram (ECG) classification has continuously attracted the research community's interest, motivated by their promising results. Despite their great promise, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of their results, which is a key element for their implementation in clinical practice. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a critical for trustworthy and reliable AI, particularly in safety-critical domains such as medicine. Estimating uncertainty in Machine Learning (ML) model predictions has been extensively used for Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under single-label tasks. However, the use of UQ methods in multi-label classification remains underexplored. This study goes beyond developing highly accurate models comparing five uncertainty quantification methods using the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture across various validation scenarios, including internal and external validation as well as OOD detection, taking multi-label ECG classification as the example domain. We show the importance of external validation and its impact on classification performance, uncer-tainty estimates quality, and calibration. Ensemble-based methods yield more robust uncertainty estimations than single network or stochastic methods. Although current methods still have limitations in accurately quantifying uncertainty, particularly in the case of dataset shift, incorporating uncertainty estimates with a classification with a rejection option improves the ability to detect such changes. Moreover, we show that using uncertainty estimates as a criterion for sample selection in active learning setting results in greater improvements in classification performance compared to random sampling.

ID MAXIMIZATION
AB Heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) models, capable of learning low-dimensional dense vectors from heterogeneous graphs for downstream graph-mining tasks, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. For these models, metapath-based methods have been widely adopted. However, most existing metapath-based HGNN models either discard intermediate nodes within a metapath, resulting in information loss, or indiscriminately aggregate information along a metapath containing different types of nodes, resulting in unavoidable learning bias. To overcome these limitations, a new HGNN model named HMSG, is proposed in this paper to comprehensively capture structural, semantic and attribute information from both homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors more purposefully. To achieve this, a type-specific linear transformation is first applied to transfer the node attributes to different types of nodes with the same latent factor space. In the new model, the heterogeneous graph is decomposed into multiple metapath-based homogeneous and heterogeneous subgraphs where each subgraph associates specific semantic and structural information; this is different from existing models, which mainly rely on symmetric metapaths. Subsequently, tailored attention-based message aggregation methods are independently applied to each subgraph such that information learning can be more targeted. Finally, information from different subgraphs is fused through graph-level attention to obtain a complete representation. The learned representations are evaluated by several graph-mining tasks. Results indicate that the HMSG attains the best performance in all evaluation metrics than state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the modules designed for the HMSG. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drug-drug interactions (DDI) may lead to unexpected side effects, which is a growing concern in both academia and industry. Many DDIs have been reported, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Predicting and understanding DDIs can help researchers to improve drug safety and protect patient health. Here, we introduce DDI-GCN, a method that utilizes graph convolutional networks (GCN) to predict DDIs based on chemical structures. We demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on the independent hold-out set. It can also provide visualization of structural features associated with DDIs, which can help us to study the underlying mechanisms. To make it easy and accessible to use, we developed a web server for DDI-GCN, which is freely available at http://wengzq-lab.cn/ddi/.

AB Recently, deep clustering has been extensively employed for various data mining tasks, and it can be divided into auto-encoder (AE)-based and graph neural networks (GNN)-based methods. However, existing AE-based methods fall short in effectively extracting structural information, while GNN suffer from smoothing and heterophily. Although methods that combine AE and GNN achieve impressive performance, there remains an inadequate balance between preserving the raw structure and exploring the underlying structure. Accordingly, we propose a novel network named Structure-Aware Deep Clustering network (SADC). Firstly, we compute the cumulative influence of non-adjacent nodes at multiple depths and, thus, enhance the adjacency matrix. Secondly, an enhanced graph auto-encoder is designed. Thirdly, the latent space of AE is endowed with the ability to perceive the raw structure during the learning process. Besides, we design self-supervised mechanisms to achieve co-optimization of node representation learning and topology learning. A new loss function is designed to preserve the inherent structure while also allowing for exploration of latent data structure. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-view learning for classification has achieved a remarkable performance compared with the single-view based methods. Inspired by the instance based learning which directly regards the instance as the prior and well preserves the valuable information in different instances, a Multi-view Instance Attention Fusion Network (MvIAFN) is proposed to efficiently exploit the correlation across both instances and views. Specifically, a small number of instances from different views are first sampled as the set of templates. Given an additional instance and based on the similarities between it and the selected templates, it can be re-presented by following an attention strategy. Thanks for this strategy, the given instance is capable of preserving the additional information from the selected instances, achieving the purpose of extracting the instance-correlation. Additionally, for each sample, we not only perform the instance attention in each single view but also get the attention across multiple views, allowing us to further fuse them to obtain the fused attention for each view. Experimental results on datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-arts.

   Prompting template engineering; Answer engineering
AB Linguistic metonymy is a common type of figurative language in natural language processing (NLP), where a concept is represented by a closely associated word or phrase, for example "business executives suits". As a result, metonymy resolution has become an important NLP task aimed at correctly identifying metonymic expressions within sentences. Previous approaches to this task have typically relied on pre-trained language models (PLMs) using a fine-tuning process. However, this can be timeconsuming and resource-intensive, and may lead to a loss of factual prior knowledge. The emergence of a novel learning paradigm termed "prompt learning"or "prompt-tuning"has recently sparked widespread interest and captured considerable attention, as it has proven to yield remarkable results and surpass previous benchmarks. This approach uses a "pre-train -> prompt -> predict"paradigm and has been shown to better utilize the internal prior knowledge of a PLM, especially in situations with limited supervised resources. Inspired by this success, we investigated how prompt learning could improve metonymy resolution. We have developed a series of prompt learning approaches, called PromptMR, for metonymy resolution, and applied them to several widely-used metonymy resolution datasets. We also designed additional prompt-tuning augmentation strategies to further enhance the potential of prompt learning. Our experiments demonstrated that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance over multiple competitive baselines in both data-sufficient and data-scarce scenarios. The code implementations for PromptMR are accessible on GitHub via the URL: https://github.com/albert-jin/PromptTuning2MetonymyResolution. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-label Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) is more reasonable and realistic than standard single-label ZSL because several objects can co-exist in a natural image in real scenarios. Intra-class feature entanglement is a significant factor influencing the alignment of visual and semantic features, resulting in the model's inability to recognize unseen samples comprehensively and completely. We observe that existing multi-label ZSL methods place a greater emphasis on attention-based refinement and decoupling of visual features, while ignoring the relationship between label semantics. Relying on label correlations to solve multi-label ZSL tasks has not been deeply studied. In this paper, we make full use of the co-occurrence relationship between category labels and build a directed weighted semantic graph based on statistics and prior knowledge, in which node features represent category semantics and weighted edges represent conditional probabilities of label co-occurrence. To guide the targeted extraction of visual features, node features and edge set weights are simultaneously updated and refined, and embedded into the visual feature extraction network from a global and local perspective. The proposed method's effectiveness was demonstrated by simulation results on two challenging multi-label ZSL benchmarks: NUS-WIDE and Open Images. In comparison to stateof-the-art models, our model achieves an absolute gain of 2.4% mAP on NUS-WIDE and 2.1% mAP on Open Images respectively.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing attention is paid to ethical issues and values when designing and deploying artificial intelligence (AI). However, we do not know how those values are embedded in artificial artefacts or how relevant they are to the population exposed to and interacting with AI applications. Based on literature engaging with ethical principles and moral values in AI, we designed an original survey instrument, including 15 value components, to estimate the importance of these values to people in the general population. The article is based on representative surveys conducted in Estonia, Germany, and Sweden (n = 4501), which have varying experiences with implementing AI. The factor analysis showed four underlying dimensions of values embedded in the design and use of AI: (1) protection of personal interests to ensure social benefit, (2) general monitoring to ensure universal solidarity, (3) ensuring social diversity and social sustainability, and (4) efficiency. We found that value types can be ordered along the two dimensions of resources and change. The comparison between countries revealed that some dimensions, like social diversity and sustainability evaluations, are more universally valued among individuals, countries, and domains. Based on our analysis, we suggest a need and a framework for developing basic values in AI.

AB Multi-domain model catalogs serve as empirical sources of knowledge and insights about specific domains, about the use of a modeling language's constructs, as well as about the patterns and anti-patterns recurrent in the models of that language crosscutting different domains. They may support domain and language learning, model reuse, knowledge discovery for humans, and reliable automated processing and analysis if built following generally accepted quality requirements for scientific data management. More specifically, not unlike scientific (meta)data, models should be shared according to the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability). In this paper, we report on the construction of a FAIR model catalog for Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling research, a trending paradigm lying at the intersection of conceptual modeling and ontology engineering in which the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and OntoUML emerged among the most adopted technologies. The catalog, publicly available at https://w3id.org/ontouml-models, currently includes over one hundred and forty models, developed in a variety of contexts and domains.

AB Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) influences the Chinese and global medical systems, with its quality essential to its effectiveness. The origin of TCM material impacts the quality of the same TCM materials. However, the existing origin classification methods of the same TCM materials from different places mainly have two disadvantages: slow processing speed and extensive experience. To address these issues, a fast and real-time technology, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), is introduced into our solution. We propose a TCM classification system that combines one-dimensional LIBS spectra with two-dimensional images. This dual-modality fusion approach represents a significant advancement in multi-view data analysis for TCM classification. As a case study, we focus on wolfberry and construct a new dataset comprising 10,800 pairs of LIBS spectrum and image data to fill the gap. To achieve superior multiple feature fusion, a two-stage fusion network (TFNet) in a coarse-to-fine way is proposed. In the first coarse fusion, the Depth Attention Fusion (DAF) module is applied to extract the key features of stacked spectrum and image. In the second fine fusion, the Line to Area (LTA) module entirely focuses on and highlights the critical spectral line features. Experimental accuracy is over 0.99 with less computation and parameters, indicating the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed TFNet. Therefore, the classification system achieves exceptional accuracy and efficiency due to its simple sample preparation, real-time data collection and the high-accuracy lightweight network.

AB Accurate diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders is a challenging task due to the time-consuming cognitive tests and potential human bias in clinics. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adversarial self -supervised graph neural network (GNN) based on graph contrastive learning, named A-GCL, for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Taking advantage of the success of GNNs in psychiatric disease diagnosis using fMRI, our proposed A-GCL model is expected to improve the performance of diagnosis and provide more robust results. A-GCL takes graphs constructed from the fMRI images as input and uses contrastive learning to extract features for classification. The graphs are constructed with 3 bands of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as node features and Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCC) of the average fMRI time series in different brain regions as edge weights. The contrastive learning creates an edge-dropped graph from a trainable Bernoulli mask to extract features that are invariant to small variations of the graph. Experiment results on three datasets - Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) I, ABIDE II, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - with 3 atlases - AAL1, AAL3, Shen268 - demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of A-GCL compared to the other GNN-based models. Extensive ablation studies verify the robustness of the proposed approach to atlas selection and model variation. Explanatory results reveal key functional connections and brain regions associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB Recent advances in manufacturing technologies witness the digital transformation of traditional manufacturing systems. Digital Twin is one technology being studied and applied in various aspects of production. Reconfigurable Manufacturing System (RMS), as an advanced manufacturing paradigm, proposes new challenges for Digital Twin application. More flexibility is required for Digital Twin to adapt to the dynamic rearrangement of RMS, supporting the full lifecycle of the systems. But how this can be achieved is yet to be explored. Against the background, this paper aims to realise Digital Twin-driven RMS reconfiguration. By integrating and clarifying the prerequisites of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and Manufacturing Execution System (MES), Digital Twin Monitoring and Simulation Integrated Platform (DTMSIP) is proposed for RMS. With transparent communication and decoupled structure, DTMSIP can perform real-time online supervision and high-fidelity offline simulation of the production of RMS. Accordingly, the method of implementing DTMSIP is introduced by building Digital Twin mapping based on Twinning Entity (TE). Moreover, how the CPS-MES-DTMSIP architecture serves the RMS evolution is discussed by proposing the procedure of DTMSIP-driven RMS reconfiguration. To validate the proposed procedure, DTMSIP software is realised for an existing RMS using Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). Through DTMSIP monitoring and simulation of planned RMS configurations, the performance of planned configurations is calculated, and the optimised configuration is obtained.

AB Nearest neighbor search, also known as NNS, is a technique used to locate the points in a high-dimensional space closest to a given query point. This technique has multiple applications in medicine, such as searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, and diagnosis. However, when the number of points is significantly large, the brute-force approach for finding the nearest neighbor becomes computationally infeasible. Therefore, various approaches have been developed to make the search faster and more efficient to support the applications. With a focus on medical imaging, this paper proposes DENSELINKSEARCH (DLS), an effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a medical database, the proposed algorithm builds an index that consists of pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest neighbor. We also explore the role of medical image feature representation in content-based medical image retrieval tasks. We propose a Transformer-based feature representation technique that outperformed the existing pre-trained Transformer-based approaches on benchmark medical image retrieval datasets. We extensively tested the proposed NNS approach and compared the performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing approaches in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. In comparison to the existing approximate NNS approaches, our proposed DLS approach outperformed them in terms of lower average time per query and & GE; 99% R@10 on 11 out of 13 benchmark datasets. We also found that the proposed medical feature representation approach is better for representing medical images compared to the existing pre-trained image models. The proposed feature extraction strategy obtained an improvement of 9.37%, 7.0%, and 13.33% in terms of P@5, P@10, and P@20, respectively, in comparison to the best-performing pre-trained image model.

AB Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) method is an efficient first-order algorithm for optimization problems. To ensure the convergence, it usually takes a relatively conservative constant as the stepsize. However, the choice of stepsize has a great impact on the optimization process. In this paper, two adaptive stepsize estimation methods are proposed for complex-valued NAG algorithm for efficient training of fully complex-valued neural networks. The basic idea of the first one is to adaptively determine suitable stepsize by estimating the local smoothness constant of the loss function with the norm of approximate complex Hessian matrix. Its validity is theoretically analyzed by means of the decomposition of complex matrix. Furthermore, by introducing a new parameter design method for multi-step quasi-Newton condition, an improved stepsize estimation is presented. Experimental results on pattern recognition, channel equalization, wind forecasting and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The rise of deep learning approaches has boosted the modern computing capabilities and paved the way to novel outstanding applications. Recently, deep neural networks (DNN) have caught an increasing attraction in the field of PV cells detection and fault classification. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were proved as DNNs that provide more reliable results in diagnosing these faults. On the other hand, Electroluminescence imaging (EL) analysis has been recognized as a powerful tool for addressing PV models malfunctions. In this work, an effective fault detection and classification approach is developed using multi-scale CNN-based models using two scenarios: a) a transfer learning-based approach using two selected DNNs (ResNet18 and ShuffleNet), and b) an independent light-depth CNN (denoted as CNN-ILD). CNN-ILD is a light CNN based on the insertion of parallel convolutional branches with low-to-high kernel sizes. This construction allowed CNN-ILD to capture a wide variety of features ranging from elementary to specific textures and patterns. The public ELPV dataset has been adopted after proper preprocessing and class categorization. The experimental results have shown promising classification results (88.41%-98.05%) of PV cell defects in EL images. CNN-ILD has a privilege in terms of the computational power/time and stability over the other two proposed pretrained DNNs.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; RADIOLOGY
AB Automatically generating a report from a patient's Chest X-Rays (CXRs) is a promising solution to reducing clinical workload and improving patient care. However, current CXR report generators -- which are predominantly encoder-to-decoder models -- lack the diagnostic accuracy to be deployed in a clinical setting. To improve CXR report generation, we investigate warm starting the encoder and decoder with recent open-source computer vision and natural language processing checkpoints, such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and PubMedBERT. To this end, each checkpoint is evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray datasets. Our experimental investigation demonstrates that the Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT) ImageNet-21K and the Distilled Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (DistilGPT2) checkpoints are best for warm starting the encoder and decoder, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art (M2 Transformer Progressive), CvT2DistilGPT2 attained an improvement of 8.3\% for CE F-1, 1.8\% for BLEU-4, 1.6\% for ROUGE-L, and 1.0\% for METEOR. The reports generated by CvT2DistilGPT2 have a higher similarity to radiologist reports than previous approaches. This indicates that leveraging warm starting improves CXR report generation. Code and checkpoints for CvT2DistilGPT2 are available at this https://github.com/achre/cvt2distiglgpt2.

AB This paper proposes a novel approach named adaptive multi-scale attention convolution neural network (AmaCNN) to accurately detect cross-domain faults with very few labelled data. In AmaCNN, multi-scale feature fusion CNN (MSFFCNN) with a multi-level attention scheme (MLAS) extracts multi-scale less-noise features from source and target domains. Considering the domain shift and semantic difference in the two domain features, a cross-domain adaption (CDA) scheme is applied. Significantly, the extracted domain features are measured with correlation alignment (CORAL) distance to minimize the domain shift first. Then, semantic alignment (SA) loss aligns and separates domain-invariant features point-by-point. Therefore, the proposed AmaCNN could learn rich multi-scale, less-noise, domain-invariant, and semantic-alignment features using limited training samples to detect cross-fault accurately. The experimental results on three real data sets confirmed its priority and reliability. Besides, the in-depth analysis has confirmed each component's effectiveness and CDA's good generality.

AB The non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) enables easy detection of developing heart abnormalities, leading to a significant reduction in infant mortality rate and post-natal complications. Due to the overlapping of maternal and fetal R-peaks, the low amplitude of the fECG, systematic and ambient noises, typical signal extraction methods, such as adaptive filters, independent component analysis, empirical mode decomposition, etc., are unable to produce satisfactory fECG. While some techniques can produce accurate QRS waves, they often ignore other important aspects of the ECG. Utilizing extensive preprocessing and an appropriate framework, our approach, built upon 1D CycleGAN, achieves fECG signal reconstruction from the mECG signal while preserving its morphology. The performance of our solution was evaluated by combining two available datasets from Physionet, "Abdominal and Direct Fetal ECG Database" and "Fetal electrocardiograms, direct and abdominal with reference heartbeat annotations", where it achieved an average PCC and Spectral-Correlation score of 88.4% and 89.4%, respectively. It detects the fQRS of the signal with accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 92.6%, 97.6%, 94.8% and 96.4%, respectively. It can also accurately produce the estimation of fetal heart rate and R-R interval with an error of 0.25% and 0.27%, respectively. The main contribution of our work is that, unlike similar studies, it can retain the morphology of the ECG signal with high fidelity. The accuracy of our solution for fetal heart rate and R-R interval length is comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. This makes it a highly effective tool for early diagnosis of fetal heart diseases and regular health checkups of the fetus.

AB With the development of intelligent logistics technology, some companies began to use robots instead of humans to load cargo. This paper studies a novel container loading problem based on robotic loader system (CLP-RLS). Different from the existing robot-packable pattern in the literature, the robotic loader system in this paper consists of a depalletizing robot, an automatic telescopic roller line and a loading robot, in which the loading robot will enter the carriage along with the automatic telescopic roller line. In CLP-RLS, it is necessary to consider not only many practical constraints already in the literature, including load balancing, orientation, stability, and multi-drop but also two new constraints related to robotic loader system: pallet continuity constraint (the loading sequence of cargo on the same pallet is continuous) and robot position constraint (the robot can only load cargo incrementally from the front to the back of the truck). Due to the difficulty in modeling CLP-RLS and the large scale of the real-case instances, we present a tree search approach based on wall-building to solve CLP-RLS, intending to find a feasible loading scheme for the RLS to minimize the length required to load all cargo. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through both real-case instances and numerical instances.

AB Convolutional neural networks are now seeing widespread use in a variety of fields, including image classification, facial and object recognition, medical imaging analysis, and many more. In addition, there are applications such as physics-informed simulators in which accurate forecasts in real time with a minimal lag are required. The present neural network designs include millions of parameters, which makes it difficult to install such complex models on devices that have limited memory. Compression techniques might be able to resolve these issues by decreasing the size of CNN models that are created by reducing the number of parameters that contribute to the complexity of the models. We propose a compressed tensor format of convolutional layer, a priori, before the training of the neural network. 3-way kernels or 2-way kernels in convolutional layers are replaced by one-way fiters. The overfitting phenomena will be reduced also. The time needed to make predictions or time required for training using the original Convolutional Neural Networks model would be cut significantly if there were fewer parameters to deal with. In this paper we present a method of a priori compressing convolutional neural networks for finite element (FE) predictions of physical data. Afterwards we validate our a priori compressed models on physical data from a FE model solving a 2D wave equation. We show that the proposed convolutional compression technique achieves equivalent performance in the prediction error as classical convolutional layers with fewer trainable parameters(around 20%) and lower memory footprint.

AB This work proposes an intra-Class-confidence and inter-Class-confusion guided Dynamic Contrastive (CCDC) learning framework for medical image segmentation. A core contribution is to dynamically select the most expressive pixels to build positive and negative pairs for contrastive learning at different training phases. For the positive pairs, dynamically adaptive sampling strategies are introduced for sampling different sets of pixels based on their hardness (namely the easiest, easy, and hard pixels). For the negative pairs, to efficiently learn from the classes with high confusion degree w.r.t a query class (i.e., a class containing the query pixels), a new hard class mining strategy is presented. Furthermore, pixel-level representations are extended to the neighbourhood region to leverage the spatial consistency of adjacent pixels. Extensive experiments on the three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art.

AB In this paper, we propose an improved filtering algorithm for regular constraint, which demand that the sequence of all assignments for variables can be accepted by a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) or a regular language. Regular constraint is a type of global constraint in Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) and a natural expression of deterministic patterns in planning and decision making, and it utilizes the properties of DFA to pre-specify the optional paths for multiple variables. Thus, it is sensible to improve the filtering algorithm that enforces Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) for regular constraint in order to minimize memory and time consumption. With the goal in mind, we encode DFA using bit vectors and then devise a bit operations algorithm to maintain the domain consistency for regular constraint. Lastly, we carry out an experiment to compare to the state-of-the-art filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly improves both memory and time.

ID MODEL
AB Due to an increase in decision making sophistication and risk, behavioural three-way decision making has replaced traditional two-way decision making. Accordingly, this study proposes a novus three-way multi-attribute decision making model by creating three-way decision rules in context of multi-attribute decision-making with two key behavioural theories, namely, regret and prospect theories. To capture uncertainty in the evaluation information, q-rung orthopair fuzzy set is implemented in the information system. After that, a new method is forwarded based on correlation coefficient and variance to calculate the weights of attributes. In light of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, q-rung orthopair fuzzy Mahalanobis distance is developed. Then, regret-based dominated relation and rejoice-based dominating relation are defined. Thereafter, a new procedure is developed to estimate the conditional probability according to two above-mentioned relations. Three kinds of scoring functions are developed with the help of prospect theory, based on which, despondent, expectant, and balanced tactics are developed to illustrate three mindsets of decision maker. Ultimately, three sizeable datasets gathered from the KEEL and UCI databases are used to demonstrate the legitimacy, resiliency, and supremacy of the constructed model.

ID JOINT ENTITY
AB The text of software knowledge community contains abundant knowledge of software engineering field. The software knowledge entity and relation can be extracted automatically and efficiently to form the software knowledge graph, which is helpful for software knowledge-centric intelligent applications, such as intelligent question answering, automatic document generation and software expert recommendation. Most existing methods are confronted with problems of task dependence and entity overlap. In this paper, we propose a software knowledge extraction method based on span-level contrastive learning. From the level of sentence sequence modelling, we model the sentence sequence with span as a unit, and generate abundant positive and negative samples of entity span through the span representation layer to avoid the problem that the token-level method cannot select overlapping entities. From the level of feature learning, we propose supervised entity contrastive learning and relation contrastive learning, which obtain enhanced feature representation of entity span and entity pair through positive and negative sample enhancement and contrastive loss function construction. Experiments are conducted on the dataset which is constructed based on texts of the StackOverflow, and show that our approach achieves a better performance than baseline models.

AB Numerous electric vehicles (EVs) consumers express their opinions about EVs on automotive websites. These online reviews can be mined and analyzed to understand consumer sentiment and preferences. Although the existing sentiment analysis (SA) has made insight into sentiment polarity of EVs, the SA results on different EV attributes do not consider the accuracy of sentiment classification and the difficulty of accurately obtaining attribute weights in the process of all attribute information fusion. To address these issues, we provide an integrated framework for the EV SA problem using the stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis (SMAA) method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs). We first use a logistic regression model to classify the sentiment polarity for each online comment and construct IT2FS by sentiment classification accuracy to represent the SA results for different EV attributes. Based on this, we considered all feasible weights in the weight space and utilize the SMAAIT2FS method to aggregate SA results and achieve EV ranking. In addition, our approach provide decision makers with information to assist in decision-making such as the use of central weight vectors to identify the strengths and weaknesses of EVs and the analysis of potential competitors through dominance relationships. Finally, real data extracted from AutoHome websites are used as experimental data to illustrate the implementation of the proposed method and to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Air pollution caused by particulate matter with a diameter of less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. Predicting PM2.5 concentrations and controlling emissions are crucial for pollution prevention and control. This study proposes a comprehensive solution based on weight-sharing deep learning and multi-objective optimization. The proposed approach first utilizes a model that combines the Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network to analyze data from 13 air quality monitoring stations in Xi'an City. By simultaneously inputting data from different monitoring stations, the model can extract highly correlated spatiotemporal features, enabling accurate predictions of PM2.5 concentrations for specific monitoring stations using LSTM. In addition, a multi-objective optimization model is established with the primary goal of achieving maximum total emission reduction. This model takes into account four key factors: the total emission reduction, the task of emission reduction, the government subsidy, and the total cost of emission reduction. To obtain the emission reduction of PM2.5 concentration at 13 monitoring stations, 5 classical intelligence algorithms are employed to solve the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction model, with an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.820 and a fitting coefficient (R-2) of 0.907, outperforming all comparison models. The proposed model exhibits strong generalization ability, making it applicable to different time and space conditions. Furthermore, it can be adapted for calculating emission reduction of other air pollutants. Lastly, the multiobjective optimization model achieves significant success in terms of total emission reduction. This study provides a new reference in the field of artificial intelligence and its application to air pollution control. The findings hold great significance for promoting public health and environmental protection.

AB Graph neural networks have demonstrated significant power in learning graph representations for homogeneous networks. However, real-world network data can often be denoted by heterogeneous networks with different types of nodes and edges, such as social, traffic, and molecular networks. Network heterogeneity presents significant challenges for network analysis and mining. Motif-based hypergraphs preserve high-order proximity and capture composite semantic interactions. Because not all nodes and edges in the original network always exist in a specific hypergraph, it is essential that multiple motif-based hypergraphs are considered to enhance the network representation. Therefore, we propose a novel framework for exploring Multiple Motif-based Hypergraphs for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks to learn network representations, named MoH-HGNN, which leverages hypergraph convolution and attention operations to capture complex connectivity patterns. Specifically, we conducted two levels of attention networks with hierarchical structures, namely hyperedge-level attention to learn the importance among different types of nodes and comprehensive semantic level attention to capture the importance of different types of motif structures. We extensively experimented on four real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB Most intracellular activities of living organisms are performed by proteins that have unique and complex 3 Dimensional (3D) structures, playing very important roles in their operations. Due to importance and challenges of predicting 3D structures for proteins, laboratory methods with limitations such as time consuming and high cost have been developed. Computational methods use a sequence of amino acids to obtain the 3D structure. They encounter with a nondeterministic problem having polynomial completion time (NP-Complete problem); with a chain of amino acids as input, and a protein, with 3D structure, as output. In this paper, a new population based algorithm, under Predatory Search Strategy-Particle Swarm Optimization (PSS-PSO) framework, is presented for predicting the 3D structure; using Hydrophobic-Polar (HP) model on Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice. In this approach, name TRL-PSSPSO, two new moves are proposed to direct each solution toward the native structure: Local Move for reaching a dense hydrophobic core and large H-H contacts and Meta Move for reaching optimal structure, by using Transfer learning. Two datasets are considered for evaluating and the results on some set of standard protein benchmarks show outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. They show that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of template-free prediction in an acceptable manner.

LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-view learning; subspace clustering; graph learning; joint
   optimization
AB Multi-view subspace clustering (MSC) is a popular unsupervised method by integrating heterogeneous information to reveal the intrinsic clustering structure hidden across views. Usually, MSC methods use graphs (or affinity matrices) fusion to learn a common structure, and further apply graph-based approaches to clustering. Despite progress, most of the methods do not establish the connection between graph learning and clustering. Meanwhile, conventional graph fusion strategies assign coarse-grained weights to combine multi-graph, ignoring the importance of local structure. In this article, we propose a fine-grained graph learning framework for multi-view subspace clustering (FGL-MSC) to address these issues. To utilize the multi-view information sufficiently, we design a specific graph learning method by introducing graph regularization and a local structure fusion pattern. The main challenge is how to optimize the fine-grained fusion weights while generating the learned graph that fits the clustering task, thus making the clustering representation meaningful and competitive. Accordingly, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the above joint optimization problem, which obtains the learned graph, the clustering representation, and the fusion weights simultaneously. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show that the proposed framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Trial production is essential for some manufacturing systems to adjust production lines before mass production. Scheduling for trial production promotes carrying out mass production activities faster. In this paper, a set of job families with setup time should be processed on several identical parallel machines, in which jobs belonging to the same family are processed according to multitasking scheduling. The objective is to minimize the total weighted completion time. Structural properties of the investigated problem are proposed. Subsequently, a novel branch-and-price algorithm (B & P) is proposed. In detail, a label-setting algorithm is presented for fast solving the pricing problem of B & P, and the structural properties are utilized to speed up the algorithm. Computational results show that the proposed B & P has an excellent performance in both optimality and efficiency. Within the limit time of 1800 seconds, B & P is able to optimally solve 100.00% of small-size problems and 91.11% of large-size problems. The average gap of B & P in percentage between the upper bound and theoretical lower bound is close to 0.00%. Results of the final case study demonstrate that, in general, the proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of the trial production plan.

AB Scene text detection has drawn increasing attention due to its potential scalability to large-scale applications. Currently, a well-trained scene text detection model on a source domain usually has unsatisfactory performance when it is migrated to e large domain shift between them. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel network integrates both text-specific Faster R-CNN (ts-FRCNN) and domain adaptation (ts-DA) into one framework. Compared to conventional FRCNN, ts-FRCNN designs a text-specific RPN to generate more accurate region proposals by considering the inherent characters of scene text, as well as text-specific RoI pooling to extract purer and sufficient fine-grained text features by adopting an adaptive asymmetric griding strategy. Compared to conventional domain adaptation, ts-DA adopts a triple-level alignment strategy to reduce the domain shift at the image, word and character levels, and builds a triple-consistency regularization among them, which significantly promotes domain-invariant text feature learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative transfer learning tasks: common-to-extreme scenes, real-to-real scenes and synthetic-to-real scenes. The experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms the previous methods.

ID STRATEGY
AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) can dispatch its powerful servers close by to assist with the computation workloads that intelligent wireless terminals have offloaded. The MEC server's physical location is closer to the intelligent wireless terminals, which can satisfy the low latency and high reliability demands. In this paper, we formulate an MEC framework with multiple vehicles and service devices that considers the priority and randomness of arriving workloads from roadside units (RSUs), cameras, laser radars (Lidar) and the time-varying channel state between the service device and MEC server (MEC-S). To minimize the long-term weighted average cost of the proposed MEC system, we transit this issue (cost minimization problem) into the Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, considering the difficulty realizing the state transition probability matrix, the dimensional complexity of the state space, and the continuity of the action space, we propose a deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-based bandwidth partition and power allocation optimization policy. The proposed MADDPG-based policy is a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method, which can effectively deal with continuous action space and further guide multi-agent to execute decision-making. The comprehensive results verify that the proposed MADDPG-based optimization scheme has fine convergence and performance that is better than that of the other four baseline algorithms.

AB Over recent decades, research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has developed a broad range of approaches and methods that can be utilized or adapted to address complex optimization problems. As real-world problems get increasingly complicated, this requires an effective optimization method. Various meta-heuristic algorithms have been developed and applied in the optimization domain. This paper used and ameliorated a promising meta-heuristic approach named Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) to address numerical optimization problems. Although CSA can efficiently optimize many problems, it needs more searchability and early convergence. Its positioning updating process was improved by supporting two adaptive parameters: flight length (fl) and awareness probability (AP) to tackle these curbs. This is to manage the exploration and exploitation conducts of CSA in the search space. This process takes advantage of the randomization of crows in CSA and the adoption of well-known growth functions. These functions were recognized as exponential, power, and S-shaped functions to develop three different improved versions of CSA, referred to as Exponential CSA (ECSA), Power CSA (PCSA), and S-shaped CSA (SCSA). In each of these variants, two different functions were used to amend the values of fl and AP. A new dominant parameter was added to the positioning updating process of these algorithms to enhance exploration and exploitation behaviors further. The reliability of the proposed algorithms was evaluated on 67 benchmark functions, and their performance was quantified using relevant assessment criteria. The functionality of these algorithms was illustrated by tackling four engineering design problems. A comparative study was made to explore the efficacy of the proposed algorithms over the standard one and other methods. Overall results showed that ECSA, PCSA, and SCSA have convincing merits with superior performance compared to the others.

AB Availability and accessibility of data objects in a reasonable time is a main issue in distributed systems like cloud computing services. As a result, the reduction of data-related operation times in distributed systems such as data read/write has become a major challenge in the development of these systems. In this regard, replicating the data objects on different servers is one commonly used technique. In general, replica placement plays an essential role in the efficiency of distributed systems and can be implemented statically or dynamically. Estimation of the minimum number of data replicas and the optimal placement of the replicas is an NP-complete optimization problem. Hence, different heuristic algorithms have been proposed for optimal replica placement in distributed systems. Reducing data processing costs as well as the number of replicas, and increasing the reliability of the replica placement algorithms are the main goals of this research. This paper presents a discrete and swarm-evolutionary method using a combination of shuffle-frog leaping and genetic algorithms to data-replica placement problems in distributed systems. The experiments on the standard dataset show that the proposed method reduces data access time by up to 30% with about 14 replicas; whereas the generated replicas by the GA and ACO are, respectively, 24 and 30. The average reduction in data access time by GA and ACO 21% and 18% which shows less efficiency than the SFLA-GA algorithm. Regarding the results, the SFLA-GA converges on the optimal solution before the 10th iteration, which shows the higher performance of the proposed method. Furthermore, the standard deviation among the results obtained by the proposed method on several runs is about 0.029, which is lower than other algorithms. Additionally, the proposed method has a higher success rate than other algorithms in the replica placement problem.

AB Breast cancer develops in breast cells. It is the most common type of cancer in women and the second most lethal disease after lung cancer. The presence of breast masses is an important symptom for detecting breast cancer in its early stages. This study proposes a hybrid features extraction method to improve the automatic detection of breast cancer by combining three feature extraction methods: Kinetic Features, convolutional neural network deep learning features, and the newly proposed Quantum Chebyshev polynomials model. The long short-term memory model is used as a classifier in this study to detect breast cancer automatically, which could reduce human errors in the diagnosis process. The experimental results using a large publicly available dataset achieved a detection accuracy of 99.50% for hybrid features in post-contrast 2, potentially reducing human errors in the diagnosis process.

AB The transit-oriented development (TOD) and arts and culture-led urban development (AUD) have been evolved as two of primary strategies for sustainable urban revitalization. Ex-ante sustainability evaluation has emerged as a crucial procedure in the field of urban renewal to prevent non-sustainable redevelopment projects. However, in the ex-ante evaluation of urban renewal projects, TOD and AUD have ambiguous indicators, imprecise weights, and undetermined evaluation methodologies. To fill these gaps, this work combines GIS, fuzzy theory, and decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) to build an ex-ante evaluation model for evaluating the sustainability potential of urban renewal projects. Three areas in Guangzhou that are undergoing reconstruction and development are used as empirical instances in this study. This study provides a hierarchical structure of the evaluation framework which contains three dimensions, five criteria, and twenty-seven indicators, and also obtains the influential relationships among five criteria. In the empirical scenario, the Guangzhou Steel New Town area (GSNT) is reflected in the large potential benefits in both directions (i.e., TOD and AUD). In contrast, the existing urban renewal development plan does not adequately utilize the potential of the Shiqiao (SQ) area. This study, therefore, proposes that to increase land-use efficiency and subsequently economic development, the SQ area should either start from the current conditions or adapt its current strategy to renewal. With the help of this study, local decision-makers may examine the viability of urban renewal initiatives and gauge the possibility for three crucial Guangzhou urban renewal areas to flourish sustainably. This study also offers a decision-base for prospective future improvement in response to the evaluation outcomes.

AB Collecting data such vibration signal or others from elevators is crucial for a regular maintenance or emergency repair in industry. However, traditional methods for data transmission through compression and decompression process usually require large input data arrays to be assigned. Therefore, a long computational time is unavoidable so that it may affect system performance efficiency significantly. Therefore, an elevator vibration and loading data collection system was developed using simple compression encoding mechanism. First, in Data Acquisition Unit, the signal-acquiring microprocessor is used for data acquisition through Inter-Integrated Circuit ((IC)-C-2) bus. Second, in Data Storage Unit, the collected data from the signal-acquiring microprocessor is compressed and transmitted to the signal-processing microprocessor. Third, in Monitor Unit, the elevator analysis tool is developed to analyze the vibration data, which can be viewed directly from APP. Experimental results demonstrated that the restored data are consistent with the results measured from the standard instrument. The proposed hexadecimal compression process can make the data transmission mechanism simple, but two times faster than that using traditional way without compression. Consequently, the demanded memory capacity for signal transmission can be therefore reduced considerably.

AB Training language-conditioned policies is typically time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, the resulting controllers are tailored to the specific robot they were trained on, making it difficult to transfer them to other robots with different dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach called Hierarchical Modularity, which enables more efficient training and subsequent transfer of such policies across different types of robots. The approach incorporates Supervised Attention which bridges the gap between modular and end-to-end learning by enabling the re-use of functional building blocks. In this contribution, we build upon our previous work, showcasing the extended utilities and improved performance by expanding the hierarchy to include new tasks and introducing an automated pipeline for synthesizing a large quantity of novel objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through extensive simulated and real-world robot manipulation experiments.

AB Identifying and annotating toxic online content on social media platforms is an extremely challenging problem. Work that studies toxicity in online content has predominantly focused on comments as independent entities. However, comments on social media are inherently conversational, and therefore, understanding and judging the comments fundamentally requires access to the context in which they are made. We introduce a study and resulting annotated dataset where we devise a number of controlled experiments on the importance of context and other observable confounders - namely gender, age and political orientation - towards the perception of toxicity in online content. Our analysis clearly shows the significance of context and the effect of observable confounders on annotations. Namely, we observe that the ratio of toxic to non-toxic judgements can be very different for each control group, and a higher proportion of samples are judged toxic in the presence of contextual information.

AB The recently released BARD and ChatGPT have generated substantial interest from a range of researchers and institutions concerned about the impact on education, medicine, law and more. This paper uses questions from the Watson Jeopardy! Challenge to compare BARD, ChatGPT, and Watson. Using those, Jeopardy! questions, we find that for high confidence Watson questions the three systems perform with similar accuracy as Watson. We also find that both BARD and ChatGPT perform with the accuracy of a human expert and that the sets of their correct answers are rated highly similar using a Tanimoto similarity score. However, in addition, we find that both systems can change their solutions to the same input information on subsequent uses. When given the same Jeopardy! category and question multiple times, both BARD and ChatGPT can generate different and conflicting answers. As a result, the paper examines the characteristics of some of those questions that generate different answers to the same inputs. Finally, the paper discusses some of the implications of finding the different answers and the impact of the lack of reproducibility on testing such systems.

ID BRAIN NETWORKS
AB Synchronization is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that enables the orderly presentation of information. In the human brain, for instance, functional modules such as the visual, motor, and language cortices form through neuronal synchronization. Inspired by biological brains and previous neuroscience studies, we propose an interpretable neural network incorporating a synchronization mechanism. The basic idea is to constrain each neuron, such as a convolution filter, to capture a single semantic pattern while synchronizing similar neurons to facilitate the formation of interpretable functional modules. Specifically, we regularize the activation map of a neuron to surround its focus position of the activated pattern in a sample. Moreover, neurons locally interact with each other, and similar ones are synchronized together during the training phase adaptively. Such local aggregation preserves the globally distributed representation nature of the neural network model, enabling a reasonably interpretable representation. To analyze the neuron interpretability comprehensively, we introduce a series of novel evaluation metrics from multiple aspects. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of interpretability. The resulting synchronized functional modules show module consistency across data and semantic specificity within modules.

AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide a direct pathway from the brain to external devices and have demonstrated great potential for assistive and rehabilitation technologies. Endogenous BCIs based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, such as motor imagery (MI) BCIs, can provide some level of control. However, mastering spontaneous BCI control requires the users to generate discriminative and stable brain signal patterns by imagery, which is challenging and is usually achieved over a very long training time (weeks/months). Here, we propose a human-machine joint learning framework to boost the learning process in endogenous BCIs, by guiding the user to generate brain signals toward an optimal distribution estimated by the decoder, given the historical brain signals of the user. To this end, we first model the human-machine joint learning process in a uniform formulation. Then a human-machine joint learning framework is proposed: 1) for the human side, we model the learning process in a sequential trial-and-error scenario and propose a novel "copy/new" feedback paradigm to help shape the signal generation of the subject toward the optimal distribution and 2) for the machine side, we propose a novel adaptive learning algorithm to learn an optimal signal distribution along with the subject's learning process. Specifically, the decoder reweighs the brain signals generated by the subject to focus more on "good" samples to cope with the learning process of the subject. Online and psuedo-online BCI experiments with 18 healthy subjects demonstrated the advantages of the proposed joint learning process over coadaptive approaches in both learning efficiency and effectiveness.

AB In recent years, there has been increasingly more discussion about sonification design, evaluation strategies, and the future of sonification in general. Concerns relate to the efficacy and usability of sonification methodologies and the lack of evidence supporting design choices. In sonification publications to date, there is little discussion on how the principles of psychoacoustics or auditory scene analysis (ASA) might be used to improve design methodologies. Proposed in this article is the perceptually congruent sonification (PerCS) model that highlights the links between sonification mappings and key perceptual factors that are most likely to affect the interpretability of sonified trends. The model explores the perceptual constraints associated with design choices such as presentation rate, tonality, space, and frequency range. The model highlights the dependencies these mappings have on our perception of frequency, timbre, loudness, and space: the core determinants of stream segregation (a key phenomenon of ASA). This model-centred approach is used to identify perceptually congruent design choices for auditory line charts, a popular and accessible form of parameter-mapping sonification. This article focuses predominately on identifying an efficient and perceptually congruent frequency range for auditory line charts, as there are no contemporary studies on this design choice, with auditory graphing tools leaving little guidance on what might be appropriate. Several psychoacoustically justified ranges are proposed by the PerCS research and are contrasted in a user study to determine the performance of narrow vs wide frequency ranges. Results show that a shorter range between 400 and 1400 Hz performs just as well as a wider range between 65 Hz and 1480 Hz.

AB A cellular automata model has been developed to study the sintering behavior of ceramic particles. In this model, the only physical rule that drives the evolution of the system is to reduce the energy at the interface between the mass cells and the void cells. The meaning of several computational parameters, such as particle size or computational temperature, were investigated. Experiments of partial sintering of spherical particles of silica were performed and it was verified that this model successfully mimics the neck formation. Moreover, other experimental evidences of the stages of the densification, such as the formation of the intermediate vermicular microstructure or the dependence of porosity with temperature, were also qualitatively simulated.

AB As we navigate physical (e.g., supermarket) and digital (e.g., social media) systems, we generate personal data about our behavior. Researchers and designers increasingly rely on this data and appeal to several approaches to collect it. One of these is data donation, which encourages people to voluntarily transfer their (personal) data collected by external parties to a specific cause. One of the central pillars of data donation is informed consent, meaning people should be adequately informed about what and how their data will be used. However, can we be adequately informed when it comes to donating our data when many times we don't even know it is being collected and, even more so, what exactly is being collected? In this paper, we investigate how to foster (personal) data literacy and increase donors' understanding of their data. We introduce a Research through Design approach where we define a data donation journey in the context of speech records, data collected by Google Assistant. Based on the data donation experiences of 22 donors, we propose a data donation framework that understands and approaches data donation as an encompassing process with mutual benefit for donors and researchers. Our framework supports a donation process that dynamically and iteratively engages donors in exploring and understanding their data and invites them to (re)evaluate and (re)assess their participation. Through this process, donors increase their data literacy and are empowered to give meaningfully informed consent.

AB Gradient-based optimizer (GRAD) belongs to the recently developed population-based metaheuristic algorithms inspired by the development of Newton-type methods. Despite its new emergence, there are many successful applications of this optimizer in the existing literature; however, chaos integrated version of this algorithm has not been extensively studied yet. In his study, twenty-one different chaotic maps have been incorporated into the standard GRAD algorithm to maintain a reliable balance between exploration and exploitation mechanisms, which is not robustly constructed within the original algorithm. First ninety-nine thirty dimensional artificially generated optimization benchmark problems comprised of sixty-eight multimodal and thirty-one unimodal functions have been solved by these chaotic variants of the GRAD algorithm to determine the five best performing methods between them. Clear dominancy of the chaotic algorithms is clearly observed over the entire range of benchmark cases in terms of solution accuracy and robustness. Then, to validate the optimization capability of the chaos integrated GRAD algorithms, the best method among them is tested on fourteen constrained real world engineering problems, and its respective feasible results are benchmarked against those obtained from cutting edge metaheuristic optimizer. It is seen that the chaotic GRAD algorithm is able to effectively compete with other state-of-art algorithms on both solving unconstrained and constrained engineering problems. Moreover, it is observed that the Chebyshev chaotic map improved GRAD algorithm outperforms its contemporaries in both unconstrained and constrained cases.

The 'shape' of data, or in other words its related topological properties, can provide crucial insights into the corresponding data types and sources and it enables the identification of general properties that facilitate its analysis and assessment. In this article, we discuss an information theoretic approach combined with data homological properties to assess dimensionality reduction, which can be applied to semantic feature selection.

AB Intuitionistic fuzzy time series methods provide a good alternative to the forecasting problem. It is possible to use the historical values of the time series as well as the membership and non-membership values obtained for the historical values as effective factors in improving the forecasting performance. In this study, a high order single variable intuitionistic fuzzy time series reduced forecasting model is first introduced. A new forecasting method is proposed for the solution of the forecasting problem in which the functional structure between the historical information of the intuitionistic time series and the forecast is obtained by bagging of decision trees based on the high order single variable intuitionistic fuzzy time series reduced forecasting model. In this study, intuitionistic clustering is employed to create intuitionistic fuzzy time series. To create a simpler functional structure with Bagging of decision trees, the input data from lagged variables, memberships, and non-membership values are subjected to dimension reduction by principal component analysis. The performance of the proposed method is compared with popular forecasting methods in the literature for ten different time series randomly obtained from the S & P500 stock market. According to the results of the analyses, the forecasting performance of the proposed method is better than both classical forecasting methods and some popular shallow and deep neural networks.

ID APPROXIMATION; SYSTEM; WAVES
AB Recently, with increasing urban traffic congestion, there has been an upsurge in studies on reinforcement learning for traffic signal control (RL-TSC), which enables efficient traffic management. However, most existing RL-TSC research relies on simulation, and instances of real-world application are relatively scarce. Furthermore, existing RL-TSC methods employ a step-based approach, controlling traffic signals every short step. This approach can be inefficient in oversaturated traffic conditions, where large deviations in traffic demand between movements prevent traffic signals from being effectively managed based on the overall traffic situation. In this study, we aim to transform simulation-based RL-TSC into a more practical and applicable model. We have developed a RL-TSC method capable of responding to oversaturated traffic conditions, designing an action space that enables the agent to derive an optimal signal set for every cycle length, thereby understanding the traffic situation across all movements. During each cycle length, our proposed model conducts traffic signal optimization and identifies the optimal signal through an iterative exploration. To facilitate a fast and accurate strategy search process, we developed a kinematic wave-based mesoscopic model. This model estimates the density across the entire link, based on collected traffic data and derives the state and reward values. We have validated the field applicability of the proposed RL-TSC method through a real-world demonstration at a congested inter-section in Seoul, Korea. The results indicated a significant improvement in traffic congestion, with the average queue length at the intersection reduced by up to 11.4%.

AB Grape seed oil (GSO) authentication and classification have recently become the most important aspects of edible oil quality control due to its high nutritional values. In the present contribution, excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy and sparse chemometric methods were used for the classification of GSO obtained from different Iranian grape genotypes and the detection of GSO adulteration with refined sunflower oil (SFO). The fluorescence spectra were collected in the wavelength ranges of & lambda;ex = 200-500 nm and & lambda;em = 200-800 nm. To develop multivariate models, more than 200 samples from five different varieties of GSO were used. The sparse version of N-way partial least squares discriminant analysis (sNPLS-DA) was utilized to build an interpretable classification model. Classification accuracies for the sNPLS-DA model were 1.00 for predicting all grape genotypes. The collected fluorescence data revealed a distinct intensity difference between the Chafteh GSO and other GSOs in & lambda;ex = 270-310 nm, and & lambda;em = 300-350 nm. To simulate the adulteration of GSO with SFO, 35 binary blends of Chafteh GSO samples (as a higher-quality oil) were prepared at adulterant levels from 10% to 50%. Sparse multivariate regression techniques, including the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso), Ridge, and Elastic net were applied for quantitative analysis of GSO adulteration. The coefficient of multiple determination (R2) and the RMSE for the Lasso model were 0.914 and 0.013, respectively, for the external test sets. The results showed that the sparse chemometric methods coupled with excitation-emission fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as interpretable and reliable tools for quality control and adulteration detection of oil samples in the food industry and commerce.

AB This paper introduces the notion of learning from contradictions (a.k.a Universum learning) for deep one class classification problems. We formalize this notion for the widely adopted one class large-margin loss (Scholkopf et al. in Neural Comput 13(7):1443-1471), and propose the deep one class classification using contradictions (DOC3) algorithm. We show that learning from contradictions incurs lower generalization error by comparing the empirical Rademacher complexity of DOC3 against its traditional inductive learning counterpart. Further, our proposed 'learning from contradiction' is a generic learning setting and can compliment other advanced learning settings. To illustrate this, we extend the adversarial learning based DROCC-LF (Goyal et al. in International conference on machine learning, PMLR, 2020) algorithm under this newsetting. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of DOC3 and it's extensions compared to popular baseline algorithms on several benchmark and real-life data sets.

AB Unimodal biometrics has various issues: noisy data, inter-class similarities, intra-class similarities, spoofing, and non-universality, making this system less secure and accurate. Compared to this Unimodal, multi-modal biometrics has various benefits such as high accuracy, low error rate and larger population coverage. Generally, multi-modal biometrics systems enhance integrity and privacy, as it stores different biometric characteristics of every user. Therefore, the multi-modal biometric template must be protected to avoid leaking biometric information to an adversary. An innovative multi-modal system is introduced, combining two biometric traits, fingerprint and retina. However, the deep learning (DL) approach will be hybrid with the hashing method to improve the template's security. In recent years, DL has presented a great demand in multi-modal biometric devices for feature extraction. This proposed methodology consists of pre-processing, feature extraction, and hashing. Pre-processing takes place for image resizing and augmentation purposes. In the feature extraction stage, CNN has been used to extract spatial information. It doesn't provide a correlation between the adjacent features. To solve this, efficiently combine the CNN and BiGRU model with the self-awareness layer (ConvGRUSA). In ConvGRUSA, the parameters are tuned using the tunicate swarm optimization (Tuni-SO) algorithm. With the aid of BiGRU, the correlation between the adjacent features is detected. Finally, the self-attention layer fuses the deep features using spatial-wise weighting and channel-wise weighting. After extracting the deep features, the chaos-based hash function will be proposed to generate a secure multi-modal template. The work will be implemented on the MATLAB platform, and the performance metrics of accuracy, precision, FPR, FNR, FAR, FRR, TPR, TNR and EER will be evaluated. The proposed method achieves an accuracy performance of 99.93, FAR is 0.11, FRR is 0.18, and EER is 0.15. The proposed method is compared with some existing methods to prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB Worms often aggregate through physical connections and exhibit remarkable functions such as efficient migration, survival under environmental changes, and defense against predators. In particular, entangled blobs demonstrate versatile behaviors for their survival; they form spherical blobs and migrate collectively by flexibly changing their shape in response to the environment. In contrast to previous studies on the collective behavior of worm blobs that focused on locomotion in a flat environment, we investigated the mechanisms underlying their adaptive motion in confined environments, focusing on tubificine worm collectives. We first performed several behavioral experiments to observe the aggregation process, collective response to aversive stimuli, the motion of a few worms, and blob motion in confined spaces with and without pegs. We found the blob deformed and passed through a narrow passage using environmental heterogeneities. Based on these behavioral findings, we constructed a simple two-dimensional agent-based model wherein the flexible body of a worm was described as a cross-shaped agent that could deform, rotate, and translate. The simulations demonstrated that the behavioral findings were well-reproduced. Our findings aid in understanding how physical interactions contribute to generating adaptive collective behaviors in real-world environments as well as in designing novel swarm robotic systems consisting of soft agents.

AB Time series forecasting is an important problem, with many real world applications. Transformer models have been successfully applied to natural language processing tasks, but have received relatively little attention for time series forecasting. Motivated by the differences between classification tasks and forecasting, we propose PI-Transformer, an adaptation of the Transformer architecture designed for time series forecasting, consisting of three parts: First, we propose a novel initialization method called Persistence Initialization, with the goal of increasing training stability of forecasting models by ensuring that the initial outputs of an untrained model are identical to the outputs of a simple baseline model. Second, we use ReZero normalization instead of Layer Normalization, in order to further tackle issues related to training stability. Third, we use Rotary positional encodings to provide a better inductive bias for forecasting. Multiple ablation studies show that the PI-Transformer is more accurate, learns faster, and scales better than regular Transformer models. Finally, PI-Transformer achieves competitive performance on the challenging M4 dataset, both when compared to the current state of the art, and to recently proposed Transformer models for time series forecasting.

TI Dense-scale dynamic network with filter-varying atrous convolution for
   semantic segmentation
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

   (DCNNs); Dynamic convolution
AB Deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs) in deep learning have been widely used in semantic segmentation. However, the filters of most regular convolutions in DCNNs are spatially invariant to local transformations, which reduces localization accuracy and hinders the improvement of semantic segmentation. Dynamic convolution with pixel-level filters can enhance the localization accuracy through its region-awareness, but these are sensitive to objects with large-scale variations in semantic segmentation. To simultaneously address the low localization accuracy and objects with large-scale variations, we propose a filter-varying atrous convolution (FAC) to efficiently enlarge the per-pixel receptive fields pertaining to various objects. FAC mainly consists of a conditional-filter-generating network (CFGN) and a dynamic local filtering operation (DLFO). In the CFGN, a class probability map is used to generate the corresponding filters, making the FAC genuinely dynamic. In the DLFO, by replacing the sliding convolution operation one by one with a one-time dot product operation, the efficiency of the algorithm is greatly improved. Also, a dense scale module (DSM) is constructed to generate denser scales and larger receptive fields for exploring long-range contextual information. Finally, a dense-scale dynamic network (DsDNet) simultaneously enhances the localization accuracy and reduces the effect of large-scale variations of the object, by assigning FAC to different spatial locations at dense scales. In addition, to accelerate network convergence and improve segmentation accuracy, our network employs two pixel-wise cross-entropy loss functions. One is between the Backbone and DSM, and the other is at the network's end. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC 2012, and ADE20K datasets verify that the performance of our DsDNet is superior to the non-dynamic and multi-scale convolution neural networks.

AB The spectral anomalies, limited training samples, and noisy training labels pose significant challenges to accurately classifying hyperspectral images (HSIs). To address these issues, we propose a novel dictionary cache transformer (DiCT) for HSIs classification, leveraging a combination of a group self-attention mechanism and a dictionary cache module. Specifically, the group self-attention mechanism binds the features local to the pixel into a group, thus alleviating the interference caused by pixel spectral anomalies. Furthermore, we capture representative structural information from different samples using their discriminative features to construct the dictionary cache module. The dictionary cache module enhances features by fusing sample features and the most similar element in the dictionary cache, thus improving the model's resilience to noisy training labels. Experiments on five HSIs datasets demonstrate the proposed DiCT's superiority in classification performance and robustness to noisy training labels.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Attributed network; Variational autoencoder; Normalization; Generative
   adversarial network
AB Attributed graph embedding aims to learn low-dimensional representations by fully exploiting both topological structure and rich attributes. The embeddings contain more useful information, thus yielding better performance in subsequent analysis tasks. Therefore, attributed network embedding has become an important research direction in recent years. However, most existing algorithms ignore the high-frequency noise contained in the features and do not normalize the embedding, which limits their performance in downstream tasks. To solve the above problem, we design an Adversarial Attributed Graph Embedding algorithm (AAGE) in conjunction with a Laplacian smoothing filter. In particular, the AAGE employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the embedding of nodes and attributes. Unlike most variational autoencoder-based algorithms, we first apply a carefully-designed Laplacian filter to smooth the features before performing autoencoder, secondly normalize the obtained embeddings of nodes and attributes during the autoencoder process, and finally devise a generative adversarial training method to enhance the robustness of the learned representations. To verify the potential of the proposed AAGE, we evaluate its performance on the tasks of node classification and node clustering on three real-world attributed networks. The results show that AAGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB Hand gesture recognition from images is a longstanding computer vision task that can be used to build a potential bridge for human-computer interaction and sign language translation. For number of methods proposed for hand gesture recognition (HGR); however, difficult scenarios such as different scales of hand gestures and complex backgrounds exist, making them less effective. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multiscale feature learning network for HGR, which consists of a CNN-based backbone network, a feature aggregation pyramid network (FAPN) embedded with a two-stage expansion-squeeze-aggregation (ESA) module, and three taskspecific prediction branches. First, the backbone network extracts multiscale features from the original hand gesture images. Furthermore, the FAPN embedded with two-stage ESA extensively exploits multiscale feature information and learns hand gesture-specific features at different scales. Then, the mask loss guides the network to locate hand-specific regions during the training stage, and finally, the classification and regression branches output the category and location of a hand gesture during the model training and prediction. The experimental results on two publicly available datasets show that the proposed method outperforms most state-of-the-art HGR methods.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Few-Shot learning; Few-Shot segmentation; Semantic segmentation;
   Prototype learning
AB Few-Shot segmentation (FSS) is a marginally explored but challenging task that aims to identify unseen classes of objects with only a handful of densely annotated samples. By and large, current FSS approaches perform meta-inference based on the prototype learning paradigm, which fails to fully exploit the underlying information from support image-mask pairs, resulting in multiple segmentation failures, such as incomplete objects, ambiguous boundaries, and distractor activation. For this purpose, a flexible and generic framework is developed in the spirit of divide-and-conquer. We first implement a novel self-reasoning scheme on the labeled support image, and then divide the coarse segmentation mask into several regions with different properties. By employing effective masked average pooling techniques, a series of support-induced proxies are generated on the fly, each performing a specific role in conquering the above challenges. Furthermore, we meticulously devise the parallel decoder structure and semantic consistency regularization to eliminate confusion and enhance discrimination. In stark contrast to conventional prototype-based approaches, our proposed divide-and-conquer proxies (DCP) can provide "episode" level guidelines that go well beyond the object cues themselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on FSS benchmarks to verify the effectiveness, including standard settings as well as cross-domain settings. In particular, we propose a temporal DCP and successfully extend it to video object segmentation via memory repository and progressive propagation, illustrating the high scalability. The source codes are available at https://github.com/chunbolang/DCP.

ID RECOGNITION; FRAMEWORK
AB With rapid advancements in depth sensors and deep learning, skeleton-based person re-identification (re-ID) models have recently achieved remarkable progress with many advantages. Most existing solutions learn single-level skeleton features from body joints with the assumption of equal skeleton importance, while they typically lack the ability to exploit more informative skeleton features from various levels such as limb level with more global body patterns. The label dependency of these methods also limits their flexibility in learning more general skeleton representations. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Hierarchical skeleton Meta-Prototype Contrastive learning (Hi-MPC) approach with Hard Skeleton Mining (HSM) for person re-ID with unlabeled 3D skeletons. Firstly, we construct hierarchical representations of skeletons to model coarse-to-fine body and motion features from the levels of body joints, components, and limbs. Then a hierarchical meta-prototype contrastive learning model is proposed to cluster and contrast the most typical skeleton features ("prototypes") from different-level skeletons. By converting original prototypes into meta-prototypes with multiple homogeneous transformations, we induce the model to learn the inherent consistency of prototypes to capture more effective skeleton features for person re-ID. Furthermore, we devise a hard skeleton mining mechanism to adaptively infer the informative importance of each skeleton, so as to focus on harder skeletons to learn more discriminative skeleton representations. Extensive evaluations on five datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods. We further show the general applicability of our method to cross-view person re-ID and RGB-based scenarios with estimated skeletons.

AB Lateral interaction in the biological brain is a key mechanism that underlies higher cognitive functions. Linear self-organising map (SOM) introduces lateral interaction in a general form in which signals of any modality can be used. Some approaches directly incorporate SOM learning rules into neural networks, but incur complex operations and poor extendibility. The efficient way to implement lateral interaction in deep neural networks is not well established. The use of Laplacian Matrix-based Smoothing (LS) regularisation is proposed for implementing lateral interaction in a concise form. The authors' derivation and experiments show that lateral interaction implemented by SOM model is a special case of LS-regulated k-means, and they both show the topology-preserving capability. The authors also verify that LS-regularisation can be used in conjunction with the end-to-end training paradigm in deep auto-encoders. Additionally, the benefits of LS-regularisation in relaxing the requirement of parameter initialisation in various models and improving the classification performance of prototype classifiers are evaluated. Furthermore, the topologically ordered structure introduced by LS-regularisation in feature extractor can improve the generalisation performance on classification tasks. Overall, LS-regularisation is an effective and efficient way to implement lateral interaction and can be easily extended to different models.

AB Multiple events in a long untrimmed video possess the characteristics of similarity and continuity. These characteristics can be considered as a kind of topic semantic information, which probably behaves as same sports, similar scenes, same objects etc. Inspired by this, a novel latent topic-aware network (LTNet) is proposed in this article. The LTNet explores potential themes within videos and generates more continuous captions. Firstly, a global visual topic finder is employed to detect the similarity among events and obtain latent topic-level features. Secondly, a latent topic-oriented relation learner is designed to further enhance the topic-level representations by capturing the relationship between each event and the video themes. Benefiting from the finder and the learner, the caption generator is capable of predicting more accurate and coherent descriptions. The effectiveness of our proposed method is demonstrated on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2 datasets, where LTNet shows a relative performance of over 3.03% and 0.50% in CIDEr score respectively.

AB The problem of picking a sequence of items that maximizes a given submodular function over the item sequence exists in many practical applications. Existing studies on this problem only consider uniform costs on items. However, it is more general that items have non-uniform costs. Taking this cue, in this article, we study the problem of budgeted sequence submodular maximization (BSSM), which considers both uniform and non-uniform item costs in the sequence selection. This problem widely appears in many applications such as movie recommendation and course learning. For BSSM with uniform costs, we first prove a new approximation ratio for an existing algorithm OMEGA, and then propose an anytime randomized iterative algorithm POBM which converges faster than a state-of-the-art method POSEQSEL in obtaining approximate solutions. We also develop some optimization techniques for improving the efficiency of POBM. For BSSM with non-uniform costs, we design a greedy algorithm GBM with a guaranteed error bound, and prove that POBM can find approximate solutions in a reasonable time. The results of the experimental study on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our algorithms.

AB RDF compression and querying are consolidated topics in the Web of Data, with a plethora of solutions to efficiently store and query static datasets. However, as RDF data changes along time, it becomes necessary to keep different versions of RDF datasets, in what is called an RDF archive. For large RDF datasets, naive techniques to store these versions lead to significant scalability problems. In this paper, we present v-RDF-SI, one of the first RDF archiving solutions that aim at joining both compression and fast querying. In v-RDF-SI, we extend existing RDF representations based on compact data structures to provide efficient support of version-based queries in compressed space. We present two implementations of v-RDF-SI, named v-RDFCSA and v-HDT, based, respectively, on RDFCSA (an RDF self-index) and HDT (a W3C-supported compressed RDF representation). We experimentally evaluate v-RDF-SI over a public benchmark named BEAR, showing that v-RDF-SI drastically reduces space requirements, being up to 40 times smaller than the baselines provided by BEAR, and 4 times smaller than alternatives based on compact data structures, while yielding significantly faster query times in most cases. On average, the fastest variants of v-RDF-SI outperform the alternatives by almost an order of magnitude.

AB Background. Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease, and early detection of skin cancer improves the chances of recovery. Skin cancer detection based on deep learning algorithms has recently grown popular. In this research, a new deep learning-based network model for the multiple skin cancer classification including melanoma, benign keratosis, melanocytic nevi, and basal cell carcinoma is presented. We propose an automatic Multi-class Skin Cancer Detection Network (MSCD-Net) model in this research.Methods. The study proposes an efficient semantic segmentation deep learning model "DenseUNet"for skin lesion segmentation. The semantic skin lesions are segmented by using the DenseUNet model with a substantially deeper network and fewer trainable parameters. Some of the most relevant features are selected using Binary Dragonfly Algorithm (BDA). SqueezeNet-based classification can be made in the selected features Results. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated using the ISIC 2019 dataset. The DenseNet connections and UNet links are used by the proposed DenseUNet segmentation model, which produces low-level features and provides better segmentation results. The performance results of the proposed MSCD-Net model are superior to previous research in terms of effectiveness and efficiency on the standard ISIC 2019 dataset.

AB The use of offensive terms in user-generated content on different social media platforms is one of the major concerns for these platforms. The offensive terms have a negative impact on individuals, which may lead towards the degradation of societal and civilized manners. The immense amount of content generated at a higher speed makes it humanly impossible to categorise and detect offensive terms. Besides, it is an open challenge for natural language processing (NLP) to detect such terminologies automatically. Substantial efforts are made for high-resource languages such as English. However, it becomes more challenging when dealing with resource-poor languages such as Urdu. Because of the lack of standard datasets and pre-processing tools for automatic offensive terms detection. This paper introduces a combinatorial preprocessing approach in developing a classification model for cross-platform (Twitter and YouTube) use. The approach uses datasets from two different platforms (Twitter and YouTube) the training and testing the model, which is trained to apply decision tree, random forest and naive Bayes algorithms. The proposed combinatorial pre-processing approach is applied to check how machine learning models behave with different combinations of standard pre-processing techniques for low-resource language in the cross-platform setting. The experimental results represent the effectiveness of the machine learning model over different subsets of traditional pre-processing approaches in building a classification model for automatic offensive terms detection for a low resource language, i.e., Urdu, in the cross-platform scenario. In the experiments, when dataset D1 is used for training and D2 is applied for testing, the pre-processing approach named Stopword removal produced better results with an accuracy of 83.27%. Whilst, in this case, when dataset D2 is used for training and D1 is applied for testing, stopword removal and punctuation removal were observed as a better preprocessing approach with an accuracy of 74.54%. The combinatorial approach proposed in this paper outperformed the benchmark for the considered datasets using classical as well as ensemble machine learning with an accuracy of 82.9% and 97.2% for dataset D1 and D2, respectively.

AB Due to the growing competition of firms in manufacturing industries, the enhancement of the design of new products for quick and collaborative interaction of stakeholders is inevitable. A customer-oriented approach during the enhancing of product design requires the support of various stakeholders' collaboration from their functionality perspectives. Accordingly, manufacturing firms try to increase the product quality through the continuous collaboration and speeding up of the design process. Moreover, new manufacturing paradigms like cloud manufacturing require global and distributed collaboration of stakeholders. One competitive key necessity for firms is the integration of stakeholders in the design and production stages. This article has proposed an interactive and integrated framework for a cloud collaborative manufacturing system. The proposed framework uses the international STEP standard which ensures data integrity in the whole product development processes. The framework enables stakeholders to work collaboratively and interactively in their disciplines, while it also ensures coherency of modifications to avoid conflicts. The proposed model is introduced using an improvisational design method based on the STEP standard to create an interactive platform with a service oriented approach and supports stakeholders for their own semantics. In addition to examining the needs of an interactive system, the article provides an architecture for implementation of this perspective. A comprehensive case study is designed to show the capabilities of the proposed framework.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks formed by organizing and combining tens of thousands of sensor nodes freely through wireless communication technology. WSNs are commonly affected by various attacks, such as identity theft, black holes, wormholes, protocol spoofing, etc. As one of the more severe threats, wormholes create passive attacks that are hard to detect and eliminate. Since WSN is often used in the tactical network field, a planned secure network is essential for military applications with high security. Guard nodes are traffic monitoring nodes used to supervise neighbors' data communication around the tactical networks. Therefore, this work proposes a Quality of Service (QoS) security mechanism to select multiple dual-layer guard nodes at different paths of the WSN based on the path qualities to detect wormholes. The entire network's links are categorized into high, normal, and low priority levels. As such, this study aimed to confirm the security of high priority nodes and links in the tactical network, avoid excessive overhead, and provide random security facilities to all nodes. The proposed measures of the QoS-based security provision, including link cluster formation, guard node selection, authenticated guard node identification, and intrusion detection, ensure economic and efficient network communication with different quality levels.

AB A digitized rigid motion is called digitally continuous if two neighbor pixels still stay neighbors after the motion. This concept plays important role when people or computers (artificial intelligence, machine vision) need to recognize the object shown in the image. In this paper, digital rotations of a pixel with its closest neighbors are of our interest. We compare the neighborhood motion map results among the three regular grids, when the center of rotation is the midpoint of a main pixel, a grid point (corner of a pixel) or an edge midpoint. The first measure about the quality of digital rotations is based on bijectivity, e.g., measuring how many of the cases produce bijective and how many produce not bijective neighborhood motion maps (Avkan et. al, 2022). Now, a second measure is investigated, the quality of bijective digital rotations is measured by the digital continuity of the resulted image: we measure how many of the cases are bijective and also digitally continuous. We show that rotations on the triangular grid prove to be digitally continuous at many more real angles and also as a special case, many more integer angles compared to the square grid or to the hexagonal grid with respect to the three different rotation centers.

   Multimodal recommendation; Contrastive learning
AB The multimodal side information such as images and text have been commonly used as supplements to improve graph collaborative filtering recommendations. However, there is often a semantic gap between multimodal information and collaborative filtering information. Previous works often directly fuse or align these information, which results in semantic distortion or degradation. Additionally, multimodal information also introduces additional noises, and previous methods lack explicit supervision to identify these noises. To tackle the issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach to improve graph collaborative filtering, named Multimodal-Side-Information-enriched Contrastive Learning (MSICL), which does not fuse multimodal information directly, but still explicitly captures users' potential preferences for similar images or text by contrasting ID embeddings, and filters noises in multimodal side information. Specifically, we first search for samples with similar images or text as positive contrastive pairs. Secondly, some searched sample pairs may be irrelevant, so we distinguish the noise by filtering out sample pairs that have no interaction relationship. Thirdly, we contrast the ID embeddings of the true positive sample pairs to excavate the potential similarity relationship in multimodal side information. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in multimodal recommendation. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces computation and memory cost compared to previous work.

AB Object detection is a key technology to realize the blind inspection of industrial products. To improve the automation degree of building deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection and further improve the detection accuracy, this paper proposes an improved neural architecture search method using exclusive-OR (XOR)-based channel feature fusion. First, an XOR-based channel fusion module is designed; it can fuse the feature mapping of different scales at the channel level in the case of multibranch access complementarily. Then, an improved cell pruning strategy is proposed to efficiently prune the connections between cells by setting the architecture parameters of the candidate operations to 0 s, which are in the alignment layers of the subsequent cells. The cell pruning strategy can directly search the multibranch CNN models and narrow the neural network architectures' gap between the search stage and the evaluation stage. The experimental results show that the proposed method takes approximately 0.75 GPU days to search the optimal neural network on a dataset including six classes for blind inspection of industrial products, and the mean average precision (mAP) is approximately 99.1% on a test dataset, which is higher than those of state-of-the-art methods, e.g., DenseNAS and CSPDarknet53.

AB The research focus in the field of combinatorial testing has shifted from unconstrained covering array generation (CAG) to constrained covering array generation (CCAG). Most heuristic search algorithms exclude all invalid solutions from the search space so that all intermediate and final solutions satisfy the constraints. However, some values of intermediate solutions that are sometimes invalid may help in finding the optimal solution. Therefore, such solutions may need to be "tolerated" in the generation process. This paper proposes a tolerance-based memetic algorithm named QSMA that employs quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) as a global searching operator and improved simulated annealing as a local searching operator to balance exploration and exploitation synergistically. Meanwhile, QSMA incorporates a stochastic ranking strategy to address the challenge of setting the penalty coefficient. Besides, a specific penalty function is proposed to deal with constraints, and design guidelines for penalty functions are suggested. In the experiment, the impacts of parameter settings on the performance of QSMA are investigated. Extensive experimental results show that the QSMA algorithm outperforms other methods and tools for both CAG and CCAG problems.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING CONTROL
AB Today, robotic arms are widely used in industry. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used frequently for controlling robotic arms in complex environments. One of the customs off-policy model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning for continuous action spaces is deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). This algorithm has achieved significant results when applied to control robotic arms with high degrees of freedom. But, it also has limitations. DDPG is prone to instability and divergence in complex tasks due to the high dimensional continuous action spaces. In this paper, in order to increase the reliability and convergence speed of the DDPG algorithm, a new modified convergence DDPG (MCDDPG) algorithm is presented. By saving and reusing desirable parameters of the previous actor and critic networks, the proposed algorithm has shown a significant enhancement in training time and stability of the model compared to the conventional DDPG. We evaluate our method on the PR2's right arm which is a 7-DoF manipulator, and simulations demonstrate that our MCDDPG outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as DDPG and normalized advantage function in learning complex robotic tasks.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DE Image classification; Self/semi-supervised learning; Adversarial
   training; Embedding expansion
AB Consistency regularization (CR) is representative semi-supervised learning (SSL) technique that maintains the consistency of predictions from multiple views on the same unlabeled data during the training. In recent SSL studies, the approaches of self-supervised learning with CR, which conducts the pre-training based on unsupervised learning and fine-tuning based on supervised learning, have provided excellent classification accuracy. However, the data augmentation used to generate multiple views in CR has a limitation for expanding the training data distribution. In addition, the existing self-supervised learning using CR cannot provide the high-density clustering result for each class of the labeled data in a representation space, thus it is vulnerable to outlier samples of the unlabeled data with strong augmentation. Consequently, the unlabeled data with augmentation for SSL may not improve the classification performance but rather degrade it. To solve these, we propose a new training methodology called adversarial representation teaching (ART), which consists of the labeled sample-guided representation teaching and adversarial noise-based CR. In our method, the adversarial attack-robust teacher model guides the student model to form a high-density distribution in representation space. This allows for maximizing the improvement by the strong embedding augmentation in the student model for SSL. For the embedding augmentation, the adversarial noise attack on the representation is proposed to successfully expand a class-wise subspace, which cannot be achieved by the existing adversarial attack or embedding expansion. Experimental results showed that the proposed method provided outstanding classification accuracy up to 1.57% compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods under SSL conditions. Moreover, ART significantly outperforms the classification accuracies up to 1.57%, 0.53%, and 0.3% over our baseline method on the CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets, respectively.

   instance learning
AB Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention in recent years, as it utilizes only image-level annotations to train object detectors and greatly reduces the labor and capital cost of fine labeling. Nevertheless, the absence of instance-level annotations leads to two phenomena: partial regions and missing instances. We believe these are mainly caused by two issues: 1) Noisy instances exist in the training samples, which can confuse the detector. 2) Global salient information is missing, resulting in little attention being received in the low-confidence region. To solve the above two problems, we propose an instance dual-optimization framework called IDO. First, an instance-wise selection strategy (IWSS) based on curriculum learning is proposed for instance denoising and for improving the robustness of the model. Second, CAM-generated spatial attention (CGSA) is carefully designed to optimize the features of instances. Without introducing additional hyperparameters, our CGSA complements the low class-confidence region with more global salient information, which assists the model in acquiring a more complete region of the target and identifying more neglected targets. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that our proposal can achieve comparable results to those of other state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and MS COCO.

ID SERIES CLASSIFICATION
AB Recently, contrastive learning (CL) is a promising way of learning discriminative representations from time series data. In the representation hierarchy, semantic information extracted from lower levels is the basis of that captured from higher levels. Low-level semantic information is essential and should be considered in the CL process. However, the existing CL algorithms mainly focus on the similarity of high-level semantic information. Considering the similarity of low-level semantic information may improve the performance of CL. To this end, we present a deep contrastive representation learning with self-distillation (DCRLS) for the time series domain. DCRLS gracefully combine data augmentation, deep contrastive learning, and self distillation. Our data augmentation provides different views from the same sample as the input of DCRLS. Unlike most CL algorithms that concentrate on high-level semantic information only, our deep contrastive learning also considers the contrast similarity of low-level semantic information between peer residual blocks. Our self distillation promotes knowledge flow from high-level to low-level blocks to help regularize DCRLS in the knowledge transfer process. The experimental results demonstrate that the DCRLS-based structures achieve excellent performance on classification and clustering on 36 UCR2018 datasets.

AB The image-to-video (I2V) person re-identification (Re-ID) is a cross-modality pedestrian retrieval task, whose crux is to reduce the large modality discrepancy between images and videos. To this end, this paper proposes to predict the following video frames from a single image. Thus, the I2V person Re-ID can be transformed to video-to-video (V2V) Re-ID. Considering that predicting video frames from a single image is an ill-posed problem, this paper proposes two strategies to improve the quality of the predicted videos. First, a pose-guided video prediction pipeline is proposed. The given single image and pedestrian pose are encoded via image encoder and pose encoder, respectively; then, the image feature and pose feature are concatenated as the input of the video decoder. The authors minimize the difference between the predicted video and true video, and simultaneously minimize the difference between the true pose and predicted pose. Second, the conditional adversarial training strategy is employed to generate high-quality video frames. Specifically, the discriminator takes the source image as condition and distinguishes whether the input frames are fake or true following frames of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that the pose-guided adversarial video prediction can effectively improve accuracy of I2V Re-ID.
   This paper focuses on image-to-video (I2V) person re-identification (Re-ID). This paper proposes to predict the following video frames from a single image. Thus, the I2V person Re-ID can be transformed to video-to-video Re-ID.image

AB To promote consumers' active participation in the shared economy, it is mandatory to enhance the users' sense of experience, and provide a valuable reference for business operators. This paper aims to conduct in-depth research on how customer behavior is affected by the perception of customers in a shared economic environment. This study develops a research model to examine the effect of customer-perceived value on consumer behavior using the shared car as an example and introduces the definition of customer-perceived value variables and variable measurement in detail. In this study, we proposed a questionnaire design and pre-test, after which the research model was modified accordingly. Following the development of the conceptual model of perceived value, a quantitative approach to user cognitive assessment based on fuzzy logic is recommended. The subjective nature of the perceptions collected from various consumers is transformed into fuzzy values using fuzzy logic, and using a membership function, these fuzzy values are linked to a fuzzy set. Then, these fuzzy values are deduced using a comprehensive evaluation model, which is part of our whole proposed model for customer-perceived value evaluation. A comparative analysis of the experimental results is carried out, which shows the method proposed in this paper has high reliability and innovation and can effectively enhance the user's sense of experience.

AB This paper proposes the sky-signature model, an extension of the signature model Gautrais et al. (in: Proceedings of the Pacific-Asia conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (PAKDD), Springer, 2017b) to multi-objective optimization. The signature approach considers a sequence of itemsets, and given a number k it returns a segmentation of the sequence in k segments such that the number of items occuring in all segments is maximized. The limitation of this approach is that it requires to manually set k, and thus fixes the temporal granularity at which the data is analyzed. The sky-signature model proposed in this paper removes this requirement, and allows to examine the results at multiple levels of granularity, while keeping a compact output. This paper also proposes efficient algorithms to mine sky-signatures, as well as an experimental validation both real data both from the retail domain and from natural language processing (political speeches).

AB In recent times, with the exception of sporadic cases, the trend in computer vision is to achieve minor improvements compared to considerable increases in complexity. To reverse this trend, we propose a novel method to boost image classification performances without increasing complexity. To this end, we revisited ensembling, a powerful approach, often not used properly due to its more complex nature and the training time, so as to make it feasible through a specific design choice. First, we trained two EfficientNet-b0 end-to-end models (known to be the architecture with the best overall accuracy/complexity trade-off for image classification) on disjoint subsets of data (i.e., bagging). Then, we made an efficient adaptive ensemble by performing fine-tuning of a trainable combination layer. In this way, we were able to outperform the state-of-the-art by an average of 0.5% on the accuracy, with restrained complexity both in terms of the number of parameters (by 5-60 times), and the FLoating point Operations Per Second FLOPS by 10-100 times on several major benchmark datasets.

AB Model transparency, label correlation learning and robustness to label noise are crucial for multilabel learning. However, few existing methods consider these three characteristics simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose the robust multilabel Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (R-MLTSK-FS) with three mechanisms. First, we design a soft label learning mechanism to reduce the effect of label noise by explicitly measuring the interactions between labels, which is also the basis of the other two mechanisms. Second, rule-based multi-output TSK FS is used as the base model to efficiently model the inference relationship between features and soft labels in a more transparent way than many existing multilabel models. Third, to further improve the performance of multilabel learning, we build a correlation enhancement learning mechanism based on the soft label space and the fuzzy feature space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

AB The plastic injection moulding industry has been growing and expanding rapidly. Cost evaluation is important to business operations and numerous aspects influence part pricing. However, the intricacy of production data often includes distinctive factors that result in inaccurate and a long waiting time. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a cost evaluation approach that combines a 3-dimension convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) with an artificial neural network (ANN) to improve the accuracy of complex geometry from a dense voxel of convolutional neural network (CNN) that can disentangle the difficulty of primary cost evaluation. The methodology consists of 3D-voxelization adopted to 3-dimension convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and the feature extraction of complex geometry to feature parameters using the learning ability of artificial neural network (ANN) to achieve better accuracy. Then, bulk price analysis is developed for multi-price in-depth for multi-volumes. These results can predict cost evaluation at about 98.65% accuracy for parts costs, 95.17% accuracy for mould costs, and 96.83% of multi-price for multi-volume. The contribution of this research is based upon a new hybrid deep learning using 3-dimension convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) with artificial neural network (ANN) that is practical and accurate in performing cost evaluation multi-prices for multi-volumes for decision-making in the plastic injection industry.

AB It is of great significance to identify all types of domestic garbage quickly and intelligently to improve people's quality of life. Based on the visual analysis of feature map changes in different neural networks, a Skip-YOLO model is proposed for real-life garbage detection, targeting the problem of recognizing garbage with similar features. First, the receptive field of the model is enlarged through the large-size convolution kernel which enhanced the shallow information of images. Second, the high-dimensional features of the garbage maps are extracted by dense convolutional blocks. The sensitivity of similar features in the same type of garbage increases by strengthening the sharing of shallow low semantics and deep high semantics information. Finally, multiscale high-dimensional feature maps are integrated and routed to the YOLO layer for predicting garbage type and location. The overall detection accuracy is increased by 22.5% and the average recall rate is increased by 18.6% comparing the experimental results with the YOLOv3 analysis. In qualitative comparison, it successfully detects domestic garbage in complex multi-scenes. In addition, this approach alleviates the overfitting problem of deep residual blocks. The application case of waste sorting production line is used to further highlight the model generalization performance of the method.

AB In many related studies, educational data mining technology has been proven to play an important role in predicting the development direction of entrepreneurship education for college students. To further improve the accuracy of the prediction, we chose the grey prediction model as the basic prediction model and automatically optimized the weighting method to improve the model. To solve the problem of predicting the development direction of students' employment in the guidance of entrepreneurship and employment in colleges and universities, the study selects the grey prediction model as the basic prediction model and chooses the automatic optimization and weighting method to improve the model. Meanwhile, the study establishes a variable system containing six dimensions: academic achievement; physical and mental development; cultural, physical, and artistic quantified status; ideological and political quantified status; scientific and technological innovation quantified status; social work quantified status. The final study used the actual prediction test to analyze the prediction effect. We have selected a variable system consisting of six dimensions, which are the results of extensive research. These dimensions include academic achievement, physical and mental development, cultural/sports/art quantitative status, ideological and political quantitative status, technological innovation quantitative status, and social work quantitative status. Each dimension provides us with important predictions about student entrepreneurship and employment. The results show that the model designed by the survey has only two cases of error in the prediction of 20 actual samples. At the same time, there is no prediction error in the two prediction directions of entrepreneurship and social employment. This shows that the model designed by the study is stable and accurate, and the prediction results are more reliable in the prediction directions of entrepreneurship and social employment. Compared with other relevant research results, our model performs well in predicting accuracy, especially in predicting entrepreneurial and social employment directions, without any prediction errors, indicating that our model has superior performance in predicting stability and accuracy compared to other studies.

AB Kernel-based reinforcement learning has received increasing attention because it requires less prior knowledge linear approximation and neural networks. Online kernel-based updating, however, is hindered by the challenge of catastrophic forgetting or interference. Sparse representation is a key method to address this issue, but existing methods fail to satisfy four criteria: learnability, nonprior, nontruncation, and explicitness. In this paper, we present an attentive kernel-based value function approximation as a learnable, nonprior, nontruncated, and explicit sparse representation. We propose the online attentive kernel-based temporal difference (OAKTD) algorithm, which employs twotimescale optimization, and provide a convergence analysis for our proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that OAKTD outperforms online kernel-based TD learning algorithms, and the TD learning algorithm with Tile Coding on classical tasks, i.e., Mountain Car, Acrobot, CartPole and Puddle World.

AB A composite control method based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is developed to solve the profile tracking problem of the hypersonic gliding vehicle (HGV) with multiple constraints (flight and input constraints). First, based on the framework of the standard profile guidance method, a standard drag acceleration-velocity profile is planned as the tracking target, which satisfies the flight constraints. Second, a composite controller based on ADP and dynamic surface control (DSC) is proposed to track the planned profile and satisfy both the terminal conditions and the input constraint. An ADP method is developed to realize the optimal control through a critic neural network (NN) approximation for the solution of Hamilton- Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By using DSC method, the steady control is realized. Finally, the states of the closed-loop system and the weight estimation error are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded, and the effectiveness of the proposed composite control method is verified via simulations.

AB Surgical cases assignment problem (SCAP) is among the most investigated interests in operating room planning. The studies related to the SCAP are mainly focused on the single objective optimization. To concern multiple criteria in the management, this paper reformulates a multi-objective SCAP with minimizing total operating cost and maximizing scheduled surgeries number, simultaneously. Although dozens of multi-objective methods have been introduced in recent years, these cannot be applied into the multi-objective SCAP directly considering the characteristics of the problem. To tackle the multi-objective SCAP, a problem-specified multi-objective squirrel search algorithm (MOSSA) is presented. First, a targeted single-list scheme is devised to encode individuals and an efficient decoding scheme integrating a repair strategy is proposed to construct feasible scheduling plan. Second, two simple heuristics are incorporated into the algorithm to imitate the behaviors of squirrels and improve the search ability. Third, an addition archive is employed to store the non-dominated solutions. Moreover, a DOE method is performed to investigate the influence of parameter settings. The performance of the MOSSA is assessed by a representative benchmark dataset with three different evaluating indicators. Extensive experiments and analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the superiority over compared approaches in addressing the multi-objective SCAP.

AB An urban traffic light scheduling problem (UTLSP) is studied by using problem feature based meta heuristics with Q-learning. The goal is to minimize the network-wise total delay time within a time window by finding a high-quality schedule of traffic lights. First, a dynamic flow model is used to describe the UTLSP in a scheduling framework. Second, four improved meta-heuristics combining Q learning are proposed, including harmony search (HS), water cycle algorithm (WCA), Jaya, and artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithms. Five problem feature based local search operators are constructed. During the iterative process, Q-learning is employed to select the local search operators with strong competitiveness. Two ensemble strategies are proposed to combine meta-heuristics and Q-learning. Finally, experiments are conducted based on real traffic data. The performance of the improved meta-heuristics with Q-learning is verified by solving eighteen cases with different scales. Numerical results and comparisons show that the proposed algorithms have statistical improvements over their peers. The proposed feature-based ABC with Q-learning has the strongest competitiveness among all compared ones.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many real-world multi-label applications, the content of multi-label data is usually characterized by high dimensional features, which contains complex correlation information, i.e., label correlations and redundant features. To alleviate the problem, we present a novel scheme, called learning correlation information for multi-label feature selection (LCIFS) method, by jointly digging up label correlations and controlling feature redundancy. To be specific, the regression model via manifold framework is presented to fit the relationship between feature space and label distribution, during which adaptive spectral graph is leveraged to learn more precise structural correlations of labels simultaneously. Besides, we utilize the relevance of features to constrain the redundancy of the generated feature subset, and a general l(2,p)-norm regularized model is employed to fulfill more robust feature selection. The proposed method is transformed into an explicit optimization function, which is conquered by an efficient iterative optimization algorithm. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on twelve realistic multi-label datasets, including text domain, image domain, and audio domain. The statistic results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method among nine competition methods.

ID METHODOLOGY
AB It has become progressively more evident that a single data source is unable to comprehensively capture the variability of a multi-faceted concept, such as product design, driving behaviour or human trust, which has diverse semantic orientations. Therefore, multi-faceted conceptual modelling is often conducted based on multisourced data covering indispensable aspects, and information fusion is frequently applied to cope with the high dimensionality and data heterogeneity. The consideration of intra-facets relationships is also indispensable. In this context, a knowledge graph (KG), which can aggregate the relationships of multiple aspects by semantic associations, was exploited to facilitate the multi-faceted conceptual modelling based on heterogeneous and semantic-rich data. Firstly, rules of fault mechanism are extracted from the existing domain knowledge repository, and node attributes are extracted from multi-sourced data. Through abstraction and tokenisation of existing knowledge repository and concept-centric data, rules of fault mechanism were symbolised and integrated with the node attributes, which served as the entities for the concept-centric knowledge graph (CKG). Subsequently, the transformation of process data to a stack of temporal graphs was conducted under the CKG backbone. Lastly, the graph convolutional network (GCN) model was applied to extract temporal and attribute correlation features from the graphs, and a temporal convolution network (TCN) was built for conceptual modelling using these features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the close synergy between the KG-supported approach and multi-faceted conceptual modelling is demonstrated and substantiated in a case study using real-world data.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Robot task planning; LLM code generation; Planning domain

AB Task planning can require defining myriad domain knowledge about the world in which a robot needs to act. To ameliorate that effort, large language models (LLMs) can be used to score potential next actions during task planning, and even generate action sequences directly, given an instruction in natural language with no additional domain information. However, such methods either require enumerating all possible next steps for scoring, or generate free-form text that may contain actions not possible on a given robot in its current context. We present a programmatic LLM prompt structure that enables plan generation functional across situated environments, robot capabilities, and tasks. Our key insight is to prompt the LLM with program-like specifications of the available actions and objects in an environment, as well as with example programs that can be executed. We make concrete recommendations about prompt structure and generation constraints through ablation experiments, demonstrate state of the art success rates in VirtualHome household tasks, and deploy our method on a physical robot arm for tabletop tasks.

However, DNNs suffer from a fundamental issue: their lack of interpretability. While this is true for most applications of DNNs, this is exacerbated in their applications in MARL. In fact, the mutual interactions between agents and environment, as well as across agents, make it particularly difficult to understand learned strategies in these settings. One possible way to achieve explainability in MARL is through the use of interpretable models, such as decision trees, that allow for a direct inspection and understanding of their inner workings. In this work, we make a step forward in this direction, proposing a population based algorithm that combines evolutionary principles with RL for training interpretable models in multi-agent systems. We evaluate the proposed approach in a highly dynamic task where two teams of agents compete with each other. We test different variants of the proposed method in different settings, namely with/without coevolution and with/without initialization from a handcrafted policy. We find that, in most settings, our method is able to find fairly effective policies. Moreover, we show that the learned policies are easy to inspect and, possibly, interpreted based on domain knowledge.

AB Nowadays, green manufacturing is an increasingly significant theme in the worldwide industry fields. System integration can fully exploit the potential of subsystems to achieve satisfying green and low-carbon manufacturing. In particular, integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) can obtain better process routes and scheduling schemes to realize more efficient and less energy-consuming production by utilizing the complementary attributes of the process and scheduling subsystems. Additional consideration of the shop logistics system including task assignment of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) can improve shop productivity while ensuring the smooth running of the whole manufacturing system. Taking into account AGV transportation, this paper studies a green multi-objective IPPS problem considering logistics system (MO_IPPS_LS) to minimize the maximum completion time and energy consumption simultaneously. A multi-population co-evolutionary algorithm (MPCEA) is proposed with a novel integrated encoding method. The co-evolutionary framework can ensure the diversity of the populations through a backtracking mechanism and different evolutionary operators including modified critical-path based local searching. The proposed MPCEA is tested on the open benchmarks with different proportions of transport resources. The comparative experimental results show the effectiveness and superiority of MPCEA for solving MO_IPPS_LS problem.

AB This paper proposes a real-time human inverse kinematics approach based on the Gaussian Process (GP) to address the open problem of finding appropriate inverse kinematic solutions for upper-limb rehabilitation using redundant robotic exoskeletons. The proposed approach is validated using recorded data from a Motion Capture (MoCap) system and is shown to achieve accurate and unique upper-limb natural solutions for different rehabilitation exercises. This approach is a computationally tractable alternative to existing solutions, which are not always feasible and unsuitable for real-time rehabilitation tests, as they are based on optimizing discomfort indices online or computationally demanding learning methods. A comparison with existing inverse kinematics solutions confirms the superior performance of the proposed approach. Additionally, a robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) with an Integral Sliding Mode (ISM) combination is proposed for safe trajectory tracking during rehabilitation exercises. Several real-time experiments were conducted on a 7-DoF exoskeleton robot with and without the presence of a healthy subject to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB The class imbalance problem significantly hinders the ability of the software defect prediction (SDP) models to distinguish between defective (minority class) and non-defective (majority class) software instances. Recent studies on the data resampling technique have shown that Random UnderSampling (RUS) is more effective than several complex oversampling techniques at alleviating this problem. However, RUS blindly removes majority class instances, leading to significant information loss. These studies have also pointed out that the conventional termination condition (i.e., terminating the data resampling technique when the number of instances for both the minority and majority classes are the same) of the data resampling technique can result in suboptimal performance. In fact, the undersampling technique can be likened to a recommender system or a web search engine that recommends majority class instances to SDP models. Therefore, we propose the Learning-To-Rank Undersampling technique (LTRUS). Our work is novel in two aspects: (1) We consider the undersampling process as a learning-to-rank task, optimizing a linear model to rank majority class instances and remove them from the bottom of the rank to alleviate the class imbalance problem. (2) We propose two termination conditions for the undersampling technique, which differ from the conventional termination condition. LTRUS significantly outperforms RUS, the clustering-based undersampling technique, the complexity-based oversampling technique, SMOTUNED, and Borderline-SMOTE in terms of F-measure, AUC, and MCC by 8.9%, 7.6%, and 18.0% on average under the conventional termination condition. Furthermore, LTRUS under the two termination conditions we propose yield similar performance, and both outperform LTRUS and all the other baselines under the conventional termination condition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LTRUS and indicate that the conventional termination condition for the data resampling technique is improper.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic, a global contagion of coronavirus infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has triggered severe social and economic disruption around the world and provoked changes in people's behavior. Given the extreme societal impact of COVID-19, it becomes crucial to understand the emotional response of the people and the impact of COVID-19 on personality traits and psychological dimensions. In this study, we contribute to this goal by thoroughly analyzing the evolution of personality and psychological aspects in a large-scale collection of tweets extracted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objectives of this research are: i) to provide evidence that helps to understand the estimated impact of the pandemic on people's temperament, ii) to find associations and trends between specific events (e.g., stages of harsh confinement) and people's reactions, and iii) to study the evolution of multiple personality aspects, such as the degree of introversion or the level of neuroticism. We also examine the development of emotions, as a natural complement to the automatic analysis of the personality dimensions. To achieve our goals, we have created two large collections of tweets (geotagged in the United States and Spain, respectively), collected during the pandemic. Our work reveals interesting trends in personality dimensions, emotions, and events. For example, during the pandemic period, we found increasing traces of introversion and neuroticism. Another interesting insight from our study is that the most frequent signs of personality disorders are those related to depression, schizophrenia, and narcissism. We also found some peaks of negative/positive emotions related to specific events.

AB Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the most effective methods for single-objective numerical optimization, however, the former state-of-the-art DE variants ignore the huge differences among the individuals in the population. To take full advantage of different individuals in the population, in this paper, a dynamic Hierarchical Population based Differential Evolution (HPDE) with novel diversity metric is proposed, and the HPDE algorithm has the following innovations: Firstly, the individuals in the hierarchical population are dynamically divided into two layers, the layer of elites, and the layer of ordinary individuals. Moreover, the ordinary layer individuals are further divided into secondary elites and inferior individuals. The individuals in the two layers employed different mutation strategies and the corresponding parameter control schemes. Secondly, a novel hierarchical population based mutation strategy is firstly proposed in our HPDE algorithm and the individuals in the elite layer employ the novel mutation strategy aiming at scouting the landscape of the objective while the ordinary individuals employ an improved "DE/target-pbest/1/bin"strategy aiming at getting a better balance between exploration and exploitation of the solution space. Thirdly, a Novel Parameter Control technique, namely NPC technique, is employed in the adaptation of control parameters during the evolution. Fourthly, a new metric of population diversity is proposed and premature convergence can be avoided by maintaining better population diversity. To evaluate the performance of our HPDE algorithm, intensive experiments are conducted on 88 benchmark functions from the CEC2013, CEC2014 and CEC2017 test suites, and the results show the competitiveness of our HPDE with six recent state-of-the-art DE variants, e.g. it obtained 28 similar or better performance improvements out of the total 30 benchmarks on 30D optimization in comparison with the winner algorithm, the LSHADE algorithm, of the CEC2014 competition and it also obtained 19 similar or better performance improvements out of the total 30 benchmarks on 30D optimization in comparison with the winner DE variant, the jSO algorithm, of the CEC2017 competition. Furthermore, the novel HPDE algorithm is utilized to estimate the parameters of the photovoltaic model, and the experiment results support its superiority as well.

DE Interpretation; Visualization; Post-hoc
ID ATTENTION
AB There is an increasing demand for interpretation of model predictions especially in high-risk applications. Various visualization approaches have been proposed to estimate the part of input which is relevant to a specific model prediction. However, most approaches require model structure and parameter details in order to obtain the visualization results, and in general much effort is required to adapt each approach to multiple types of tasks particularly when model backbone and input format change over tasks. In this study, a simple yet effective visualization framework called PAMI is proposed based on the observation that deep learning models often aggregate features from local regions for model predictions. The basic idea is to mask majority of the input and use the corresponding model output as the relative contribution of the preserved input part to the original model prediction. For each input, since only a set of model outputs are collected and aggregated, PAMI does not require any model detail and can be applied to various prediction tasks with different model backbones and input formats. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks confirm the proposed method performs better than existing visualization approaches in more precisely finding class-specific input regions, and when applied to different model backbones and input formats.

AB The design of the suspension model of road cars is extremely important for both driver comfort and safety. Road traffic injuries are currently the eighth leading cause of death worldwide and are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death by 2030, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Among other factors, road infrastructure is one of the most important factors to consider when designing the suspension model, especially as autonomous driving becomes more popular. In addition, there is a growing need to test and study the impact of road roughness and pavement type on autonomous vehicles (AVs). This work provides the following contributions: a platform for suspension system optimization-flexible, highly parameterizable and rich in applications. Our solution implements, tests and optimises the 2, 3 and 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) quarter-car models (QCM) with linear seat suspension and the 5 DOF half-car model (HCM), respectively, based on random road profiles generated according to ISO 8608 standards. In addition, many multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms have been implemented and applied in isolation to see their comparative performance (in terms of Pareto fronts, hypervolume, coverage, spread, and epsilon), but most importantly we have also introduced a meta-optimization technique by super-positioning Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, where each of the algorithms, running concurrently, produces a percentage of the total number of individuals in a generation, percentage that is calculated according to the solution quality of the individuals in the previous generation. The experimental results were obtained by simulating the optimal configurations generated by the MOO heuristic algorithms on different categories of cars (small/medium). Finally, the Taguchi method and regression analysis were used to evaluate the effects of specific parameters on system responses such as sprung mass acceleration and displacement. The Taguchi simulation was performed to experimentally validate the results obtained by metaheuristic optimization methods.

ID TIME-SERIES
AB The goal of change point detection (CPD) is to identify abrupt changes in the statistics of signals or time series that reflect transitions in the underlying system's properties or states. While many statistical and learning-based approaches have been proposed to address this task, most state-of-the-art methods still treat this problem in an unsupervised setting. As a result, there is often a large gap between the algorithm-detected results and the expected outcomes of the user. To bridge this gap, we propose an active-learning strategy for the CPD problem that combines with the one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) model, resulting in an interactive CPD algorithm that improves itself by querying the end-user. This approach enables us to focus on detecting the desired change points and ignore false-positives or irrelevant change points. We demonstrate that the interactive OCSVM model can be combined with various unsupervised CPD models to function in a semi-supervised setting, resulting in improved detection accuracy. Our experimental results on various simulated and real-life datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in detection performance on both single- and multi-channel time series, even with a limited number of queries.

DE Self-supervised representation learning; Masked image modeling; Context
   autoencoder
AB We present a novel masked image modeling (MIM) approach, context autoencoder (CAE), for self-supervised representation pretraining. We pretrain an encoder by making predictions in the encoded representation space. The pretraining tasks include two tasks: masked representation prediction-predict the representations for the masked patches, and masked patch reconstruction-reconstruct the masked patches. The network is an encoder-regressor-decoder architecture: the encoder takes the visible patches as input; the regressor predicts the representations of the masked patches, which are expected to be aligned with the representations computed from the encoder, using the representations of visible patches and the positions of visible and masked patches; the decoder reconstructs the masked patches from the predicted encoded representations. The CAE design encourages the separation of learning the encoder (representation) from completing the pertaining tasks: masked representation prediction and masked patch reconstruction tasks, and making predictions in the encoded representation space empirically shows the benefit to representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CAE through superior transfer performance in downstream tasks: semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and classification. The code will be available at https://github.com/ Atten4Vis/CAE.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article
DE Information bottleneck; Robustness; Visual question answering;
   Vision-language model
ID LANGUAGE
AB Benefiting from large-scale pretrained vision language models (VLMs), the performance of visual question answering (VQA) has approached human oracles. However, finetuning such models on limited data often suffers from overfitting and poor generalization issues, leading to a lack of model robustness. In this paper, we aim to improve input robustness from an information bottleneck perspective when adapting pretrained VLMs to the downstream VQA task. Input robustness refers to the ability of models to defend against visual and linguistic input variations, as well as shortcut learning involved in inputs. Generally, the representations obtained by pretrained VLMs inevitably contain irrelevant and redundant information for a specific downstream task, resulting in statistically spurious correlations and insensitivity to input variations. To encourage representations to converge to a minimal sufficient statistic in multimodal learning, we propose Correlation Information Bottleneck (CIB), which seeks a tradeoff between compression and redundancy in representations by minimizing the mutual information (MI) between inputs and representations while maximizing the MI between outputs and representations. Moreover, we derive a tight theoretical upper bound for the mutual information between multimodal inputs and representations, incorporating different internal correlations that guide models to learn more robust representations and facilitate modality alignment. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed CIB in terms of input robustness and accuracy.

SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS

DT Article; Early Access
DE Automatic Video object segmentation; Multi-modal fusion
AB Automatic video object segmentation aims to identify a video's main object without human intervention. This task poses a challenge as it requires improving the synergy of feature fusion, which entails integrating motion and appearance cues. Although previous approaches have attempted to sample, propagate, and fuse these cues directly, they often suffer from misalignment issues. This is mainly because motion features focus on objects that are in motion, while appearance features tend to focus on more salient objects. In this paper, we design a Multi-scale Deep Feature Transfer Model (MFTM) to improve the upper limit of feature synergy through mutual mapping transformation between features. We consider the fused features as participants in feature interaction. By integrating these features, we encourage and constrain the appearance and motion features to enhance their compatibility. Additionally, we adopt pairwise combinations to facilitate the interaction propagation among motion cues, appearance cues, and fused features. This approach helps eliminate noise interference caused by different features, improving feature representations. In addition, we design a Multi-layer Feature FusionModule (MFM) to further fuse features of different scales and levels, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of the model's prediction. We test our model on two popular benchmark datasets, DAVIS2016 and FBMS. Our j-score for DAVIS2016 reached 83.1 and our j-score for FBMS reached 77.3. Besides, we achieve impressive scores on the E-MAX, F-MAX, and M metrics for the FBMS. These results provide evidence for the effectiveness of our model.

AB Numerous research has been conducted to define the molecular and clinical aspects of various tumors from a multi-omics point of view. However, there are significant obstacles in integrating multi-omics via Machine Learning (ML) for biomarker identification and cancer subtype classification. In this research, iMVAN, an integrated Multimodal Variational Autoencoder and Network fusion, is presented for biomarker discovery and classification of cancer subtypes. First, MVAE is used on multi-omics data consisting of Copy Number Variation (CNV), mRNA, and Reverse Protein Phase Array (rppa) to discover the biomarkers associated with distinct cancer subtypes. Then, multi-omics integration is accomplished by fusing similarity networks. Ultimately, the MVAE latent data and network fusion are given to a Simplified Graph Convolutional Network (SGC) for categorizing cancer subtypes. The suggested study extracts the top 100 features, which are then submitted to the KEGG analysis and survival analysis test. The survival study identifies nine biomarkers, including AGT, CDH1, CALML5, ERBB2, CCND1, FZD6, BRAF, AR, and MSH6, as poor prognostic markers. In addition, the cancer subtypes are classified, and the performance is assessed. The experimental findings demonstrate that the iMVAN performed well, with an accuracy of 87%.

ID LOCATION
AB Charging infrastructure planning (CIPL) is key to popularizing electric vehicles and reducing carbon emissions. CIPL consists of two subproblems: charging station siting and charging pile allocation. The existing methods independently solve the two subproblems and ignore their interaction, which restricts the rationality of CIPL. To address this issue, this paper proposes a dual ant colony optimization for CIPL (DACO-CIPL). In each iteration, under the guidance of heuristic information and pheromones, the upper and lower ant colonies construct solutions for charging station siting and charging pile allocation in turn, respectively. Then, a global pheromone update strategy is performed to update the pheromones of each ant colony according to the historical best solutions, which realizes information transmission from the lower ant colony to the upper ant colony. In addition, whenever the upper ant colony finishes constructing solutions, a pheromone enhancement strategy is used to strengthen the pheromones of the lower ant colony according to the solutions of the upper ant colony, which realizes information transmission from the upper ant colony to the lower ant colony. DACO-CIPL is compared with several algorithms on multiple test instances. The experimental results show that DACO-CIPL has superior performance and more reasonable options for CIPL.

ID MULTISCALE
AB Image super-resolution (SR) has been extensively investigated in recent years. However, due to the absence of trustworthy and precise perceptual quality standards, it is challenging to objectively measure the performance of different SR approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel triple attention dual-scale residual network called TADSRNet for no-reference super-resolution image quality assessment (NR-SRIQA). Firstly, we simulate the human visual system (HVS) and construct a triple attention mechanism to acquire more significant portions of SR images through cross-dimensionality, making it simpler to identify visually sensitive regions. Then a dual-scale convolution module (DSCM) is constructed to capture quality-perceived features at different scales. Furthermore, in order to collect more informative feature representation, a residual connection is added to the network to compensate for perceptual features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TADSRNet can predict visual quality with greater accuracy and better consistency with human perception compared with existing IQA methods. The code will be available at https://github.com/kbzhang0505/TADSRNet.

   Convolutional neural network; Supervised learning; Data preprocessing
AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly contributed to recent advances in machine learning and computer vision. Although initially designed for image classification, the application of CNNs has stretched far beyond the context of images alone. Some exciting applications, e.g., in natural language processing and image segmentation, implement one-dimensional CNNs, often after a pre-processing step that transforms higher-dimensional input into a suitable data format for the networks. However, local correlations within data can diminish or vanish when one converts higher-dimensional data into a one-dimensional string. The Hilbert space-filling curve can minimize this loss of locality. Here, we study this claim rigorously by comparing an analytical model that quantifies locality preservation with the performance of several neural networks trained with and without Hilbert mappings. We find that Hilbert mappings offer a consistent advantage over the traditional flatten transformation in test accuracy and training speed. The results also depend on the chosen kernel size, agreeing with our analytical model. Our findings quantify the importance of locality preservation when transforming data before training a one-dimensional CNN and show that the Hilbert space-filling curve is a preferential transformation to achieve this goal.

AB Person-following is a crucial capability for service robots, and the employment of vision technology is a leading trend in building environmental understanding. While most existing methodologies rely on a tracking-by-detection strategy, which necessitates extensive datasets for training and yet remains susceptible to environmental noise, we propose a novel approach: real-time tracking-by-segmentation with a future motion estimation framework. This framework facilitates pixel-level tracking of a target individual and predicts their future motion. Our strategy leverages a single-shot segmentation tracking neural network for precise foreground segmentation to track the target, overcoming the limitations of using a rectangular region of interest (ROI). Here we clarify that, while the ROI provides a broad context, the segmentation within this bounding box offers a detailed and more accurate position of the human subject. To further improve our approach, a classification-lock pre-trained layer is utilized to form a constraint that curbs feature outliers originating from the person being tracked. A discriminative correlation filter estimates the potential target region in the scene to prevent foreground misrecognition, while a motion estimation neural network anticipates the target's future motion for use in the control module. We validated our proposed methodology using the VOT, LaSot, YouTube-VOS, and Davis tracking datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Notably, our framework supports long-term person-following tasks in indoor environments, showing promise for practical implementation in service robots.

AB Detecting conditional independencies plays a key role in several statistical and machine learning tasks, especially in causal discovery algorithms, yet it remains a highly challenging problem due to dimensionality and complex relationships presented in data. In this study, we introduce LCIT (Latent representation-based Conditional Independence Test)-a novel method for conditional independence testing based on representation learning. Our main contribution involves a hypothesis testing framework in which to test for the independence between X and Y given Z, we first learn to infer the latent representations of target variables X and Y that contain no information about the conditioning variable Z. The latent variables are then investigated for any significant remaining dependencies, which can be performed using a conventional correlation test. Moreover, LCIT can also handle discrete and mixed-type data in general by converting discrete variables into the continuous domain via variational dequantization. The empirical evaluations show that LCIT outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines consistently under different evaluation metrics, and is able to adapt really well to both nonlinear, high-dimensional, and mixed data settings on a diverse collection of synthetic and real data sets.

ID SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION
AB As AI technologies are rolled out into healthcare, academia, human resources, law, and a multitude of other domains, they become de-facto arbiters of truth. But truth is highly contested, with many different definitions and approaches. This article discusses the struggle for truth in AI systems and the general responses to date. It then investigates the production of truth in InstructGPT, a large language model, highlighting how data harvesting, model architectures, and social feedback mechanisms weave together disparate understandings of veracity. It conceptualizes this performance as an operationalization of truth, where distinct, often-conflicting claims are smoothly synthesized and confidently presented into truth-statements. We argue that these same logics and inconsistencies play out in Instruct's successor, ChatGPT, reiterating truth as a non-trivial problem. We suggest that enriching sociality and thickening "reality" are two promising vectors for enhancing the truth-evaluating capacities of future language models. We conclude, however, by stepping back to consider AI truth-telling as a social practice: what kind of "truth" do we as listeners desire?

AB It remains challenging in characterizing uncertain and imprecise information when clustering fuzzy number data. To solve such a problem, this paper investigates a new credal-based fuzzy number data clustering (CFNDC) method based on the theory of belief functions (TBF). The CFNDC method attempts to learn a general and flexible credal partition to gain deeper insights into fuzzy number data. Specifically, the CFNDC can provide the behavior (support degrees) for each fuzzy number in different clusters to characterize uncertainty. Additionally, it can reasonably assign the fuzzy numbers in overlapping regions to related meta-clusters, defined as the disjunction of several close specific clusters, to characterize imprecision. Doing so allows prudent decision-making and reduces the risk of errors. We evaluate the performance of different methods using various evaluation indexes and introduce a new measure called evidential purity (EPU). The proposed CFNDC method achieves an average EPU of 0.8330, which demonstrates that CFNDC is a promising tool for effectively handling fuzzy number data.

AB this article, we propose RRT-Q(8)(X), an online and intermittent kinodynamic motion planning framework for dynamic environments with unknown robot dynamics and unknown disturbances. We leverage RRTX for global path plan-ning and rapid replanning to produce waypoints as a sequence of boundary-value problems (BVPs). For each BVP, we formulate a finite-horizon, continuous-time zero-sum game, where the control input is the minimizer, and the worst case disturbance is the maximizer. We propose a robust intermittent Q-learning controller for waypoint navigation with completely unknown system dynamics, external disturbances, and intermittent control updates. We execute a relaxed persistence of excitation technique to guarantee that the Q-learning controller converges to the optimal controller. We provide rigorous Lyapunov-based proofs to guarantee the closed-loop stability of the equilibrium point. The effectiveness of the proposed RRT-Q(8)(X) is illustrated with Monte Carlo numerical experiments in numerous dynamic and changing environments.

AB Biological sequence classification is an essential task in many fields, such as machine learning, biology, and bioinformatics. Due to the spread of the coronavirus disease, numerous sequence data are available to researchers. As this virus has affected many hosts (e.g. bats, humans, chickens, etc.) and transformed into different lineages/variants (e.g., alpha, beta, gamma, and omicron, etc.), the biological sequence data for this virus is accompanied by the respective information about the affected host and lineage type of the sequences. Moreover, it is well known in the biology domain that many mutations (that happen disproportionally) related to the coronavirus are present in the spike protein region. Therefore, working with only spike sequences is usually sufficient rather than using a full-length genome for sequence analysis. For a spike sequence, this paper intends to design an image representation so that sophisticated image classification algorithms can be applied to perform the tasks of coronavirus lineages and host classifications. We propose a method based on the idea of chaos game representation (CGR), called Spike2CGR, which converts spike sequences into graphical form (images), and those images are used as input to deep learning (DL) models. We also use some domain knowledge from the biology field to design a few modified versions of Spike2CGR that are biologically meaningful and outperform the SOTA in terms of predictive performance. We use different DL models to perform coronavirus lineage and host classifications and report predictive results employing various evaluation metrics. Using two real-world datasets, we show that Spike2CGR outperforms the SOTA method in terms of predictive performance on spike sequences for variant and host classification.

AB Supervised deep learning requires a huge amount of reference data, which is often difficult and expensive to obtain. Domain adaptation helps with this problem-labelled data from one dataset should help in learning on another unlabelled or scarcely labelled dataset. In remote sensing, where a variety of sensors produce images of different modalities and with different numbers of channels, it would be very beneficial to develop heterogeneous domain adaptation methods that are able to work between domains that come from different input spaces. However, this challenging problem is rarely addressed, the majority of existing heterogeneous domain adaptation work does not use raw image-data, or they rely on translation from one domain to the other, therefore ignoring domain-invariant feature extraction approaches. This article proposes novel approaches for heterogeneous image domain adaptation for both the semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. These are based on extracting domain invariant features using deep adversarial learning. For the unsupervised domain adaptation case, the impact of pseudo-labelling is also investigated. We evaluate on two heterogeneous remote sensing datasets, one being RGB, and the other multispectral, for the task of land-cover patch classification, and also on a standard computer vision benchmark of RGB-depth map object classification. The results show that the proposed domain invariant approach consistently outperforms the competing methods based on image-to-image/feature translation, in both remote sensing and in a standard computer vision problem.

AB Cybersecurity guarantees the exchange of information through a public channel in a secure way. That is the data must be protected from unauthorized parties and transmitted to the intended parties with confidentiality and integrity. In this work, we mount an attack on a cryptosystem based on multivariate polynomial trapdoor function over the field of rational numbers Q. The developers claim that the security of their proposed scheme depends on the fact that a polynomial system consisting of 2n (where n is a natural number) equations and 3n unknowns constructed by using quasigroup string transformations, has infinitely many solutions and finding exact solution is not possible. We explain that the proposed trapdoor function is vulnerable to a Grobner basis attack. Selected polynomials in the corresponding Grobner basis can be used to recover the plaintext against a given ciphertext without the knowledge of the secret key.

AB Multi-agent systems are promising for applications in various fields. However, they require optimization algorithms that can handle large number of agents and heterogeneously connected networks in clustered environments. Planning algorithms performed in the decentralized communication model and clustered environment require precise knowledge about cluster information by compensating noise from other clusters. This article proposes a decentralized data aggregation algorithm using consensus method to perform COUNT and SUM aggregation in a clustered environment. The proposed algorithm introduces a trust value to perform accurate aggregation on cluster level. The correction parameter is used to adjust the accuracy of the solution and the computation time. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in simulations with large and sparse networks and small bandwidth. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve convergence on the aggregated data with reasonable accuracy and convergence time. In the future, the proposed tools will be useful for developing a robust decentralized task assignment algorithm in a heterogeneous multi-agent multi-task environment.

ID SYSTEMS
AB The past decade has seen substantial growth in online transactions. Accordingly, many professionals and researchers utilize deep learning models to design and develop recommender systems to suit the needs of online personal services. These systems can model the interactions between users and items. However, existing approaches focus on either modeling global or local item correlation and rarely consider both cases, thus failing to represent user-item correlation very well. Therefore, this article proposes a deep collaborative recommendation system based on a convolutional neural network with an outer product matrix and a hybrid feature selection module to capture local and global higher-order interaction between users and items. Moreover, we incorporated the weights of generalized matrix factorization to optimize the overall network performance and prevent overfitting. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on two real-world datasets with different sparsity to confirm that our proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods we have used in the experiment.

AB Forecasting stock market indices is challenging because stock prices are usually nonlinear and non-stationary. COVID-19 has had a significant impact on stock market volatility, which makes forecasting more challenging. Since the number of confirmed cases significantly impacted the stock price index; hence, it has been considered a covariate in this analysis. The primary focus of this study is to address the challenge of forecasting volatile stock indices during Covid-19 by employing time series analysis. In particular, the goal is to find the best method to predict future stock price indices in relation to the number of COVID-19 infection rates. In this study, the effect of covariates has been analyzed for three stock indices: S & P 500, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) world stock index, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX). Results show that parametric approaches can be good forecasting models for the S & P 500 index and the VIX index. On the other hand, a random walk model can be adopted to forecast the MSCI index. Moreover, among the three random walk forecasting methods for the MSCI index, the naive method provides the best forecasting model.

AB In recent years, as corporate consciousness of environmental preservation and sustainable growth has increased, the importance of sustainability marketing in the logistic process has grown. Both academics and business have increased their focus on sustainable logistics procedures. As the body of literature expands, expanding the field's knowledge requires establishing new avenues by analyzing past research critically and identifying future prospects. The concept of "q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft set" (q-ROFSS) is a new hybrid model of a q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS) and soft set (SS). A q-ROFSS is a novel approach to address uncertain information in terms of generalized membership grades in a broader space. The basic alluring characteristic of q-ROFS is that they provide a broader space for membership and non-membership grades whereas SS is a robust approach to address uncertain information. These models play a vital role in various fields such as decision analysis, information analysis, computational intelligence, and artificial intelligence. The main objective of this article is to construct new aggregation operators (AOs) named "q rung orthopair fuzzy soft prioritized weighted averaging" (q-ROFSPWA) operator and "q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft prioritized weighted geometric" (q-ROFSPWG) operator for the fusion of a group of q-rung orthopair fuzzy soft numbers and to tackle complexities and difficulties in existing operators. These AOs provide more effective information fusion tools for uncertain multi-attribute decision-making problems. Additionally, it was shown that the proposed AOs have a higher power of discriminating and are less sensitive to noise when it comes to evaluating the performances of sustainable logistic providers.

AB A fuel cell, an energy conversion system, needs analysis for its performance at the design and off-design point conditions during its real-time operation. System performance evaluation with logical methodology is helpful in decision-making while considering efficiency and cross-correlated parameters in fuel cells. This work presents an overview and categorization of different fuel cells, leading to the developing of a method combining graph theory and matrix method for analyzing fuel cell system structure to make more informed decisions. The fuel cell system is divided into four interdependent sub-systems. The methodology developed in this work consists of a series of steps comprised of digraph representation, matrix representation, and permanent function representation. A mathematical model is evaluated quantitatively to produce a performance index numerical value. With the aid of case studies, the proposed methodology is explained, and the advantages of the proposed method are corroborated.

DE Interval Markov chains; Model checking; Probabilistic systems
ID MODEL-CHECKING; COMPLEXITY
AB Interval Markov chains extend classical Markov chains with the possibility to describe transition probabilities using intervals, rather than exact values. While the standard formulation of interval Markov chains features closed intervals, previous work has considered open interval Markov chains, in which the intervals can also be open or half-open. In this article we focus on qualitative reachability problems for open interval Markov chains, which consider whether the optimal (maximum or minimum) probability with which a certain set of states can be reached is equal to 0 or 1. We present polynomial-time algorithms for these problems for both of the standard semantics of interval Markov chains. Our methods do not rely on the closure of open intervals, in contrast to previous approaches for open interval Markov chains, and can address situations in which probability 0 or 1 can be attained not exactly but arbitrarily closely.

AB The traditional approach to e-commerce marketing encounters challenges in effectively extracting and utilizing user data, as well as analyzing and targeting specific user segments. This manuscript aims to address these limitations by proposing the establishment of a consumer behavior analysis system based on an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. The system harnesses the potential of radio frequency identification devices (RFID) technology for product identification encoding, thus facilitating the monitoring of product sales processes. To categorize consumers, the system incorporates a k-means algorithm within its architectural framework. Furthermore, a similarity metric is employed to evaluate the gathered consumption information and refine the selection strategy for initial clustering centers. The proposed methodology is subjected to rigorous testing, revealing its effectiveness in resolving the issue of insufficient differentiation between customer categories after clustering. Across varying values of k, the average false recognition rate experiences a notable reduction of 20.6%. The system consistently demonstrates rapid throughput and minimal overall latency, boasting an impressive processing time of merely 2 ms, thereby signifying its exceptional concurrent processing capability. Through the implementation of the proposed system, the opportunity for further target market segmentation arises, enabling the establishment of core market positioning and the formulation of distinct and precise marketing strategies tailored to diverse consumer cohorts. This pioneering approach introduces an innovative and efficient methodology that e-commerce enterprises can embrace to amplify their marketing endeavors.

AB Yoga is a healthy practice aimed at improving a person's physical, mental and spiritual well-being. Computational research is a great opportunity in all human societies due to the latest technological developments. However, applying artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to a medium-sized topic like yoga is difficult. This study offers a method for accurately classifying different yoga asanas using deep learning approaches. Deep learning techniques were used in this study to build a system that can recognize yoga positions from a video or an image. Real-time videos are used to extract functions from the key points of every frame, derived from the pose estimation algorithm, and long short-term memory is applied to provide tentative predictions. A data set comprising ten yoga asanas created with a standard webcam, which is publicly available, were considered. The end-to-end deep-learning pipeline was used in this work to discover yoga from videos. In a single frame, it achieves 98 percent test accuracy, and after sampling data, it achieves 99.5 percent accuracy in 55 frames of video. When the method is applied to temporal data, it gathers knowledge from earlier frames to produce a correct and accurate result. The method was tested in real time for various groups of ten people (five men and five women) and was found to be 99.02 percent accurate. The results of the experiments provide a quality assessment of the process and a state-of-the-art comparison.

AB A digital plane is a digitization of a Euclidean plane. A plane is specified by its normal, which is a 3D vector with integer coordinates, as considered in this case. It is established here that a 3D digital straight line segment, shifted by an integer amount, can produce the digitized plane. 3D plane's normals are classified based on the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of its components, and the net code is calculated separately for each case. Experimental results are provided for several normals. Also, we show that the digital plane segment generated is a connected digital plane. The proposed method mainly involves integer arithmetic.

ID FACTORIZATION
AB Incomplete multiview clustering (IMVC) has received increasing attention since it is often that some views of samples are incomplete in reality. Most existing methods learn similarity subgraphs from original incomplete multiview data and seek complete graphs by exploring the incomplete subgraphs of each view for spectral clustering. However, the graphs constructed on the original high-dimensional data may be suboptimal due to feature redundancy and noise. Besides, previous methods generally ignored the graph noise caused by the interclass and intraclass structure variation during the transformation of incomplete graphs and complete graphs. To address these problems, we propose a novel joint projection learning and tensor decomposition (JPLTD)-based method for IMVC. Specifically, to alleviate the influence of redundant features and noise in high-dimensional data, JPLTD introduces an orthogonal projection matrix to project the high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space for compact feature learning. Meanwhile, based on the lower-dimensional space, the similarity graphs corresponding to instances of different views are learned, and JPLTD stacks these graphs into a third-order low-rank tensor to explore the high-order correlations across different views. We further consider the graph noise of projected data caused by missing samples and use a tensor-decomposition-based graph filter for robust clustering. JPLTD decomposes the original tensor into an intrinsic tensor and a sparse tensor. The intrinsic tensor models the true data similarities. An effective optimization algorithm is adopted to solve the JPLTD model. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that JPLTD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code of JPLTD is available at https://github.com/weilvNJU/JPLTD.

TI Learning to estimate optical flow using dual-frequency paradigm

DT Article; Early Access
DE Optical flow estimation; Dual-frequency; Lifting wavelet scheme
AB Deep learning-based optical flow estimation achieved impressive success with faster inference time and outperformed performance. Optical flow estimation networks are usually treated as a black box relying on large amounts of synthetic data for training, therefore the generalization and robustness of the network applying in realities remains a challenge. To overcome these problems, a dual-frequency paradigm is proposed for optical flow estimation. The proposed dual-frequency encoder captures discriminative features with both high-frequency and low-frequency biases. It is experimentally demonstrated that our method achieves better generalization while only pre-trained on FlyingChiars. Furthermore, our method improves the prediction of optical flow in occluded regions by enhancing the perception of high-frequency features that further improve the robustness of the network. Compared to the start-of-the-art RAFT, our approach obtains an improvement of the average end-point error by 10.6% on the Sintel Clean datasets and 11.7% on the challenging Sintel Final dataset.

AB This article presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) workflow to enhance drilling performance by mitigating the adverse impact of drill-string vibrations on drilling efficiency. The study employs three supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Regression Decision Tree (DTR), to train models for bit rotation (Bit RPM), rate of penetration (ROP), and torque. These models combine to form a digital twin for a drilling system and are validated through extensive cross-validation procedures against actual drilling parameters using field data.
   The combined SVR - Bit RPM model is then used to categorize torsional vibrations and constrain optimized parameter selection using the Particle Swarm Optimization block (PSO). The SVR-ROP model is integrated with a PSO under two constraints: Stick Slip Index (SSI<0.05) and Depth of Cut (DOC<5 mm) to further improve torsional stability. Simulations predict a 43% increase in ROP and torsional stability on average when the optimized parameters WOB and RPM are applied. This would avoid the need to trip in/out to change the bit, and the drilling time can be reduced from 66 to 31 h.
   The findings of this study illustrate the system's competency in determining optimal drilling parameters and boosting drilling efficiency. Integrating AI techniques offers valuable insights and practical solutions for drilling optimization, particularly in terms of saving drilling time and improving the ROP, which increases potential savings.

AB Accurate prediction of coal consumption is crucial to the structural adjustment and high-quality development of the coal industry, and provides an effective basis for the government to formulate energy strategies. To enhance the prediction accuracy, a hybrid prediction model combining grey wolf optimization algorithm and grey Markov model (GWO_Markov_DNGM) is proposed in this study, which introduces the idea of Markov interval division in order to make up the defect of obtaining interval by experience in the past. In this research, coal consumption in Hebei Province from 2001 to 2020 is used as an example to verify the accuracy of the model and the results show that the proposed model has higher accuracy than the comparison models, including ARIMA, GM (1, 1), DGM (1, 1), DNGM (1, 1) and the grey Markov model with equidistant division of state interval. In addition, this study also discusses the influence of numbers of state intervals on the prediction accuracy of the proposed model, which further illustrates the high prediction accuracy of the proposed hybrid model. Finally, the proposed model is employed to predict the coal consumption of Hebei Province under three scenarios from 2021 to 2025, and several suggestions are put forward.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB The triangle counting problem in graph streams has been extensively studied in social network analysis, recommendation systems, user portraits and other fields. However, cloud computing based streaming algorithms cause high bandwidth occupation and long transmission latency due to limited bandwidth of the cloud. Recently, edge computing is promising to overcome the issue of transmitting large-scale data for cloud computing. However, directly applying edge computing in streaming triangle counting will reduce the accuracy of the triangle count estimation, due to the limitation of local computing at the edge network. We term the cooperations between edge computing and cloud computing for streaming triangle counting as edge-cloud triangle counting in graph streams. In this paper, we first propose a streaming framework for edge-cloud triangle counting in graph streams. Then, we propose a streaming triangle counting algorithm called Trie-based Edge Compression (TbEC) by using the binary trie at the edge network that enables lossless compression and efficient transmission to the cloud. In addition, to extend our algorithms for triangle counting in multigraphs, we present a dual deduplication strategy collaboratively using the trie-based data structure and a Bloom Filter. Our experiments with real-world datasets show that TbEC is (a) Accurate: yielding up to 3.35x more accurate smaller estimation error than the state-of-the-art distributed streaming algorithm, (b) Fast: yielding up to 10.59x faster than the state-of-the-art distributed streaming algorithm, (c) Scalable: scaling linearly with the number of edges in the input graph stream.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lane-changing control is a crucial task to regulate the traffic flow in the intelligent transportation system efficiently, and manipulating the lane-changing maneuvers for many vehicles optimally and simultaneously in a congested traffic environment is a challenge. This study formulates a lane-changing model where the traffic lanes are discretized into cells, considers both mandatory lane-changing and discretionary lane-changing maneuvers and proposes a novel approach based on a deep Q-network with a request-respond mechanism. The modeled lane-changing system is divided into isolated and symmetry groups, then independent Q-learning and the concept "central agent'' are integrated to simplify the training process. In the proposed approach, these groups can be classified into two categories: request group and respond group. The request group and respond group are trained separately during the training process. Specifically, the request group trains agents with only considering the states of the group, while the respond group also evaluates the superimposing actions (i.e., the request message) from the request group besides the states of the group. The execution process is also treated the same decentralized way as the training process. Then, the baselines such as a rule-based method, a game theory-based decomposition algorithm and a simple deep Q-learning method are compared with the proposed approach. Results reveal that the proposed approach performs as well as the game theory-based decomposition algorithm and outperforms the other two in terms of lane-changing efficiency. However, the computational time of the proposed approach in the execution process is far less than the game theory-based decomposition algorithm, especially in a congested traffic environment.

DE Knowledge graph competition prediction; Deep representation learning;
   Frequency inception
AB Recently, knowledge graphs have been broadly studied using approaches such as translation-based models and convolutional neural networks. Although such approaches can express powerful and rich embeddings, graphs are naturally suitable for irregular data. Thus, they can model knowledge graphs with structured data and aggregate considerable information. However, graphs are subject to incompleteness, leading to unconnected knowledge graphs. To address this problem, we propose a framework called frequency-inception-based graph neural network (FiGNN) for relation prediction in knowledge graphs. It exploits a graph to aggregate the most beneficial information through mathematical analysis. Specifically, combined with the relations and inception parameters, each channel of a node and its neighbours dynamically contribute to next-layer channel information, which can extract underlying signals of different channels and neighbouring nodes. Moreover, the representation ability of the nodes is enhanced and over-smoothing is alleviated. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed network on various benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network achieves substantial improvements and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI EASC: An exception-aware semantic compression framework for real-world
   knowledge graphs
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
LA English

ID RDF; DBPEDIA
AB Knowledge graphs (KGs) have achieved great success in many real applications, and great efforts have been dedicated to constructing larger knowledge graphs. An obvious trend in KG construction is that the KGs become ever-increasingly bigger. However, we argue that constructing a KG by directly inserting more triples may harm the performance of the KG, and one possible solution is KG compression. In this paper, we propose an exception-aware semantic lossless compression framework EASC to compress a KG. Since many triples can be inferred from other triples with semantic rules, we remove the triples that can be inferred and store the rules and exception cases. Specifically, we formalize the lossless compression problem as a weighted set cover problem, which is NP-hard, and propose a semantic lossless compression algorithm to get an approximation result. We conduct extensive experiments on seven real-world large-scale KGs. The results show that EASC achieves stateof-the-art performance in semantic compression methods. Furthermore, by combining EASC as an independent module with syntactic compression methods, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in lossless compression methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Monitoring and tracking the size and the number of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is very important in clinical medicine to understand the course and estimate the progression of this demyelination disease. The lesions could be identified by the experts with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, especially the fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR), which generates two-dimensional slices sampled from the three-dimensional space with specified slice thickness and increment values. Not every MRI scan, however, could be contiguous nor overlapping due to many reasons, to prevent from a drastic increase in the overall duration of the scans. Particularly, it is very hard to stabilize a child for hours in the same position; therefore, the specialists keep the scan procedure as short as possible, by increasing the slice thickness and more importantly, reducing the number of slices which cause some consistent gaps emerging between the slices and leading to inconclusive results. Given these facts, we propose a novel procedure to overcome this inadequacy by filling the gaps of incremental MRIs based on a Nakagami imaging and a content-based morphing method generating imaginary frames between the genuine MRI slices. Afterwards, the segmented images are reconstructed in three-dimensional space to estimate the lesion volumes for three consecutive scans of one patient. The results are greatly encouraging that we calculated 95.72% as the mean average percentage accuracy (MAPA) with 92.17% dice score (DSC%); while a little sacrifice in DSC% down to 90.35% provided us a better MAPA of 96.44%; while without morphing, the MAPA was calculated using only the binary ground truth (GT) images as 85.97%. As an expert system, the automated framework we presented would be very beneficial for volume estimations in clinics as well as visualizing the lesions and tracking the progression of MS disease.

AB This paper proposes a new model, called rotor finite element mimetic neural network (RFEMNN), for diagnosing rotor unbalance and shaft crack faults. RFEMNN uses a convolution long short-term memory networks (CNN-LSTM) architecture to achieve fault recognition and localization in the rotor structure. The term "Mimetic"refers to the topology of the rotor finite element model and solution process by custom designing NN structure and data flow, which is based on the physics informed structure paradigm. The proposed "Mimetic"theory enhances the physics consistency of the RFEMNN model without requiring complete analytic physical knowledge or all parameter values. The proposed model's effectiveness is validated through experimental tests, compared to 9 benchmark models from the literature and one deep learning model with the same depth but no physics embedding. Results showed that RFEMNN outperformed the benchmark models with a comprehensive diagnostics accuracy of 94.7%, indicating its potential for practical industrial applications.

DE Multi-view representation learning; Contrastive learning; Semantic

AB In this work, we devote ourselves to the challenging task of Unsupervised Multi-view Representation Learning (UMRL), which requires learning a unified feature representation from multiple views in an unsupervised manner. Existing UMRL methods mainly focus on the learning process within the feature space while ignoring the valuable semantic information hidden in different views. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Semantically Consistent Multi-view Representation Learning (SCMRL), which aims to excavate underlying multi-view semantic consensus information and utilize it to guide the unified feature representation learning process. Specifically, SCMRL consists of a within view reconstruction module and a unified feature representation learning module. These modules are elegantly integrated using a contrastive learning strategy, which serves to align the semantic labels of both view-specific feature representations and the learned unified feature representation simultaneously. This integration allows SCMRL to effectively leverage consensus information in the semantic space, thereby constraining the learning process of the unified feature representation. Compared with several state-of-the-art algorithms, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority. Our code is released on https://github.com/YiyangZhou/SCMRL.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

And the model investigated in this paper is constructed on strongly connected digraphs (SCD) and digraphs without strong connectedness, respectively. Besides, stabilization criteria for SMCSTD based on SCD are obtained by the graph theory and the Lyapunov method. In addition, for SMCSTD based on digraphs without strong connectedness, stabilization criteria are proposed by means of the Lyapunov method, the graph theory and the theory of asymptotically autonomous systems.

AB We propose a new deep learning cascade prediction model CasSIM that can simultaneously achieve two most demanded objectives: popularity prediction and final adopter prediction. Compared to existing methods based on cascade representation, CasSIM simulates information diffusion processes by exploring users' dual roles in information propagation with three basic factors: users' susceptibilities, influences and message contents. With effective user profiling, we are the first to capture the topic-specific property of susceptibilities and influences. In addition, the use of graph neural networks allows CasSIM to capture the dynamics of susceptibilities and influences during information diffusion. We evaluate the effectiveness of CasSIM on three real-life datasets and the results show that CasSIM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in popularity and final adopter prediction.

ID SELECTION
AB In this paper we present a correlation based safe screening technique for building the complete Lasso path. Unlike many other Lasso screening approaches we do not consider prespecified values of the regularization parameter, but, instead, prune variables which cannot be the next best feature to be added to the model. Based on those results we present a modified homotopy algorithm for computing the regularization path. We demonstrate that, even though our algorithm provides the complete Lasso path, its performance is competitive with state of the art algorithms which, however, only provide solutions at a prespecified sample of regularization parameters. We also address problems of extremely high dimensionality, where the variables may not fit into main memory and are assumed to be stored on disk. A multidimensional index is used to quickly retrieve potentially relevant variables. We apply the approach to the important case when multiple models are built against a fixed set of variables, frequently encountered in statistical databases. We perform experiments using the complete Eurostat database as predictors and demonstrate that our approach allows for practical and efficient construction of Lasso models, which remain accurate and interpretable even when millions of highly correlated predictors are present.

   comparative study of discretization and clustering approaches on
   sensor-based datasets
SO KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Hybrid classifier; Machine learning; Discretization; Clustering
AB Accuracy in a classification problem is directly related to the ability of features to adequately represent the differences between classes. In sensor-based datasets, measurements taken from the sensor form feature vectors. Measuring a given physical signal with different sensors enables it to be expressed with various feature vectors. For this reason, using sensor fusion is preferred in data acquisition. However, each new sensor added to the system brings problems such as complex sensory and supply circuit structures, extra energy consumption, signal sampling complexity, and time-consumption. On the other hand, in cases where sensor fusion cannot be applied, the ability of data from one sensor to represent classes may be insufficient. To avoid these problems, discretization and clustering approaches are suitable to derive more features from fewer sensors. The aim is to improve the accuracy of classifiers by deriving new feature vectors that can represent sensor data. This research reveals the contributions of clustering and discretization approaches as feature extraction methods to improve classification accuracy. In this study, three widely used machine learning techniques are investigated on Perfume, Wine, Seeds, and Gas datasets from the UCI repository. This comprehensive empirical study indicates that the accuracy of classifiers improves by up to 20% on datasets obtained from some sensors by using both discretization and clustering as feature-extracting methods.

AB The digital healthcare paradigm has significantly improved based on distributed fog and cloud networks for cancer detection with multiple classes in recent years. The paradigm allows the collecting and training of cancer data on various computing nodes to make optimal cancer detection with their classes. In paradigm, multiomics approaches (such as RNA, miRNA, and methylation) and machine learning techniques have achieved remarkable results in predicting cancer with different features. However, the digital healthcare paradigm for cancer detection concerning infrastructure still faces challenges related to security, execution delay, and improving the accuracy of cancer prediction in existing studies. These limitations affect the overall cancer detection results with more accuracy. In this paper, we are handling the research mentioned above limitations. We present a new paradigm for cancer detection with more accuracy, less processing delay, and more security based on fog cloud heterogeneous computing nodes. We present the Multi-Cancer Multi-Omics Clinical Dataset Laboratories (MCMOCL) Schemes to predict multi-cancers with multiple classes and consist of federated learning, auto-encoder, and XGBoost methods. The main objective of this study is to improve accuracy, reduce execution delay, and improve the security among heterogeneous cancer clinics in the architecture. Simulation results show that MCMOCL outperformed all existing machine models in terms of accuracy by 98% , processing delay by 61%, and security for the multi-classes types of cancers in heterogeneous fog cloud paradigm.

DE Digital twin; Transferable digital twin (TDT); Multi-dimensional

AB High-fidelity digital twin models include not only concrete geometric models but also intrinsic models such as mechanism models and data models, which require high information dimensionality. Consequently, modeling, validation, and implementation cycles become challenging and time-consuming. The reuse of existing digital twin models to achieve rapid transference and utilization of models is becoming one of the hot topics in digital twin modeling. To this effect, aiming at how to reuse the multi-dimensional information of existing models to improve modeling efficiency and resilience, this paper proposes a rapid transferable modeling approach for digital twin models. The approach proposes a unified mapping and digital representation of physical entities based on information metamodels, which can rapidly instantiate digital twin assets. Then, the transferable approaches from the geometry dimension, behavior dimension, and algorithm dimension are given respectively, which include the information model reuse, action feature query and rule generation, as well as fine-tuning of data-driven mechanisms and domain adaptive of digital twins. Finally, through a practical case study, the result shows that the efficiency of modeling improves by 60.39%, and the effectiveness of the model after domain adaptation improves by 6.94%.

AB The big challenge of free-floating bike sharing system is to rebalance the supply and demand in different places. Most studies are static rebalancing that moves bikes at night. Dynamic rebalancing considers the scheduling of transport vehicles during the day. It is more effective and difficult to solve. In this paper, a multiobjective dynamic rebalancing problem is solved. The two optimization objectives are considered: minimizing the total distance of rebalancing vehicle and minimizing the total demand unmet. A mathematic model is built to formulate the problem. A new algorithm SFMEA-AP (Sequence Flow Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm with Area Protected) that uses the sequence flow encoding is proposed. An novel area protected strategy that includes a non dominated sorting with similarity comparison is proposed. It simultaneously considers the fairness and competitiveness in solution space. Six neighborhood search operators are designed. They are used as variable neighborhood search strategy. Computational experiments show that SFMEA-AP can obtain better solution quality than SFMEA-VNS, QMOEA, NSGA-II, ILS and LSMOVRPTW. The IGD values of non-dominated solutions of SFMEA-AP are better than those of SFMEA-VNS, QMOEA, NSGA-II, ILS and LSMOVRPTW. In addition, the non-dominated solution set of SFMEA-AP have good diversity.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The fields of energy storage, photocatalysis, and sensors have undergone substantial technological advancements, which have led to the generation of vast amounts of data on electrochemical impedance (EIS). The interpretation of large amounts of EIS data is a challenging task since the analysis of EIS data requires multiple steps to get a suitable equivalent circuit. Recently, some progress has been made in the machine learning (ML) model for EIS classification. However, most of the ML models are performed as a "black box" model, which provides only the classification result and lacks physical descriptor representation. Here, we apply variational autoencoders (VAE) to EIS data analysis, which includes classification, parameter prediction, and the visualization of physical descriptors. The VAE model performed well in the classification task, with an accuracy of 82.0%-92.4%. In the prediction task, VAE shows a high R-squared value on the Randles circuit. Additionally, the VAE model can map physical descriptors to the latent space, allowing the latent space to transform into a property space, which plays an important role in the optimization and exploration of novel materials research.

AB Improper fuel loading decision results in carrying excessive dead weight during flight operation, which will burden the airline operation cost and cause extra waste emission. Existing works mainly focused on the postevent fuel consumption based on flight trajectory. In this work, a novel deep learning model, called FCPNet, is proposed to achieve the fuel consumption prediction (FCP) before the flight departure. Considering the influential factors for aircraft performance, the multi-modal information sources, including the planned route, weather information, and operation details, are selected as the model input to predict fuel consumption. Correspondingly, three modules are innovatively proposed to learn embedding features from multi-modal inputs. Based on the planned route, the graph convolutional network is proposed to mine the spatial correlations in the non-Eulerian route network. Considering the grid attributes of the weather information, the ConvLSTM is applied to learn abstract representations from both the temporal and spatial dimensions, in which the three-dimensional convolution neural networks are also designed to fine-tune intermediate feature maps. The fully connected layer is also proposed to learn informative features from operation details. Finally, an attention-based fusion network is presented to generate the final embedding by considering the unique contributions of the multi-modality sources, which are further applied to predict flight fuel consumption. A binary encoding representation is proposed to formulate the FCP task as a multi-binary classification problem. The proposed model is validated on a real-world dataset, and the results demonstrate that it outperforms other baselines, i.e., achieving a 6.50% mean absolute percentage error, which can practically support the airline operation and global emission control before flight departure.

ID SUPPLY CHAIN; INFORMATION; MARKETS
AB With data being generated at an unprecedented rate, monetizing data has become a paramount issue in this era of the digital economy. Firms have traditionally leveraged consumer data to improve their product or service offerings and increase their sales revenue, which is indirect data monetization. The recent emergence of online data markets and the data brokerage industry have facilitated direct data monetization, enabling firms to obtain additional revenue by selling their anonymized data directly to data brokers. This study develops a gametheoretic model to investigate the impact of direct data monetization on competition between firms. Our results show that in equilibrium, high-value firms with competitive advantages in product or service value often sell less data than low-value firms, implying that high-value firms rely less on direct data monetization than lowvalue firms. Surprisingly, as direct data monetization prevails, high-value firms further dominate the market for selling products or services, especially when the data broker's analytics capability is high. This result reveals that data brokers with high analytics capabilities can hinder, rather than facilitate, market competition. Finally, direct data monetization may benefit both consumer surplus and social welfare because it facilitates data-sharing between firms, allowing firms to obtain additional insights to improve their product or service offerings. These findings are explored in-depth, along with different model extensions and their relevant managerial implications.

ID CORRELATION ALIGNMENT
AB In the field of Machine Learning, it is widely acknowledged that training and test data should ideally stem from the same source and distribution. However, in the real world, this is not always feasible. Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques address this issue by adapting a classifier trained on annotated source domain data on unannotated target domain data while minimizing the impact of domain shift. Many recent DA approaches concentrate on learning a latent feature space that remains invariant to domain shift by mitigating various statistical and geometrical divergences. Although these methods have demonstrated effectiveness, they frequently overlook a crucial aspect of learning a domain invariant discriminative latent feature space across diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Unified Framework for Visual Domain Adaptation with Covariance Matching (UDACM) that aims to learn a domain invariant and class discriminative latent feature space by incorporating multiple objectives such as maximizing target domain variance, minimizing distribution and subspace divergence, performing manifold learning, preserving discriminative information of both the source and target domains, and measuring and matching covariance simultaneously. In our proposed framework, the measuring and matching of covariance play a crucial role in ensuring the learning of discriminative latent feature space by aligning the within-class and between-class covariance matrices of the source and target domains simultaneously. Detailed experiments demonstrate the outperformance of UDACM on baseline datasets such as CMU-PIE, Office+Caltech10, USPS+MNIST, VLCS, and Office-Home, compared to various established primitive, shallow, and deep domain adaptation methods on several image classification tasks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Gas-Chromatography coupled to Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) based metabolomics is an emerging technique for obtaining fast, reliable untargeted metabolic fingerprints of biofluids. The generated raw data is highly dimensional and complex, suffers from baseline problems, misalignments, long peak tails and strong nonlinearities that must be corrected to extract chemically relevant features from samples. In this work, we present our GCIMS R package, which includes spectra loading, metadata handling, denoising, baseline correction, spectral and chromatographic alignment, peak detection, integration, and peak clustering to produce a peak table ready for multivariate data analysis. We discuss package design decisions, and, for illustration purposes, we show a case study of sex discrimination on the basis of the volatile compounds in urine samples. The GCIMS package provides a user-friendly workflow for non-code developers to process their raw data samples.

AB With the explosion in the number of mobile applications, it becomes difficult and time-consuming for users to find the most suitable and interesting application from the millions of applications that exist today. Therefore, mobile app recommendation becomes a top priority to help people solve this problem. In previous studies, there are two common methods to solve this problem, one is to apply matrix factorization to the rating data to predict the target user's ratings for other applications, and the other is to predict ratings based on the user's review text. In addition to combining the above two traditional methods, this study also combines deep learning methods to generate better models. For rating data, we use a deep matrix factorization method to obtain latent factor vectors of users and items from the rating matrix to improve the embedding of ratings. For review text, we improve the text representation by using a multi-embedding approach. Most importantly, our model also incorporates deep neural networks with nonlinear transformation capabilities to extract more representative abstract features. We conduct experiments on datasets collected from the real world. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method has better performance than other existing methods.

ID OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB Error-bounded piecewise linear approximation (1.0-PLA) has been proven effective in addressing challenges in data management and analytics. It works by approximating the original time series with linear segments such that the approximation error on each data point does not exceed a pre-defined threshold. To achieve this goal, most prior works on 1.0-PLA use a fixed error threshold during the entire approximation process, assuming a stable time series. However, in many real-world applications, the distribution of values on the time series undergoes substantial changes in different temporal stages. This introduces a need to adaptively tune the error threshold based on the properties of the time series while considering the trade-off between representation error and storage resources. In this work, we propose a general framework for constructing 1.0- PLA with adaptive error bounds (AEPLA). It works by dividing the original time series into a set of intervals and assigns adaptive error bounds to these sub-sequences based on their fluctuation levels. Next, these subsequences are approximated using a user-defined 1.0-PLA method. We implement this framework by employing three different types of 1.0-PLA methods and evaluate the performance of our approach on an extensive set of real-world time-series datasets from industrial and scientific domains. Our experiments show that constructing 1.0-PLA using the AEPLA framework can provide better a trade-off between representation error and storage resources and achieves lower time and space costs than applying the original 1.0-PLA methods.

AB Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3D shapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturing non-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in the mesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularly challenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressed through CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformers have gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achieving performance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-sought architecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-based method for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling of the graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. In order to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures in modeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3D meshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positional encoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacing the traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducing clustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attention operators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG Dataset (Wang et al., 2012), on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al. (2017) and on the ShapeNet benchmark (Chang et al., 2015), show how the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.

This research proposes the guidelines of a Decision Support System (DSS) in the area of crowdfunding based on a Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) approach. A framework consisting of three phases (ten steps) has been proposed to design the guidelines of a DSS in crowdfunding. The first phase focusses in the construction of the FCM. FCMbased scenarios have been built in the second phase. Finally, in the third phase the guidelines of the DSS in crowdfunding have been defined. Results show that DSS using FCM-based scenarios could be useful tools to promoters, funders and managers of crowdfunding projects.

AB The evolution towards smart grids (SGs) is mainly characterized by the integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) throughout the grid. The intermittent nature of these sources necessitated the installation of energy storage systems (ESSs) to improve the efficiency and reliability in the power system. Moreover, the ongoing high price of batteries has encouraged the installation of shared ESSs in residential communities. However, managing the shared ESS and the energy flows in the community is considered a key challenge. In order to handle this issue, we introduce a novel energy management system (EMS), namely Energy Management In residential COmmunities with shared storage based on multi-agent systems (EMICO). It finds the optimal energy trading operations between households, as well as the operations of the shared ESS that minimize the total energy losses. We first propose a new cluster-based architecture for the residential community in which we integrate Internet of Energy (IoE) devices to manage energy flows and find the shortest path to transfer energy with minimal loss from a cluster to the other. Then, we model our energy management problem as a constrained optimization problem and we use Lagrange multiplier method to solve it in a centralized way. In order to preserve households' privacy, we propose a decentralized approach based on multi-agent systems (MASs) to solve our problem. We test our approach on real data traces obtained from a set of households located in the United Kingdom. Numerical results show that EMICO outperforms a literature approach in terms of energy losses (up to 35.66% of reduction in energy losses), electricity bill (up to 21.21% cheaper), number of exchanged messages (up to 83.81% less messages exchanged), and length of required cables (up to 95.03% less cables required).

AB When reading an online review, consumers rely on implied trust-building factors within it. Trust antecedents have been extensively researched and categorized into argument quality and source credibility. However, there is still a need to investigate how their help for consumers differs across national cultures. Furthermore, while a profile photo has been found to enhance the helpfulness of a review by improving source credibility, little is known about how consumers perceive user appearance in a review picture and no research has compared these two types of visual information. To bridge these gaps, we examine how trust antecedents and visual information help consumers' decision making differently across national cultures, using reviews collected from Amazon in the US and Germany, respectively. Our results show that information quality is more helpful for consumers in an individualistic and low uncertainty avoidance culture, whereas source credibility is more valued in the opposite culture. Interestingly, the effects of the two types of visual information, user appearance in a profile photo versus in a review picture, also differ across cultures. This research contributes to the online review literature by introducing visual information and national culture with new perspectives of trust. Our findings suggest that multinational e-commerce businesses adopt culture-specific strategies in review systems to better help consumers make informed purchase decisions.

AB The enhancement of manufacturing processes due to the growing demand for products and services is a problem that must be constantly updated. Several schemas have been conducted to improve the manufacturing processes. These schemas are based on the flexible use of machines, tools, and tool access directions to determine the best process planning (PP) for a specific piece or part. The combination of different tools and machines leads to the formulation of complicated combinatory problems that can be treated as optimization problems. On the other hand, bioinspired optimization techniques have been widely employed for solving several complex engineering and real-life problems showing competitive results. The crow search algorithm (CSA) is an optimization technique based on the intelligent foraging behavior of crows. Our work uses an improved CSA (ICSA) to determine the optimal flexible process planning (FPP) with a low computational effort. Several AND/OR networks FPP problems are employed in the experimentation stage, where the production cost and production time are considered as fitness functions. To determine the performance and accuracy of the proposed technique, different results previously reported in the literature are used for a comparison showing that ICSA-FPP is able to outperform similar approaches.

AB E-commerce's rapid growth, combined with customer demand for fast shipping, has significantly escalated last mile transportation, particularly home deliveries. This surge calls for novel strategies to optimize vehicle utilization while maintaining timely delivery. In response, many online retailers are incentivizing customers to embrace delayed home deliveries by offering economic incentives. Nonetheless, current transportation systems fall short in accommodating orders with extended delivery windows, primarily adhering to the First-In-First-Out rule and distance minimization via the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). In this paper, we introduce a new consolidation-based delivery methodology that addresses these challenges. Our approach accounts for orders with daily-based time windows and also anticipates future demand realizations (i.e., expected incoming orders). We characterize this consolidation problem using a Mixed Integer Linear Programming model and propose a custom metaheuristic approach that can tackle the problem on a large-scale setting, introducing a significant novelty approach in last-mile delivery research. We applied our methodology to one of Mexico's largest retailers and compared its performance against the company's existing transportation systems. Our approach substantially improves vehicle utilization and yields considerable reductions in distance traveled, time, and overall transportation costs, achieving cost savings of up to 52%. These savings represent tangible benefits, enabling potential revenue enhancements for businesses and cost-effective, timely deliveries for consumers. Additionally, the increased vehicle utilization implies fewer vehicles are needed for the same volume of deliveries, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. This innovative approach, therefore, presents a practical and highly effective solution for managing large-scale last-mile delivery scenarios.

AB The first step in petrographic image analysis is to segment the mineral grains in the thin section petrographic image, allowing the petrographer to identify the rock based on the grain size and composition. The purpose of this research is to present an automated computer vision solution for obtaining accurate and efficient edge segmentation maps. The proposed model, termed the extinction consistency perception network, is made up of three sections. The multi-angle extinction consistency block, which is based on the extinction consistency of mineral grains, uses consecutive petrographic images to generate edgeenhanced features. Then they are processed by the multi-scale edge perception network to obtain rich expression of edge features at different levels. Afterward, a distance-map penalized compound loss function is introduced to guide the model to pay more attention to grains' edges. The generated cross-polarized petrographic image dataset (CPPID) with meticulous annotations has been shared with the community. Experimental findings show that the proposed model is effective, which is evaluated on CPPID and scores 0.940 ODS and 0.941 OIS, outperforming seven classic edge detection models by a large margin.

ID NETWORK
AB Fully-supervised semantic segmentation methods are difficult to generalize to novel objects, and their fine-tuning often requires a sufficient number of fully-labeled images. Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) has recently attracted lots of attention due to its excellent capability for segmenting the novel object with only a few labeled images. Most of recent approaches follow the prototype learning paradigm and have made a significant improvement in segmentation performance. However, there exist two critical bottleneck problems to be solved. (1) Previous methods mainly focus on mining the foreground information of the target object, and class-specific prototypes are generated by solely leveraging average operation on the whole support image, which may lead to information loss, underutilization, or semantic confusion of the object. (2) Most existing methods unilaterally guide the object segmentation in the query image with support images, which may result in semantic misalignment due to the diversity of objects in the support and query sets. To alleviate the above challenging problems, we propose a simple yet effective joint guidance learning architecture to generate and align more compact and robust prototypes from two aspects. (1) We propose a coarse-to-fine prototype generation module to generate coarse-grained foreground prototypes and fine-grained background prototypes. (2) We design a joint guidance learning module for the prototype evaluation and optimization on both support and query images. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve superior segmentation results on PASCAL-5i\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$<^>{i}$$\end{document} and COCO-20i\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\usepackage{amsmath}\usepackage{wasysym}\usepackage{amsfonts}\usepackage{amssymb}\usepackage{amsbsy}\usepackage{mathrsfs}\usepackage{upgreek}\setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\begin{document}$$<^>{i}$$\end{document} datasets.

AB This paper proposes a design scheme for a whole morphing strategy based on the reinforcement learning (RL) method. A novel morphing aircraft is designed, and its nonlinear dynamic equations are established based on the calculated aerodynamic data. Further, a soft actor critic (SAC) approach is utilized to design the scheme, whose structure consists of the environment, the agent, and the reward function. In the environment design part, the incremental backstepping approach is employed to design the morphing aircraft controller. The safety and feasibility of deployment are verified. In the agent design part, in addition to using the entropy regularization RL algorithm, the generalization ability of the agent is enhanced in three ways: adding environmental noise, adding control command randomness, and adding output momentum terms. For the reward function, a structure with dynamic and steady-state performance is designed to accurately describe the aircraft dynamics. Finally, the designed SAC strategy is verified under the acceleration and deceleration tasks and compared with a GA and PPO strategy. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the designed SAC scheme.

AB In recent years, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction has gained superiority when compared with traditional methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel point-attention network, with an attention mechanism, based on the point cloud structure. During the reconstruction process, our method with an attention mechanism can guide the network to pay more attention to complex areas such as thin structures and low-texture surfaces. We first infer a coarse depth map using a modified classical MVS deep framework and convert it into the corresponding point cloud. Then, we add the high-frequency features and different-resolution features of the raw images to the point cloud. Finally, our network guides the weight distribution of points in different dimensions through the attention mechanism and computes the depth displacement of each point iteratively as the depth residual, which is added to the coarse depth prediction to obtain the final high-resolution depth map. Experimental results show that our proposed point-attention architecture can achieve a significant improvement in some scenes without reasonable geometrical assumptions on the DTU dataset and the Tanks and Temples dataset, suggesting that our method has a strong generalization ability.

AB The cut slope graben is affected by the lithology of strata, rainfall, and man-made excavation, which is a complex geotechnical system. Deformation of a cut slope changes irregularly with time, and, if too large, the deformation causes geological disasters such as landslides. Thus, it is crucial to establish an accurate slope deformation prediction model for control and safety. We used wavelet decomposition (WD) to process the time series of slope deformation to obtain an approximate series and detailed series. Then to predict each sub-series, we used the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize the number of neurons in the hidden layer, the learning rate, and the number of iterations of a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The prediction results were summed to obtain the final prediction. The hybrid WD-IPSO-LSTM prediction model had a mean absolute error of 0.047, 0.067, and 0.094 at 1, 3, and 6 steps, respectively. These errors were 47.19%, 49.62%, and 57.47% lower than the LSTM-alone model errors. The hybrid WD-IPSO-LSTM prediction model had greater accuracy compared with a back propagation neural network, recurrent neural network, LSTM alone, PSO-LSTM, and IPSO-LSTM in 1-step, 3-step, and 6-step prediction. In addition, our hybrid model for prediction of slope deformation was more realistic and credible compared with other models.

AB Multi-instance learning (MIL) handles data that is organized into sets of instances known as bags. Traditionally, MIL is used in the supervised-learning setting for classifying bags which contain any number of instances. However, many traditional MIL algorithms do not scale efficiently to large datasets. In this paper, we present a novel primal-dual multi-instance support vector machine that can operate efficiently on large-scale data. Our method relies on an algorithm derived using a multi-block variation of the alternating direction method of multipliers. The approach presented in this work is able to scale to large-scale data since it avoids iteratively solving quadratic programming problems which are broadly used to optimize MIL algorithms based on SVMs. In addition, we improve our derivation to include an additional optimization designed to avoid solving a least-squares problem in our algorithm, which increases the utility of our approach to handle a large number of features as well as bags. Finally, we derive a kernel extension of our approach to learn nonlinear decision boundaries for enhanced classification capabilities. We apply our approach to both synthetic and real-world multi-instance datasets to illustrate the scalability, promising predictive performance, and interpretability of our proposed method.

AB The medical industry has employed a variety of decision-making methods to help medical professionals. The use of fuzzy techniques is necessitated by the fact that medical data is often ambiguous. This study desires to show the decision-making application of a novel Pythagorean Fuzzy Cognitive Map (PFCM) in the treatment of pregnant women with heart disease. The PFCM integrates the principles of Pythagorean fuzzy sets with cognitive maps, resulting in a better intuitive model for human understanding. PFCM combines Pythagorean Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, determining weights for expert opinions and criteria. It yields a fuzzy cognitive map with weighted linkages to visualize relationship strengths. To measure the impact of the PFCM, we conduct a hypothetical case study in which women were assumed to have cardiovascular disease. We gathered input values, diagnosis, and prognosis data and used them to design an algorithm that demonstrates the complete working of the system. After completing the algorithm, we validate the model using some example values and compared the accuracy obtained with other techniques. Our findings show that the PFCM is a highly accurate and effective tool for decision-making in the treatment of pregnant women with heart disease. The present study offers new insights into the use of Pythagorean fuzzy cognitive maps and their potential for improving decision-making in healthcare.

AB Air pollution causes a pivotal impact throughout the world that affects natural resources. It also makes hazardous damage to the environment and defects in human health. The World Health Organization states that the report of air pollution is the major reason of human ailments such as lung cancer, early death, asthma, premature birth, and stroke. Due to the influence of changes in weather and climate caused by air pollution, global warming, acid rain, rainfall declines and depletion of the ozone layer occur. To mitigate these issues, preventive measures for air quality are prerequisites. Therefore, air quality monitoring is considered the main aspect of acquiring decision-making support that yields accurate predictions. In addition, there is a need of evaluating the quality of ambient (outdoor) air depending on the observations of pollutants. To achieve this, an automated air quality prediction model is proposed by using modified probability ratio-based RSA (MPR-RSA) and ensemble-based air quality prediction (EAQP). In the first step, the input data are undergone the preprocessing step. The preprocessing is done through various methods such as data imputation, data cleansing, and data transformation. Then, the preprocessed data are given to extract the significant features. The extracted features are obtained by statistical features, spatial features, and temporal features. To enhance the predictive accuracy, the weighted feature selection is employed, where the weight parameter is optimized by the proposed MPR-RSA algorithm. Then, the classification process is accomplished by EAQP, where the hyper-parameters are optimized by the same MPR-RSA algorithm. Here, the ensemble model is constructed by a single Prediction approach as support vector regression, recurrent neural network, extreme learning, bi-directional long short-term memory, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. Finally, the performance is analyzed with various parameters to prove that the proposed model becomes an advanced air quality prediction. Throughout the analysis, the RMSE of the proposed model achieves 9.96%, which can be a lesser value than the other existing heuristic algorithms. Hence, the proposed prediction model attains the low value of RMSE and MAE, which offers early forecasts of ambient air pollution to evade the damage and impacts to the environment.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Multi-objective optimization problems require the simultaneous optimization of more than one objective function. Image segmentation algorithm partitions an image into different parts according to its features and properties. It is essentially a multi-objective optimization problem because of multiple requirements. Multi-objective evolutionary fuzzy clustering (MOEFC) algorithms behave much better than traditional fuzzy clustering algorithms due to considering several cluster indices and automatically determining the number of clusters. When applied to image segmentation, MOEFC algorithms generally consume a long running time and cannot well preserve the region-level information in images. To solve these problems and meanwhile utilize some prior information derived from images to further improve the performance of MOEFC algorithms, this paper proposes a multiple population-based multi-objective evolutionary semi-supervised multi-kernel region fuzzy clustering image segmentation. First, effective region features considering color, texture and spatial information are extracted. Next, region-level-based semi-supervised fitness functions are designed using the obtained region features and some propagation supervision information. Further, in order to effectively aggregate image features, the constructed fitness functions are extended to a non-linear version utilizing a multi-kernel function. Then, a multi-population evolutionary strategy is adopted to improve the diversity of population. Except for the traditional crossover and mutation operators, the recombination operator between two populations and a center updating based elitist strategy are designed. Finally, a multiple kernel evaluation index with region information and propagation supervision information is constructed to select an optimal solution from the non-dominant solution set. Experimental results on several image datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation performance and running efficiency.

AB In the shipbuilding industry, nesting is arranging the cutting patterns of ship parts to increase the utilization rate of steel sheets and reduce the scrap rate. The nesting complexity is high because of the large number of ship parts with complex shapes and various sizes. Arrangement algorithms for minimizing steel-sheet wastage cannot be readily applied to nesting without pairing the two parts to reduce the nesting complexity because of the considerable computation time involved. This study proposes a pairing method to reduce nesting complexity. Ship parts were classified, and pairwise clustering was applied for pairing. A method in which a deep neural network architecture learns polygons without rasterization for classifying ship parts and a method for pairing ship parts of different shapes for pairwise clustering were proposed. Using 265 actual ship parts, the proposed method was compared with pairing methods involving shape-based matching algorithms currently employed by shipbuilding companies. Subsequently, 82 more parts were paired, and the average pairing time, arrangement time, and scrap rate decreased by 44.1%, 47.5%, and 11.0%, respectively. Pairing based on deep learning classifiers and pairwise clustering can rapidly and accurately pair ship parts, thereby improving nesting efficiency.

AB An extended Jaffrey-Hamel problem with heat and mass transfer attributes of viscoelastic fluid over an isothermal porous conduit, where the flow is produced by injecting the fluid at the inlet of the convergent section, has been described. The homogeneous processes dictated by first-order kinetics take place in the adjacent fluid, whereas the heterogeneous reactions supplied by cubic autocatalytic dynamics are believed to take place on the channel wall. To simulate both inertial drag and bulk permeable drag of the porosity medium, a non-Darcy-drag force concept is used. Slow velocity leads to the disregarding of viscous dissipation. Thermal radiation and a heat source or sink work together to keep the temperature in equilibrium in the flow domain. The simulation-based numerical solutions for dimensionless temperature, velocity, and concentration have been derived by applying appropriate similarity transformations to the highly nonlinear momentum equation, thermal, and species concentration equations. A more secure velocity profile results from a longer strain retardation time and a shorter stress relaxation time, whereas both viscoelastic times have reverse consequences. The thermal distribution is quantitatively improved with an increase in the radiation parameter, suggesting a higher rate of heat transmission. Concentration drops as heterogeneous reaction parameters are amplified . With an increase in the porosity number, surface viscous drag becomes more intense. Divergent cross section shows a greater tendency for heat and mass transfer.

AB Breast Cancer (BC) has been increasing in incidence among women for a variety of reasons, and prompt detection and management are essential to reducing mortality rates. In the context of clinical-level breast cancer screening, the needle biopsy sample is used to generate Breast Histology Images (BHIs), which will then be used to confirm the results. Using a novel Deep-Learning Plan (DLP), the proposed work identifies BHI accurately and confirms the severity of BC by confirming its severity. As part of the proposed DLP implementation, four phases are involved: (i) the collection and enhancement of images, (ii) the extraction of features, (iii) the reduction of features and their integration, and (iv) binary classification and validation. The purpose of this study is to optimize deep features and machine features using particle swarm algorithms. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we compare the results obtained using individual deep features, dual deep features, and hybrid features. Using the hybrid image features in the classifier, this study has determined that ResNet18 with k-nearest neighbor provides superior classification accuracy (> 94%).

AB Due to the strengths of zeroing neural network (ZNN) in dealing with time-varying problems and the advantages of fuzzy logic system (FLS) in uncertain computing, a fixed-time convergence fuzzy ZNN (FTCFZNN) model realized by the FLS with dynamic membership functions is proposed for solving time-varying Sylvester equation (TVSE). The introduction of the dynamic membership functions in the FLS is one of the most meaningful attributes of this paper, and such a FLS is called the dynamic FLS (DFLS). The design parameter of the FTCFZNN model is the fuzzy parameter generated by the DFLS. Meanwhile, the fuzzy parameter is also employed in the proposed adaptive activation function, which makes the FTCFZNN model possess fixed-time convergence with less upper bound and has a better adaptable ability. Moreover, a series of theoretical analyses reflect the superior fixed-time convergence and adaptive robustness of the FTCFZNN model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the predominant performance of the FTCFZNN model and its effectiveness in solving the TVSE compared with serval existing ZNN models. Finally, the FTCFZNN model is applied to realize the consensus of multi-agent systems, which shows the application value of the FTCFZNN model.

AB Rapid urbanization and industrialization have led to considerable changes in China and now there is a need for effective development of industrial land use morphology rather than extensive. Thus, the characteristics and driving mechanism of industrial land use morphology (ILUM) must be recognized to address the shortage of construction land supply and green development. However, the existing research has not comprehensively measured the industrial landform and explored its impact mechanism. Based on the balanced panel data of 268 cities in China from 2003 to 2018, this study analyzes the driving mechanisms of ILUM to construct an index system to measure ILUM from dominant and recessive aspects. The geographic and time-weighted regression model was used to explore the spatiotemporal impacts of ILUM in different regions. The results show that the value of industrial land-use dominant morphology presents a slow upward trend. Taking 2013 as the dividing line, the value of industrial land-use recessive morphology presents a trend of rapid growth and then relatively slow growth. There are obvious regional heterogeneous effects of industrial evolution, environmental regulation, and government intervention on ILUM. There is a need to develop differentiated industrial development and environmental governance strategies based on regional development, guiding the transformation of industrial land morphology intensively and efficiently.

AB Wearable recognition systems based on flexible electronics present immense potential for applications in human-machine interfaces, medical care, soft robots, etc. However, they experience challenges in terms of the nonideal consistency and stability of flexible sensors, which are responsible for detecting physical signals from human motions. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition precision and capability in the wearable systems. Furthermore, the computational consumption for the recognition increases as more sensors are used to extensively gather information for distinguishing between complex motions. Herein, a wearable recognition system based on deep-learning-enhanced strain sensors for distinguishing between the complex motions of the human body is presented. A strain sensor based on peak-valley microstructures is fabricated and packaged to improve consistency and stability. Moreover, a lightweight hybrid convolutional neural network long short-term memory model is designed to lower the computational costs of the deep learning process. In particular, by designing Butterworth filtering and Z-score normalization algorithms, the error in feature extraction caused by sensor signal fluctuation is reduced, thereby improving the recognition accuracy of the proposed wearable system to 95.72% for seven gait motions and 100% for four different continuous series of Tai Chi forms.

ID ENSEMBLE
AB GPT-3 is a large-scale natural language model developed by OpenAI that can perform many different tasks, including topic classification. Although researchers claim that it requires only a small number of in-context examples to learn a task, in practice GPT-3 requires these training examples to be either of exceptional quality or a higher quantity than easily created by hand. To address this issue, this study teaches GPT-3 to classify whether a question is related to data science by augmenting a small training set with additional examples generated by GPT-3 itself. This study compares two augmented classifiers: the Classification Endpoint with an increased training set size and the Completion Endpoint with an augmented prompt optimized using a genetic algorithm. We find that data augmentation significantly increases the accuracy of both classifiers, and that the embedding-based Classification Endpoint achieves the best accuracy of about 76%, compared to human accuracy of 85%. In this way, giving large language models like GPT-3 the ability to propose their own training examples can improve short text classification performance.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; DIVERSITY; SELECTION; MOPSO
AB In multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), several mutually conflicting objectives are optimized simultaneously. In such scenarios, there is not a unique solution to the problem; instead, there is a set of solutions known as the Pareto front, representing the trade-off between objectives. Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can approximate these solutions in a single run. However, due to their resource-intensive nature, MOEAs are not suitable for solving real-time and engineering MOPs such as the optimization of manufacturing processes and energy consumption in wireless networks, where a fast convergence rate with less computational cost is required. Fortunately, micro versions of MOEAs can meet this requirement by utilizing a tiny population size. However, this can result in a rapid loss of diversity and the algorithm may easily fall into a local optimum. While some approaches such as the restart technique have been proposed to address this issue, hybrid techniques such as integrative, collaborative, and decomposition-based methods have not been effectively considered in the design of micro algorithms, despite hybridization being a widely accepted method for enhancing the diversity of evolutionary algorithms. In this study, we propose a hybrid micro MOEA called mu MOSM that can effectively tackle the diversity loss problem and accelerate the convergence rate in approximating Pareto front solutions. Experimental results on benchmark test suites and a real-world MOP demonstrate the advantages of our proposed algorithm and confirm that mu MOSM outperforms state-of-the-art MOEAs and micro MOEAs such as MOSM, ADE-MOIA, MMOPSO, NSGA-III, MOEA/D-FRRMAB, mu FAME, and ASMiGA.

AB The location problem of organic waste collection and recycling plants is a significant concern for policy makers in developing countries. Factors such as rapid population growth, unplanned urbanization, and limited resources pose challenges to the efficient management of organic waste. Inadequate waste disposal practices not only endanger the environment and human health but also hinder the development of sustainable and livable cities. Therefore, it is crucial to address the specific challenges associated with locating organic waste collection and recycling facilities to ensure effective waste management and promote environmental sustainability. This study aims to identify the most appropriate location for an organic waste collection and recycling facility for compost production. This study involves identifying the most influential aspects of organic waste collection and recycling center location selection through a literature review and expert opinion. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology with fuzzy interval type-2 (T2F) sets is employed to weight the criteria. The COmbinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) approach is extended in a T2F environment to better reflect the uncertainty and evaluate the alternative locations. The study concludes by revealing the optimal location for the food waste collection center for Trabzon city in Turkiye. To verify the validity and reliability of the proposed integrated methodology, a comparative analysis was also performed using various decision-making methods.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Brain tumour diagnosis is significant for both physicians and patients, but the low contrast and the artefacts of MRI glioma images always affect the diagnostic accuracy. The existing mainstream image enhancement methods are insufficient in improving contrast and suppressing artefacts simultaneously. To enrich the field of glioma image enhancement, this research proposed a glioma image enhancement method based on histogram modification and total variational using stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm. Firstly, this method modifies the cumulative distribution function on the image histogram and performs gamma correction on the image according to the modified histogram to obtain a contrast-enhanced image. Then, the method suppresses the artefacts of glioma images by total variational and wavelet denoising algorithm. To get better enhancement images, the optimal parameters in the proposed method are searched by the SPGD algorithm. The statistical studies performed on 580 real glioma images demonstrate that the authors' approach can outperform the existing mainstream image enhancement methods. The results show that the proposed method increases the discrete entropy of the image by 8.9% and the contrast by 2.8% compared to original images. The enhanced images are produced by the proposed method with a natural appearance, appealing contrast, less degradation, and reasonable detail preservation.
   To enrich the field of glioma image enhancement, this paper proposed a glioma image enhancement framework based on histogram modification and total variational using stochastic parallel gradient descent (SPGD) algorithm. The results show that the proposed framework has superior performance compared to several existing glioma image enhancement methods. image

AB Selection mechanisms based on performance indicators are popular for solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), which can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the convergence and diversity of candidate solutions. However, these mechanisms recently encounter difficulties when tackling computationally expensive MOPs attributed to the restricted quantity of real function evaluations. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a Kriging-assisted indicator-based evolutionary algorithm. The primary concept is to utilize the Kriging model to approximate computationally expensive objective functions, thereby reducing the computational cost, and to employ the R2 indicator to assess the quality of candidate solutions. In addition, a dual selection mechanism based on the lower confidence bound is proposed as the model management strategy to balance exploration and exploitation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive when compared to five representative algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The human error factor is one of the leading causes of medical errors. Among risk analysis techniques for human error factors, HFACS (Human Factor Analysis and Classification System) method has been regarded as one of the most valuable approaches due to its advantage in potential failure classification. However, the conventional HFACS method is insufficient to handle the risk analysis problem for human error factors considering the interactive relationship among these factors. Moreover, the current fuzzy HFACS frameworks cannot address quantitative risk analysis issues, including imprecision and reliability of information. Thus, this paper constructs an integrated linguistic Z-number-based HFACS framework for analyzing the risk of human error factors. This framework can capture the uncertainty and reliability of the risk evaluation information and the interactive relationships among factors. First, the linguistic Z-number-DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) method is used to generate the comprehensive risk matrix of human error factors identified by the HFACS method. Then, an extended linguistic Z-number-ORESTE method based on the score function is presented to prioritize the risk of human error factors, which can show the preference, indifference, and incomparability relationship among human error factors. Finally, a case study of a healthcare system is conducted to illustrate the reliability of the proposed method. The result of this case indicates that inadequate resources are the most severe risk. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis indicate the necessity of considering the effect of the semantics of language terms and the interrelationships between human error factors on risk analysis results. These results show that the proposed hybrid framework is a reliable means to analyze the risk of human error factors within the HFACS method.

DT Article
DE Source-free unsupervised domain; adaptation; Pseudo labeling
AB Due to privacy concerns and data transmission issues, Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFDA) has gained popularity. It exploits pre-trained source models, rather than raw source data for target learning, to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing methods solve this problem typically with additional parameters or noisy pseudo labels, and we propose an effective method named Proxy-based Mixup training with label refinery (ProxyMix) to avoid these drawbacks. To avoid additional parameters and leverages information in the source model, ProxyMix defines classifier weights as class prototypes and creates a class-balanced proxy source domain using nearest neighbors of the prototypes. To improve the reliability of pseudo labels, we further propose the frequency-weighted aggregation strategy to generate soft pseudo labels for unlabeled target data. Our strategy utilizes target features' internal structure, increases weights of low frequency class samples, and aligns the proxy and target domains using inter-and intra-domain mixup regularization. This mitigates the negative impact of noisy labels. Experiments on three 2D image and 3D point cloud object recognition benchmarks demonstrate that ProxyMix yields state-of-the-art performance for source-free UDA tasks. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The accuracy of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms can be improved by combining several deep learners into an ensemble. This avoids the continuous endeavor required to adjust the architecture of individual networks or the nature of the propagation. This study investigates prediction improvements possible using Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) to determine four distinct multiscale basis functions in the mixed Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM), involving the permeability field as the only input. 376,250 samples were initially generated, filtered down to 367,811 after data pre-processing. A standard Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named SkiplessCNN and three skip connection-based CNNs named FirstSkipCNN, MidSkipCNN, and DualSkipCN N were developed for the base learners. For each basis function, these fou r CNNs were combined into an ensemble model using linear regression and ridge regression, separately, as part of the stacking technique. A comparison of the coefficient of determination (R2) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) confirms the effectiveness of a l l three skip connections in enhancing the performance of the standard CNN, with DualSkip being the most effective among them. Additionally, as evaluated on the testing subset, the combined models meaningfully outperform the individual models for a l l basis functions. The case that applies linear regression delivers R2 ranging from 0.8456 to 0.9191 and MSE ranging from 0.0092 to 0.0369. The ridge regression case achieves marginally better predictions with R2 ranging from 0.8539 to 0.922, and MSE ranging from 0.009 to 0.0349 because its solution involves more evenly distributed weights.

ID DETECTION SYSTEM
AB Driver fatigue detection is critical for preventing traffic accidents. However, in real driving scenarios, low-quality input situations often occur due to occlusion, large-turn head deformation, and inconsistent eye states, which introduce noise and degrade the performance of single-stream networks. To address this, we propose a multistream facial feature fusion convolution neural network (FFF-CNN) that enhances performance on low-quality inputs. The FFF-CNN includes a global face stream and two local eye streams, with feature fusion used for eye state classification. To facilitate feature fusion, we implemented two preprocessing modules, the feature attention module (FAM) and the stream interaction module (SIM). FAM emphasizes important features in the global face stream, while SIM corrects information from the two local eye streams. The proposed FFF-CNN achieved good performance on both our dataset and the public Closed Eyes in the Wild (CEW) dataset. Compared to singlestream networks, the FFF-CNN improved performance by 4.95% and 4.27% on our dataset and the CEW dataset, respectively. Furthermore, it achieved state-of-the-art performance on the CEW dataset with an accuracy of 98.35%. The effectiveness of the proposed FAM and SIM has been verified by experiments. Notably, our experimental results show that the proposed FFF-CNN effectively improved fatigue detection performance on low-quality input, approaching the performance on normal situations.

AB Domain adaptation provides the possibility of utilizing the knowledge gained from an auxiliary domain to accomplish the task in another related domain. In this paper, a common feature representation of these domains is learned through a new proposed idea to reduce inter-domain differences more precisely which results in higher accuracy for unsupervised domain adaptation. To decrease these divergences, the proposed method finds a subspace that reduces data distribution discrepancy between domains. To achieve this goal, minimization of the divergence of the class conditional probability distributions is considered. By considering class conditional distributions, more discriminative information of data is preserved compared to applying marginal distributions. Also, an explicit parametric distribution of the source and target domains is considered to reduce the discrepancy between the two domains data which results in higher accuracy compared to the other relevant domain adaptation methods. Experimental studies on benchmark image classification tasks confirmed our assumptions and indicated the significant improvement given by the proposed method compared to the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Fiber-optic hydrophones based on optical fiber sensing and communication technology have developed rapidly in recent years. With the advantages of high sensitivity, small size, and large dynamic range, they are easy to detect underwater acoustic signals, showing great potential in the field of marine ecological protection. Researchers can monitor the marine ecological environment by recognizing underwater optical fiber sensing signals collected by fiber-optic hydrophones in real-time. Deep learning models can achieve high recognition accuracy, but they usually have large amounts of parameters that makes them difficult to be deployed in mobile terminals of marine survey ships. To solve the key problem, this paper discussed the design of the Deep Light-Weight Attention Residual Network (DLA-ResNet). It introduces the depth-wise separable convolution (DSC) and the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) into ResNet18 to make its performance better. ResNet18 is a two-dimensional convolutional network (CNN) model applying residual blocks. Experiments verify that the accuracy of DLA-ResNet improved from ResNet18 is increased by about 2.04% and its size is reduced by 85.67%. The proposed scheme in this paper realizes an average recognition rate of 96.50% for eight types of underwater optical fiber sensing signals in the application of marine ecological environment monitoring. Moreover, its model size is only 6.12 MB and it only takes 27.90 ms, which is available to meet the needs of reliability and effectiveness.

AB Optical Character Recognition (OCR) poses a crucial challenge within the realm of computer vision research, as it plays a pivotal role in converting vast amounts of unstructured text data into structured formats to support diverse artificial intelligence applications. The OCR process encompasses two core components: text detection and text recognition. Text detection involves identifying and extracting text regions, achieved through either object detection or segmentation techniques, while text recognition focuses on accurately deciphering the content within these identified regions. In recent years, remarkable strides have been made in the domain of text recognition, primarily driven by deep learning-based models. These models eliminate the need for manual feature processing and excel in recognizing text even within complex scenes, surpassing the performance of traditional text recognition methods and subsequently emerging as the dominant approach. The objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey of both text detection and text recognition models. Firstly, we systematically categorize and provide an overview of existing off-the-shelf text detection methods. Subsequently, we conduct an in-depth investigation of six distinct text recognition models, taking into account their unique implementations. Additionally, we explore and analyze the principal datasets that currently prevail in the field of text detection and recognition. Furthermore, this research entails a meticulous performance comparison of various text detection algorithms on the CTW1500, TotalText, and ICDAR2015 datasets. Additionally, we evaluate and scrutinize the efficacy of mainstream text recognition algorithms on the IIIT-5K, SVT, ICDAR2013, SVT-P, CUTE80, and ICDAR2015 datasets. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the future development and research trends concerning text detection and recognition, providing insights that can further drive progress in this crucial area.

DE Medical image classification; Federated learning; Deep learning
AB Medical data sharing across institutes is crucial to large-scale multi-center studies and the development of realworld AI applications but suffers from serious privacy issues. A promising solution to address this challenge is federated learning, which typically aggregates a global model from heterogeneous data spread across numerous clients without exchanging data. However, the traditional federated learning algorithm (i.e., FedAvg) merely aggregates the locally distributed models according to the amount of data on each client and lacks the consideration of data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Reweighting (FedAR) algorithm for medical image classification. FedAR employs a flexible re-weighting scheme that can balance adaptively the contributions of the amount of data and the performance of the local model on each client to the weight of that client. Specifically, we allow the amount of local data to contribute more to the weight of each client in the early training stage and let the performance of the local model play a more important role in the late stage. We have evaluated the proposed FedAR algorithm against the locally trained model, globally trained baseline, and two existing federated learning algorithms on the ISIC2018 dataset and Chest X-ray14 dataset under the settings with a variable number of clients. Our results suggest that FedAR is an effective federated learning algorithm that substantially outperforms existing federated learning approaches.

DE Next POI recommendation; Transformer; Graph neural network
AB With the increasing prevalence of location-based services, Point of Interest (POI) recommendation has become an active research topic. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in POI recommendation models, they suffer from computational efficiency limitations when the graph structure is large. In this paper, we propose a new next POI recommendation model, which is backboned by a lightweight, feature-based POI grouping (FPG) method and a Transformer network. A unique feature of the proposed model is it uses the FPG method, which divides POIs into multiple groups based on their geographical and popularity features and analyze the similarity among the users' preferences on the groups. By using the FPG method rather than graph-based structures, the proposed model largely reduces the computational cost in making next POI recommendation. The POI embeddings generated by the FPG method are then fed into a Transformer to generate the recommendation result. We test the proposed model on three real-world datasets and conduct comprehensive comparison studies to validate the performance of the model. The experiment results show that the proposed model has superior computational efficiency while preserving sufficient next POI recommendation accuracy. Key findings and critical implications from the experiment result and the mechanistic design of the model are also discussed in detail. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Comprehending why an artificial intelligence-based agent makes certain predictions is often discussed as one of the central issues that needs to be solved in the near future to make such agents ubiquitously deployable. However, many common black-box machine learning models are hard to analyse. Recently, we proposed a new machine learning algorithm to construct concise sets of rules. This algorithm, SupRB, creates compact, interpretable and transparent models. One key feature that differentiates it from many similar previously proposed systems is that it optimizes the model selection tasks concerning rule discovery and rule set composition separately. Therefore, users can tailor a model's structure more easily towards fulfilling use-case specific explainability requirements. Keeping the model selection tasks separate during optimization allows for more clearly defined goals when compared to state-of-the-art systems and - importantly - facilitates independent rule fitnesses, making the training process easier to explain and the models easier to analyse post-hoc. In this paper, we extend previous benchmarking of SupRB, where it was compared with XCSF, a prominent rule set learning system, to also include Decision Trees (DTs) and Random Forests (RFs) in our analysis. We find that - as expected - SupRB performs comparable to XCSF, while allowing easier control of model structure and showing a substantially smaller sensitivity to random seeds and data splits, and it performs slightly worse than RFs, and better than DTs. Importantly, the overall model size was substantially smaller with SupRB, making it the easiest to interpret system while not falling significantly short in terms of prediction errors.

AB Multimodal biometric recognition has attracted intensive attention due to its significant performance improvement for personal authentication by exploiting multiple resources of data. However, most existing multimodal biometric recognition methods tend to fuse completely different biometric traits, making them hard to explore the complementary features of the multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a new multimodal biometric descriptor by jointly learning the multi-type collaborative features of multi-modality finger-knuckle-print (FKP) images. First, we form multi-type feature vectors to capture the texture and direction patterns of the multimodal FKP images. Then, we jointly learn the feature projection to map multi-type vectors into a compact FKP descriptor. Moreover, our method automatically selects the optimal weights for multi-type features during feature learning to make the learned feature codes discriminative. Lastly, we integrate the non-overlapping block-wise histograms of the learned binary codes as the final multimodal FKP feature descriptor. The experimental results conducted on the benchmark PolyU FKP database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for multimodal FKP recognition.

   confidence; Hyperdimensional computing
AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution, which facilitates collaborative learning. However, FL is also vulnerable to poisoning attacks, as it has no control over the participant's behavior. Machine learning (ML) models are heavily trained for low generalization errors. Generative models learn the patterns in the input data to discover out-of-distribution samples, which can be used to poison the model, thereby degrading its performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to generate poisoned (adversarial) samples using hyperdimensional computing (HDC), projecting an input sample to a large HD space and perturbing it in the vicinity of the target class HDC model. This perturbation preserves the semantics of the original samples and adds hidden backdoor/noise into it. It generates a large set of adversarial samples equal to the HD space. It is observed that a trained ML model successfully misclassifies 60%-70% of the generated samples. The adversary uses these samples to frame data poisoning attacks, called hyperdimensional data poisoning attacks (HDPA). HDPA increases the attack impact by 5-10x than existing poisoning attacks against the byzantine-robust defenses. Furthermore, we propose a hyperdimension-based confidence metric (HDBC) to check the model's conformance, which requires neither access to an ML model nor any additional calibration.

ID VERIFICATION; GO
AB Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning (POMCP) is a powerful online algorithm that can generate approximate policies for large Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes. The online nature of this method supports scalability by avoiding complete policy representation. However, the lack of an explicit policy representation hinders interpretability and a proper evaluation of the risks an agent may incur. In this work, we propose a methodology based on Maximum Satisfiability Modulo Theory (MAX-SMT) for analyzing POMCP policies by inspecting their traces, namely, sequences of belief action pairs generated by the algorithm. The proposed method explores local properties of the policy to build a compact and informative summary of the policy behaviour. Moreover, we introduce a rich and formal language that a domain expert can use to describe the expected behaviour of a policy. In more detail, we present a formulation that directly computes the risk involved in taking actions by considering the highlevel elements specified by the expert. The final formula can identify risky decisions taken by POMCP that violate the expert indications. We show that this identification process can be used offline (to improve the policy's explainability and identify anomalous behaviours) or online (to shield the risky decisions of the POMCP algorithm). We present an extended evaluation of our approach on four domains: the well-known tiger and rocksample benchmarks, a problem of velocity regulation in mobile robots, and a problem of battery management in mobile robots. We test the methodology against a state-ofthe-art anomaly detection algorithm to show that our approach can be used to identify anomalous behaviours in faulty POMCP. We also show, comparing the performance of shielded and unshielded POMCP, that the shielding mechanism can improve the system's performance. We provide an open-source implementation of the proposed methodologies at https://github .com /GiuMaz /XPOMCP.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Deep-learning; Feature-extraction; Tabular datasets
AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become effective for various machine learning tasks. DNNs are known to achieve high accuracy with unstructured data in which each data sample (e.g., image) consists of many raw features (e.g., pixels) of the same type. The effectiveness of this approach diminishes for structured (tabular) data. In most cases, decision tree-based models such as Random Forest (RF) or Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) outperform DNNs. In addition, DNNs tend to perform poorly when the number of samples in the dataset is small. This paper introduces Transfer Learning for Tabular Data (TLTD) which utilizes a novel learning architecture designed to extract new features from structured datasets. Using the DNN's learning capabilities on images, we convert the tabular data into images, then use the distillation technique to achieve better learning. We evaluated our approach with 25 structured datasets, and compared the outcomes to those of RF, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Tabnet, KNN, and TabPFN. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the TLTD approach.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In modern energy systems, substations are the core of electricity transmission and distribution. However, similar appearance and small size pose significant challenges for automatic identification of electrical devices. To address these issues, we collect and annotate the substation rotated device dataset (SRDD). Further, feature fusion and feature refinement network (F3RNet) are constructed based on the classic structure pattern of backbone-neck-head. Considering the similar appearance of electrical devices, the deconvolution fusion module (DFM) is designed to enhance the expression of feature information. The balanced feature pyramid (BFP) is embedded to aggregate the global feature. The feature refinement is constructed to adjust the original feature maps by considering the feature alignment between the anchors and devices. It can generate more accurate feature vectors. To address the problem of sample imbalance between electrical devices, the gradient harmonized mechanism (GHM) loss is utilized to adjust the weight of each sample. The ablation experiments are conducted on the SRDD dataset. F3RNet achieves the best detection performance compared with classical object detection networks. Also, it is verified that the features from global feature maps can effectively recognize the similar and small devices.

AB The widely linear estimator offers theoretical and practical advantages over the strictly linear counterpart for the processing of the generality of complex signals. When applying the widely linear technique to a nonlinear estimator of learning systems, the resulting augmented nonlinear estimator also empirically produces performance advantages over the standard (strictly) nonlinear estimator. However, the theoretical justification for this observation is still lacking in the literature. To this end, we establish performance bounds of the augmented nonlinear estimator over the strictly nonlinear one in this paper. By expanding the analytic nonlinear function with the first-order Taylor formula, we obtain the closed form of the MSE difference ? MSE and that of the complementary MSE difference CMSE for the two estimators. By jointly considering the MSE and the complementary MSE, it is theoretically established that ? MSE > 0 always holds for noncircular input signals, and MSE performance advantages always exist in both the real and imaginary channels over its strictly nonlinear counterpart except for the jointly circular case. The simulation results validate our theoretical analysis.

AB Fine-Grained Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (FG-SBIR) is a worthwhile task, which can be useful in many scenarios like recommendation systems, receiving a great deal of attention. In this study, we analyze challenges faced in FG-SBIR and propose a novel Expansion Window Local Alignment Weighted Network (EWLAW-Net). Specifically, it contains two main components: the Expansion Window Local Alignment module (EWLA) and the Local Weighted Fusion module (LWF). The EWLA module adopts an expansion window mechanism to align local features extracted from the backbone with the same semantic meaning between photos and sketches. The LWF module assigns weights to each local feature of the sketch after evaluating their importance and fuses them to calculate the similarity between the sketch and photos for retrieval. Experiments are conducted on five datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

One of effective methods to solve the imbalanced problem is boundary oversampling method, which only focuses on the classification of boundary samples. However, most boundary oversampling methods roughly select boundary samples for oversampling without considering the potentially useful boundary characteristics inherent in majority (negative) class. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel boundary-degree-based oversampling method (BDO) in this paper. The originality of BDO stemps from quantifying the degree to which each negative sample can be regarded as a boundary sample in terms of probability using information entropy. Applying the sigma rule on the quantified boundary degree, negative boundary samples are determined to indirectly select minority (positive) boundary samples for oversampling. In this way, a substantial amount of information hidden in the negative class can be mined. To further transfer the mined information to help oversample, BDO iteratively synthesizes aided boundary points along a fraudulent gradient. Oversampling finally is performed on both positive boundary samples and the aided boundary points. Experimental results completed on 15 benchmark imbalanced datasets, two multi-label datasets and one large-scale dataset in terms of G-mean, F-measure, AUC, accuracy, TPR and TNR show that BDO exhibits better performance, which is competitive with some commonly considered methods.

AB This paper presents Volumetric Transformer Pose Estimator (VTP), the first 3D volumetric transformer framework for multi-view multi-person 3D human pose estimation. VTP aggregates features from 2D keypoints in all camera views and directly learns the spatial relationships in the 3D voxel space in an end-to-end fashion. The aggregated 3D features are passed through 3D convolutions before being flattened into sequential embeddings and fed into a transformer. A residual structure is designed to further improve the performance. In addition, the sparse Sinkhorn attention is empowered to reduce the memory cost, which is a major bottleneck for volumetric representations, while also achieving excellent performance. The output of the transformer is again concatenated with 3D convolutional features by a residual design. The proposed VTP framework integrates the high performance of the transformer with volumetric representations, which can be used as a good alternative to the convolutional backbones. Experiments on the Shelf, Campus and CMU Panoptic benchmarks show promising results in terms of both Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and Percentage of Correctly estimated Parts (PCP). Our code will be available.

TI Dual-stream GNN fusion network for hyperspectral classification

DT Article; Early Access
DE HSI classifcation; GNN; Dynamic GCN; Graph pooling
AB Semi-supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as an effective data representation learning framework, have been applied to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Although GNNs can quickly capture the structural information of HSIs, traditional GNN-based methods use the entire graph as input, which consumes huge computational resources. Moreover, using a single form of GNN variant cannot effectively extract the correlation between two different dimensions, leading to insufficient improvement in the impact of noise and spectral differences in HSIs. To address these issues, a Dual-Stream GNN Fusion Network (named DGFNet) is proposed in this paper. This end-to-end network uses subcubes as input to reduce computational costs. The spatial branch uses Graph Attention Network (GAT) to capture the inherent relationships within the HSIs, and the risk of overfitting is reduced by combining a novel graph pooling and local guidance module to preserve important features in subcubes. The spectral branch weights the correlations among bands to obtain more reasonable spectral features. Finally, these spatial, spectral, and structural features are fused and classified using linear layers. Extensive comparative experiments on four benchmark datasets have demonstrated that our model achieves competitive performance, and its low computational cost advantage makes it more feasible and practical compared to most GNN-based methods.

AB A major current focus in software quality is how to identify and interpret Self-admitted technical debt(SATD). While many methods have been proposed to identify SATD, these methods are neither interpretable nor generic. There remains a need for an efficient method that can interpret SATD. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach to identify and interpret SATD using interpretable methods. In the first stage, the decision tree model is combined into an integrated model to identify SATD better. We apply SHAP, LIME, and Anchors models in the second stage to interpret the result. The experiments of 10 projects show that our method not only can effectively detect and explain SATD both in within-project and cross-project experiments, but also has a good explanation for self-generated data outside the dataset.

ID RECOGNITION
AB The speaker encoder is an important front-end module that explores discriminative speaker features for many speech applications requiring speaker information. Current speaker encoders aggregate multi-scale features from utterances using multi-branch network architectures. However, naively adding many branches through a fully convolutional operation cannot efficiently improve its capability to capture multi-scale features due to the problem of rapid increase of model parameters and computational complexity. Therefore, in current network architectures, only a few branches corresponding to a limited number of temporal scales are designed for capturing speaker features. To address this problem, this paper proposes an effective temporal multi-scale (TMS) model where multi-scale branches could be efficiently designed in a speaker encoder while negligibly increasing computational costs. The TMS model is based on a time-delay neural network (TDNN), where the network architecture is separated into channel-modeling and temporal multi-branch modeling operators. In the TMS model, adding temporal multi-scale elements in the temporal multi-branch operator only slightly increases the model's parameters, thus saving more of the computational budget to add branches with large temporal scales. After model training, we further develop a systemic re-parameterization method to convert the multi-branch network topology into a single-path-based topology to increase the inference speed.We conducted automatic speaker verification (ASV) experiments under in-domain (VoxCeleb) and out-of-domain (CNCeleb) conditions to investigate the proposed TMS model's performance.Experimental results show that the TMS-method-based model outperformed state-of-the-art ASV models (e.g., ECAPA-TDNN) and improved robustness. Moreover, the proposed model achieved a 29%-46% increase in the inference speed compared to ECAPA-TDNN.

AB Link prediction for knowledge graphs (KGs), which aims to predict missing facts, has been broadly studied in binary relational KGs. However, real world data contains a large number of high-order interaction patterns, which is difficult to describe using only binary relations. In this work, we propose a relation-based dynamic learning model RD-MPNN, based on the message passing neural network model, to learn higher-order interactions and address the link prediction problem in knowledge hypergraphs. Different from existing methods, we consider the positional information of entities within a hyper-relation to differentiate each entity's role in the hyper-relation. Furthermore, we complete the representation learning of hyper-relations by dynamically updating hyper-relations with entity information. Extensive evaluations on two representative knowledge hypergraph datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. We also compare the performance of models at differing arities (the number of entities within a relation), to show that RD-MPNN demonstrates outstanding performance metrics for complex hypergraphs (arity>2).

ID AUTOENCODER
AB Process monitoring of industrial production has always been one of the main concerns of process industry systems. As artificial intelligence booms, fault detection and diagnosis via deep learning has been widely used in industrial process monitoring, such as chemical process monitoring flow. Whereas, the current deep framework is difficult to simultaneously reconcile the relationship between different variables and time series caused by the increasing complexity of industrial systems, which reduces the accuracy of fault detection and diagnosis. Considering the significant time series processing potential of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, this paper proposes a novel two-view LSTM variational auto-encoder, aliased as TVAE. First, the running data in period T is obtained through sliding window, then it utilizes two-view embedding to compress time series information and capture the correlation between time variables, after that it is judged whether it is fault data according to the anomaly score of the variational auto-encoder. Finally, since the encoding process makes the time-dependent and variable dependent features more obvious, the fault characteristic of the encoded data can be obtained by neuron grouping convolution, and then classified for diagnosis. Experimental results on Tennessee Eastman process benchmark show that TVAE is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and provides a new paradigm for industrial process fault detection and diagnosis.

DT Article
DE Efficient; lightweight; Mirai; malware detection
AB The Mirai botnet, notorious for launching significant Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and crippling portions of internet services in late 2016, has emerged as a significant threat. Its threat is magnified by the open-source nature of the original Mirai code, which enables a propagation and evolution rate that surpasses traditional malware and frequently defies common sense.As the primary targets of Mirai attacks, Internet of Things (IoT) devices must promptly adapt to the evolving variations of the Mirai threat scenario. In practice, however, IoT devices are frequently constrained by insufficient security detection resources. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a lightweight framework capable of handling Mirai variants and dynamically updating its rule set in order to effectively counter the threat.In response to these challenges, we present Efficient and lightweight Mirai Variants Detection (EVaDe), a novel, lightweight framework for detecting Mirai. EVaDe unleashes the power of sample function mining to efficiently automate the generation of detection rules, requiring limited hardware resources while maintaining effectiveness against Mirai and its numerous variants. In addition, to improve the efficacy of rule generation, we propose a sophisticated algorithm designed to optimize the maximum submatrix problem, thereby facilitating the efficient and rapid extraction of malicious rules from the sample group.We validated the experiments on actual IoT devices with significantly compressed performance overheads. An average sample detection time of 5 ms to make sure the system can be deployed in real production. According to the result, the approach has an average detection rate of 95% for Mirai and its variants, which beats every other well-known piece of commercial antivirus software on the market by 3% to 56%.

AB Laser directed energy deposition (LDED), a class of additive manufacturing (AM) processes, has immense potential to be used for various engineering applications to build components with medium to high complexity. However, dimensional deviations from intended values and inadequate surface quality of the built parts limit its wide deployment. The present work reports the development of an adaptive tool path trajectory platform to correct the dimensional inaccuracies in-situ to build high-quality components using LDED. The study deploys a laser line scanner to scan the part after the deposition of the definite number of layers followed by the detection of concave, convex, and flat surfaces using deep learning. Further, a novel adaptive trajectory planning algorithm is deployed by using three different strategies to control material deposition on concave, convex, and flat surfaces. The material deposition is controlled by using adaptive scanning speed control (ASSC), and a combination of laser on-off and scanning speed control (ASSLC). Subsequently, the built geometries are subjected to geometric, microstructure, and mechanical characterizations. It is observed that the deviation of the part was reduced by 30%, and 27.5% using ASSC and ASSLC, respectively. The structures built using the three strategies show some micropores at isolated locations. The microstructure is mainly cellular under all conditions with a similar average microhardness of similar to 210 HV. The study provides an integrated and comprehensive approach for building high-quality large-scale components using LDED with minimal dimensional deviation from the original CAD model.

ID SPARSE REPRESENTATION; NOISE REMOVAL
AB During the last decades, learning-based deep neural network (DNN) has shown its advantages on hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. Compared to classical prior-based methods, DNN-based algorithms employ a larger scale of training samples for learning to simulate the complex image generation process with higher accuracy. However, most DNN-based HSI denoising methods are designed by a superposition convolution layer, which cannot fully use the frequency information in the image itself, especially the information containing a strong response to noise in high-frequency domain. Thus, we propose a high-frequency attention network (HFAN) assisted by both spectral and spatial high-frequency information to achieve accurate HSIs denoising in this paper. Our proposed HFAN comprises a high-frequency and denoising branch, and the auxiliary function of high-frequency information is realized by transmitting the characteristic information of the high-frequency component to the denoising branch. Specifically, the spatial-spectral attention (SSA) module is presented to recover more detail in space and spectra. Experiments on synthetic and real HSI data show that our proposed HFAN achieves better denoising results compare to the other advanced methods.

DE Depth images; Indoor semantic segmentation; Three-stream; Coordinate
   attention
AB Semantic segmentation plays a vital role in indoor scene analysis. Currently, its accuracy is still limited due to the complex conditions of various indoor scenes. In addition, it is difficult to complete this task solely relying on RGB images. Since depth images can provide additional 3D geometric information to RGB images, researchers chose to incorporate depth images for improving the accuracy of indoor semantic segmentation. However, it is still a challenge to effectively fuse the depth information with the RGB images. To address this issue, a three-stream coordinate attention network is proposed. The presented network reconstructs a multi-modal feature fusion module for RGB-D features, which can realize the aggregation of two modal information along the spatial and channel dimensions. Meanwhile, three convolutional neural network branches are used to construct a parallel three-stream structure, which can, respectively, process the RGB features, depth features and combined features. On one hand, the proposed network can preserve the original RGB and depth feature streams, simultaneously. On the other hand, it can also contribute to utilize and propagate the fusion feature flow better. The embedded ASPP module is used to optimize the semantic information in the proposed network, so as to aggregate the feature information of different scales and obtain more accurate features. Experimental results show that the proposed model can reach a state-of-the-art mIoU accuracy of 50.2% on the NYUDv2 dataset and on the more complex SUN-RGBD dataset.

AB Artificial intelligence is making extraordinary progress with an unprecedented rate, reaching and surpassing human capabilities in many tasks previously considered unattainable by machines, as language translation, music composition, object detection, medical diagnoses, software programming, and many others. Some people are excited about these results, while others are raising serious concerns for possible negative impacts in our society. This article addresses several questions that are often raised about intelligent machines: Will machines ever surpass human intellectual capacities? What will happen next? What will be the impact in our society? What are the jobs that artificial intelligence puts at risk? Reasoning about these questions is of fundamental importance to predict possible future scenarios and prepare ourselves to face the consequences.

AB Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in human-computer interaction, which can provide better interactivity to enhance user experiences. Existing approaches tend to directly apply deep learning networks to distinguish emotions. Among them, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is the most commonly used method to learn emotional representations from spectrograms. However, CNN does not explicitly model features' associations in the spectral-, temporal-, and channel-wise axes or their relative relevance, which will limit the representation learning. In this article, we propose a deep spectro-temporal-channel network (DSTCNet) to improve the representational ability for speech emotion. The proposed DSTCNet integrates several spectro-temporal-channel (STC) attention modules into a general CNN. Specifically, we propose the STC module that infers a 3-D attention map along the dimensions of time, frequency, and channel. The STC attention can focus more on the regions of crucial time frames, frequency ranges, and feature channels. Finally, experiments were conducted on the Berlin emotional database (EmoDB) and interactive emotional dyadic motion capture (IEMOCAP) databases. The results reveal that our DSTCNet can outperform the traditional CNN-based and several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Anomaly detection is a fundamental task in hyperspectral image (HSI) processing. However, most existing methods rely on pixel feature vectors and overlook the relational structure information between pixels, limiting the detection performance. In this article, we propose a novel approach to hyperspectral anomaly detection that characterizes the HSI data using a vertex-and edge-weighted graph with the pixels as vertices. The constructed graph encodes rich structural information in an affinity matrix. A crucial innovation of our method is the ability to obtain internal relations between pixels at multiple topological scales by processing different powers of the affinity matrix. This power processing is viewed as a graph evolution, which enables anomaly detection using vertex extraction formulated as a quadratic programming problem on graphs of varying topological scales. We also design a hierarchical guided filtering architecture to fuse multiscale detection results derived from graph evolution, which significantly reduces the false alarm rate. Our approach effectively characterizes the topological properties of HSIs, leveraging the structural information between pixels to improve anomaly detection accuracy. Experimental results on four real HSIs demonstrate the superior detection performance of our proposed approach compared to some state-of-the-art hyperspectral anomaly detection methods.

AB In person re-identification (re-ID), extracting part-level features from person images has been verified to be crucial to offer fine-grained information. Most of the existing CNN-based methods only locate the human parts coarsely, or rely on pretrained human parsing models and fail in locating the identifiable nonhuman parts (e.g., knapsack). In this article, we introduce an alignment scheme in transformer architecture for the first time and propose the auto-aligned transformer (AAformer) to automatically locate both the human parts and nonhuman ones at patch level. We introduce the "Part tokens (PARTs)", which are learnable vectors, to extract part features in the transformer. A PART only interacts with a local subset of patches in self-attention and learns to be the part representation. To adaptively group the image patches into different subsets, we design the auto-alignment. Auto-alignment employs a fast variant of optimal transport (OT) algorithm to online cluster the patch embeddings into several groups with the PARTs as their prototypes. AAformer integrates the part alignment into the self-attention and the output PARTs can be directly used as part features for retrieval. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PARTs and the superiority of AAformer over various state-of-the-art methods.

AB Video captioning generation has become one of the research hotspots in recent years due to its wide range of potential application scenarios. It captures the situation where recognition errors occur in the description due to insufficient interaction between visual features and text features during model encoding, and the attention mechanism is difficult to explicitly model the visual and verbal coherence. In this paper, we propose a video captioning algorithm CAVF (Cascaded Attention-guided Visual Features Fusion for Video Captioning) based on cascaded attention-guided visual features fusion. In the encoding stage, a cascaded attention mechanism is proposed to model the visual content correlation between different frames, and the global semantic information can better guide the visual features fusion, through which the network further enhances the correlation between the visual features of the model and the decoder. In the decoding stage, the overall features and word vectors obtained from the multilayer long- and short-term memory network are encoded for de-enhancement to generate the current words. Experiments on the public datasets MSVD and MSR-VTT validate the effectiveness of the model in this paper, and the proposed method in this paper improves 5.6%, 1.3%, and 4.3% in BLEU_4, ROUGE, and CIDER metrics, respectively, on the MSR-VTT public dataset compared with the benchmark method.

AB Accurate segmentation of human tissue structure from medical images is one of the critical links in medical image diagnosis. However, due to the medical image scale of different tissues varying significantly and being structurally complex, the low contrast between tissues and background in some medical imaging makes it challenging to identify. The existing models are difficult to extract representative multi-scale features of medical images that cannot accurately segment the organizational structure from the background in low-contrast medical images. To solve these problems, this study presents a scale and context information fusion network structure based on multi-type medical image segmentation (SCIF-Net), which contains three modules: feature pyramid encoder (FPE), multi-scale feature dynamic aggregation (MFDA), and adaptive spatial information fusion (ASIF). We build the FPE module to further enhance the representational ability of the network encoder output feature map at each stage. The MFDA module is used to effectively extract multi-scale information from the encoder output feature map and aggregate multi-scale features. The constructed ASIF module enables the network to selectively concentrate on the vital spatial information in the encoder feature map and merge the decoder feature map semantic information, minimizing background noise influence. Extensive experiments on the retinal segmentation task, gland segmentation task, and femur segmentation task, show that the SCIF-Net network outperforms other advanced methods.

ID RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AB Collaborative filtering (CF) approaches generate user recommendations based on user similarities. These similarities are calculated based on the overall (explicit) user ratings. However, in some domains, such ratings may be sparse or unavailable. User reviews can play a significant role in such cases, as implicit ratings can be derived from the reviews using sentiment analysis, a natural language processing technique. However, most current studies calculate the implicit ratings by simply aggregating the scores of all sentiment words appearing in reviews and, thus, ignoring the elements of sentiment degrees and aspects of user reviews. This study addresses this issue by calculating the implicit rating differently, leveraging the rich information in user reviews by using both sentiment words and aspect-sentiment word pairs to enhance the CF performance. It proposes four methods to calculate the implicit ratings on large-scale datasets: the first considers the degree of sentiment words, while the second exploits the aspects by extracting aspect-sentiment word pairs to calculate the implicit ratings. The remaining two methods combine explicit ratings with the implicit ratings generated by the first two methods. The generated ratings are then incorporated into different CF rating prediction algorithms to evaluate their effectiveness in enhancing the CF performance. Evaluative experiments of the proposed methods are conducted on two large-scale datasets: Amazon and Yelp. Results of the experiments show that the proposed ratings improved the accuracy of CF rating prediction algorithms and outperformed the explicit ratings in terms of three predictive accuracy metrics.

AB Ecological biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate. To combat such irreversible changes in natural ecosystems, biodiversity conservation initiatives are being conducted globally. However, the lack of a feasible methodology to quantify biodiversity in real-time and investigate population dynamics in spatiotemporal scales prevents the use of ecological data in environmental planning. Traditionally, ecological studies rely on the census of an animal population by the "capture, mark and recapture"technique. In this technique, human field workers manually count, tag and observe tagged individuals, making it time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome to patrol the entire area. Recent research has also demonstrated the potential for inexpensive and accessible sensors for ecological data monitoring. However, stationary sensors collect localised data which is highly specific on the placement of the setup. In this research, we propose the methodology for biodiversity monitoring utilising state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) methods operating in real-time on sample payloads of mobile robots. Such trained DL algorithms demonstrate a mean average precision (mAP) of 90.51% in an average inference time of 67.62 milliseconds within 6,000 training epochs. We claim that the use of such mobile platform setups inferring real-time ecological data can help us achieve our goal of quick and effective biodiversity surveys. An experimental test payload is fabricated, and online as well as offline field surveys are conducted, validating the proposed methodology for species identification that can be further extended to geo-localisation of flora and fauna in any ecosystem.

AB Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) play a crucial role in healthcare decision-making by giving physicians insights into disease progression and suitable treatment options. Within EHRs, laboratory test results are frequently utilized for predicting disease progression. However, processing laboratory test results often poses challenges due to variations in units and formats. In addition, leveraging the temporal information in EHRs can improve outcomes, prognoses, and diagnosis predication. Nevertheless, the irregular frequency of the data in these records necessitates data preprocessing, which can add complexity to time-series analyses.Methods: To address these challenges, we developed an open-source R package that facilitates the extraction of temporal information from laboratory records. The proposed lab package generates analysis-ready time series data by segmenting the data into time-series windows and imputing missing values. Moreover, users can map local laboratory codes to the Logical Observation Identifier Names and Codes (LOINC), an international standard. This mapping allows users to incorporate additional information, such as reference ranges and related diseases. Moreover, the reference ranges provided by LOINC enable us to categorize results into normal or abnormal. Finally, the analysis-ready time series data can be further summarized using descriptive statistics and utilized to develop models using machine learning technologies.Results: Using the lab package, we analyzed data from MIMIC-III, focusing on newborns with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). We extracted time-series laboratory records and compared the differences in test results between patients with and without 30-day in-hospital mortality. We then identified significant variations in several laboratory test results 7 days after PDA diagnosis. Leveraging the time series- analysis-ready data, we trained a prediction model with the long short-term memory algorithm, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 for predicting 30-day in-hospital mortality in model training. These findings demonstrate the lab package's effectiveness in analyzing disease progression.Conclusions: The proposed lab package simplifies and expedites the workflow involved in laboratory records extraction. This tool is particularly valuable in assisting clinical data analysts in overcoming the obstacles associated with heterogeneous and sparse laboratory records.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing public discourse regarding the influence AI will have on the future of work. Simultaneously, considerable critical attention has been given to the implications of AI on gender equality. Far from making precise predictions about the future, this discourse demonstrates that new technologies are instances for renegotiating the relation of gender and work. This paper examines how gender is addressed in news media discourse on AI and the future of work, focusing on Germany. We approach this question from a perspective of feminist technology studies and discourse analysis, exploring a corpus of 178 articles from 2015 to 2021 from German newspapers and newsmagazines. The findings indicate that critical AI and gender knowledge circulates in public discourse in the form of specific discursive frames, thematizing algorithmic bias, automatization and enhancement, and gender stereotypes. As a result, we show that, first, the discourse takes up feminist and scholarly discourse on gender and discusses AI in a way that is informed by social constructivism and standpoint theories. Second, gender appears as a-to some extent intersectional-diversity category which is critical to AI, while at the same time omitting important perspectives. Third, it can be shown that there is a renegotiating of the ideal worker norm taking place, and finally, we argue that the gendered frame of the powerful men developer responsible for AI's risk is a concept to be challenged.

AB The detection of unfavorable driving states (UDS) of drivers based on electroencephalogram (EEG) measures has received continuous attention from extensive scholars on account of directly reflecting brain neural activity with high temporal resolution and low risk of being deceived. However, the existing EEG-based driver UDS detection methods involve limited exploration of the functional connectivity patterns and interaction relationships within the brain network. Therefore, there is still room for improvement in the accuracy of detection. In this project, we propose three pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN)-based automatic detection frameworks for UDS of drivers with 30-channel EEG signals. The frameworks are investigated by adjusting the learning rate and choosing the optimization solver, etc. Two different conditions of driving experiments are performed, collecting EEG signals from sixteen subjects. The acquired 1-dimensional 30-channel EEG signals are converted into 2-dimensional matrices by the Granger causality (GC) method to form the functional connectivity graphs of the brain (FCGB). Then, the FCGB are fed into pretrained deep learning models that employed transfer learning strategy for feature extraction and judgment of different EEG signal types. Furthermore, we adopt two visualization interpretability techniques, named, activation visualization and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) for better visualizing and understanding the predictions of the pretrained models after fine-tuning. The experimental outcomes show that Resnet 18 model yields the highest average recognition accuracy of 90% using the rmsprop optimizer with a learning rate of 1e - 3. The overall outcomes suggest that cooperating of biologically inspired functional connectivity graphs of the brain and pretrained transfer learning algorithms is a prospective approach in reducing the rate of major traffic accidents caused by driver unfavorable driving states.

AB Script identification plays a vital role in applications that involve handwriting and document analysis within a multi-script and multi-lingual environment. Moreover, it exhibits a profound connection with human cognition. This paper provides a new database for benchmarking script identification algorithms, which contains both printed and handwritten documents collected from a wide variety of scripts, such as Arabic, Bengali (Bangla), Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Devanagari, Japanese, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Roman, Tamil, Telugu, and Thai. The dataset consists of 1,135 documents scanned from local newspaper and handwritten letters as well as notes from different native writers. Further, these documents are segmented into lines and words, comprising a total of 13,979 and 86,655 lines and words, respectively, in the dataset. Easy-to-go benchmarks are proposed with handcrafted and deep learning methods. The benchmark includes results at the document, line, and word levels with printed and handwritten documents. Results of script identification independent of the document/line/word level and independent of the printed/handwritten letters are also given. The new multi-lingual database is expected to create new script identifiers, present various challenges, including identifying handwritten and printed samples and serve as a foundation for future research in script identification based on the reported results of the three benchmarks.

AB The article considers the problem of motion coordination for a multiagent (MA) network whose goal is to track a large-scale multitarget (MT) system in a region populated by dynamic obstacles. We first characterize a density path which corresponds to the expected evolution of the macroscopic state of the MT system, which is represented by the probability density function (PDF) of a time-varying Gaussian mixture (GM). We compute this density path by using an adaptive optimal control method which accounts for the distribution of the (possibly moving) obstacles over the environment described by a time-varying obstacle map function. We show that each target of the MT system can find microscopic inputs that can collectively realize the density path while guaranteeing obstacle avoidance at all times. Subsequently, we propose a Voronoi distributed motion coordination algorithm which determines the individual microscopic control inputs of each agent of the MA network so that the latter can track the MT system while avoiding collisions with obstacles and their teammates. The proposed algorithm relies on a distributed move-to-centroid control law in which the density over the Voronoi cell of each agent is determined by the estimated macroscopic state evolution of the MT system. Finally, simulation results are presented to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Nowadays, the level of invoice traffic between companies has reached enormous levels. Invoices are crucial financial documents for companies, and they need to extract this information from these documents to access and control them quickly when necessary. While electronic invoices can be easily transferred to the company's ERP system with the help of integrators, information from printed invoices must be entered into the ERP system. Information entry is generally performed manually by company employees, so the probability of error is high. The automatic recognition of information in printed invoices will reduce the possibility of error. It will also save time and money by reducing workforce requirements. This study proposes a deep learning-based solution for detecting fields in image invoices that are in high demand among businesses. The system offers an end-to-end solution, which includes a novel method for generating synthetic invoices and automatic labeling. Three invoice templates were used to evaluate the usability of the system and an adaptive fine-tuning-based solution is proposed for newly coming invoice templates. Furthermore, 6 different object detection models were compared to find the most suitable one for our problem. The system was also tested with 1022 real invoice images that were manually labeled to test real-world usage. The results indicated that the fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy that was 8.4% higher than the baseline models. In tests performed on CPU, TOOD and Cascade-RCNN models were the most successful algorithms, while YOLOv5 was the fastest running algorithm. Depending on the priority of the needs, both algorithms can be preferred for real-time usage in the detection of invoice fields. The synthetic invoice generation code is available at https://github.com/SCU-CENG/Invoice-Generation.

We first characterize the geometric properties of the synchronization error between two replicas of a 1D elementary cellular automata following Wolfram's rule 18. We propose a simple approach to statistically model the transient phase of the spreading of the synchronization error. We finally present a way to utilize our model of the error spreading to place mobile sensors in order to improve the overall replica synchronization in the case in which the initial error is small.

AB The goal of this paper it to explore the possibility to simplify a stochastic complex dynamical system by reducing the number of its degrees of freedom, through a coarse graining procedure. Our objective is to create reduced systems which requires less computational burden to control. In other words, the question is whether one can act on the simplified system to control its evolution towards a given target, so that the same strategy also applies to the full system. We analyze this problem in three stages. First we consider the general case of coarse-graining 1D cellular automata. We show that the procedure is expected to produce extra stochasticity in the system, while still retaining some characteristics of the original system. In a second step, we study a 1D voter model for which the coarse-graining procedure requires component weighting, with weights based on causal paths. Finally, in a third part, we consider the same voter model on a scale-free graph, and perform a reduction according to a partition of the graph in communities. The equivalence between the reduced and full systems, whether controlled or not, is investigated through a delayed mutual information analysis, a concept from information theory.

AB The objective of this study was to propose an analytic framework for heat vulnerability based on the detailed spatial unit of a city. Data were analyzed for Daegu city, South Korea, during the period from June 1, 2018, to October 30, 2018. Four types of physical and environmental indicators were used: building density (BD), urbanization density (UD), green density (GD), and park density (PD). By synthesizing these indicators with the principal component analysis (PCA) technique, we created a comprehensive urbanization rate (CUR) index that contributes to the relative comparison of the degree of urbanization between different regions. To verify the generated index, the distribution of the CUR index was compared with heat, and a positive correlation was confirmed. Finally, a heat prediction model was proposed that included the CUR index as the input variable. To resolve the limitation of spatial autocorrelation in traditional linear regression, a deep learning algorithm was introduced. The final model had a root-mean-squared error (RMSE) value of 0.296. In the future, it is expected that the proposed CUR index and the developed heat prediction model can be utilized as an analytic framework for heat vulnerability within a city.

AB To distinguish pathological voices from healthy voices, automatic voice pathology detection systems can be built using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. To fully exploit such systems, large quantities of training data are typically required. The amount of training data is, however, small in the area of pathological voice, and therefore data augmentation (DA) becomes a potential technology to artificially increase the quantity of training data. This study presents a systematic comparison between various DA methods in the detection of pathological voice, including three time domain methods (noise addition, pitch shifting and time stretching), one time-frequency domain method (SpecAugment), and two vocoder-based methods (harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) modification and glottal pulse length modification). Detection systems were built using four popular spectral feature representations (static melfrequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), dynamic MFCCs, spectrogram and melspectrogram). As classifiers, two widely used ML models (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and two DL models (long short-term memory (LSTM) network and convolutional neural network (CNN) with 1-dimensional (1-D) and 2-dimensional (2-D) architectures) were used. These systems were trained using a small number of training samples from two popular databases of pathological voice (HUPA and SVD) to find the best feature/classifier combination for each database. As a result, one ML-based detection system (mel-spectrogram/SVM for HUPA and SVD) and two DL-based detection systems (dynamic MFCCs/2-D CNN for HUPA and melspectrogram/2-D CNN for SVD) were selected for the comparison of the DA methods. The results show that by using DA in the system training, detection accuracy increased compared to the baseline systems that were trained without using DA. This improvement in accuracy was, however, clearly larger for the 2D-CNN system than for the SVM system. Furthermore, all six DA methods improved accuracy of the 2-D CNN system compared to the baseline system for both databases. The highest improvements were achieved using the time-frequency domain SpecAugment DA method, which improved accuracy by 1.5% and 3.8% (absolute) for the HUPA and SVD database, respectively.

AB This paper presents a novel framework that enables the generation of unbiased estimates for test loss using fewer labeled samples, effectively evaluating the predictive performance of classification models in data limited applications. The framework's key innovation lies in developing an adaptive sampling distribution that iteratively identifies influential testing samples based on interactions between learner and evaluator agents. Notably, the adaptive distribution dynamically adjusts the evaluator agent's supervisory role by prioritizing inputs with discrepancies between the agents and considering the evaluator's uncertainty. Comprehensive experimental analyses on synthetic data and two sparse data sets from material extrusion additive manufacturing problems validate the framework's superiority over uniform and fixed sampling distributions. First, the proposed framework provides unbiased estimates of the test loss across various data sets, sampling ratios, and evaluator models. Second, the introduced adaptive sampling distribution significantly reduces the standard deviation of the test loss estimator compared to uniform sampling, achieving a 50% reduction for a 10% sampling ratio in the filament selection benchmark. Third, the framework demonstrates its efficacy in model selection to determine the optimal number of hidden units with a reduced number of test samples. Overall, this work offers a promising framework for evaluating classification models in applications where acquiring labeled data is time-consuming and resource-intensive, including materials science and engineering.

AB The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome type-2 virus (SARSCoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since its emergence to the present day, this disease has brought multiple countries to the brink of health care collapse during several waves of the disease. One of the most common tests performed on patients is chest x-ray imaging. These images show the severity of the patient's illness and whether it is indeed covid or another type of pneumonia. Automated assessment of this type of imaging could alleviate the time required for physicians to treat and diagnose each patient. To this end, in this paper we propose the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to carry out this process. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we present a pipeline adapted to this problem, covering all steps from the preprocessing of the datasets to the generation of classification models based on CNNs. Secondly, we have focused our study on the modification of the information fusion processes of this type of architectures, in the pooling layers. We propose a number of aggregation theory functions that are suitable to replace classical processes and have shown their benefits in past applications, and study their performance in the context of the x-ray classification problem. We find that replacing the feature reduction processes of CNNs leads to drastically different behaviours of the final model, which can be beneficial when prioritizing certain metrics such as precision or recall.

AB Upper limb amputation is a widespread problem worldwide, leading to massive loss of functionality for the victims. While a few solutions exist, these are often very expensive and involve expensive and dangerous surgical procedures. In this paper, we propose a low-cost, highly functional upper limb prosthesis controlled via Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals captured in real-time, classified into upper limb motion intention using a novel Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimized Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to rehabilitate amputees. The proposed 3D-printed prosthetic arm has 3 Degrees-of-Freedom (DOF), which allows it to perform complex movements that can accurately emulate an actual human arm. The results discussed later in this paper conclude that our approach, while being low-cost, is highly accurate and functional.

AB Person search has recently been a challenging task in the computer vision domain, which aims to search specific pedestrians from real cameras.Nevertheless, most surveillance videos comprise only a handful of images of each pedestrian, which often feature identical backgrounds and clothing. Hence, it is difficult to learn more discriminative features for person search in real scenes. To tackle this challenge, we draw on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to synthesize data from surveillance videos. GAN has thrived in computer vision problems because it produces high-quality images efficiently. We merely alter the popular Fast R-CNN model, which is capable of processing videos and yielding accurate detection outcomes. In order to appropriately relieve the pressure brought by the two-stage model, we design an Assisted-Identity Query Module (AIDQ) to provide positive images for the behind part. Besides, the proposed novel GAN-based Scene Synthesis model that can synthesize high-quality cross-id person images for person search tasks. In order to facilitate the feature learning of the GAN-based Scene Synthesis model, we adopt an online learning strategy that collaboratively learns the synthesized images and original images. Extensive experiments on two widely used person search benchmarks, CUHK-SYSU and PRW, have shown that our method has achieved great performance, and the extensive ablation study further justifies our GAN-synthetic data can effectively increase the variability of the datasets and be more

AB Recommender systems analyze user preferences and predict their preferred products based on available data, saving users time in the search for preferred products. However, accurate recommendations for both the system and the user may require complicated computations or the need to store more neighbors, leading to a less scalable algorithm. To address this issue, we define user activity coefficients and then analyze the relationship between different activity coefficients and similarity to design a novel approach for measuring user activity -based similarity in recommender systems. By examining the similarity of inactive user groups, our approach considers the accurate calculation of their similarity as one of the keys to influencing the number of required neighbors for optimal performance. As compared to several advanced collaborative filtering algorithms on two datasets, the algorithm developed in this paper can reduce the number of neighbors by 35.58%-75.38% while maintaining high prediction accuracy. The results indicate that user activity in recommender systems has a significant impact on similarity evaluation, which should be considered in relevant models.

   reconstruction; Partition enhancement
AB Skeleton-based action recognition is an important task in computer vision. Recently, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been successfully applied to this task and achieved remarkable results. However, there are still some non-negligible limitations with existing GCN-based methods. First, the artificial predefined skeleton partition lacks the joint modeling for different types of edges. Second, most GCN models use interleaved deployment of spatial-only and temporal-only modules to achieve feature learning, which makes them ineffective in capturing spatiotemporal co-occurrence from action sequences. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel feature reconstruction graph convolutional network (FR-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposed FR-GC combines coarse-grained temporal and spatial features to reconstruct finegrained spatiotemporal features, realizing simultaneous learning of temporal and spatial representations in a single module and significantly improving the capability of the model for spatiotemporal feature extraction. We also propose a topology partition enhancement module to achieve adaptive complementation among different types of edges. Moreover, an efficient multi-scale dual-domain temporal convolution is used to complete further temporal modeling. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed FR-GCN achieves competitive results on both NTU RGB+D 60 dataset and NTU RGB+D 120 dataset. Especially under the cross-subject benchmarks of the two datasets, the proposed FR-GCN achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

AB Recently, sampling-based algorithms have demonstrated advantages in complex and high-dimensional environments. The RRT* algorithm, as the best variant of RRT, provides progressive optimality. It is shown that the RRT* algorithm has a slow convergence speed and a high initial path cost that result in the low efficiency of the algorithm, due to the low probability of adequate sampling caused by the invalid expansion of the tree and redundant sampling. To overcome these limitations, the SOF-RRT* algorithm is proposed to generate better initial solutions with higher stability and faster convergence. The SOF-RRT* algorithm is an improvement on the F-RRT* algorithm. The SOF-RRT* algorithm introduces a spatial probability weight sampling strategy into sampling, which makes the sampling probability higher in the area with a large feasible area. It reduces redundant sampling and increases the effective sampling rate. In the aspect of tree expansion, the strategy of target bias and obstacle tangential bias is introduced to improve the tree expansion efficiency, which makes tree expansion away from obstacles and bias to the target point. The proposed algorithm improves the expansion efficiency of sampling and tree. Finally, the initial path generation and convergence speed are simulated and compared, which proves that the algorithm has been greatly optimized in terms of the number of iterations, path quality, and convergence speed.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Surrogate algorithms such as Bayesian optimisation are especially designed for black-box optimisation problems with expensive objectives, such as hyperparameter tuning or simulation-based optimisation. In the literature, these algorithms are usually evaluated with synthetic benchmarks which are well established but have no expensive objective, and only on one or two real-life applications which vary wildly between papers. There is a clear lack of standardisation when it comes to benchmarking surrogate algorithms on real-life, expensive, black-box objective functions. This makes it very difficult to draw conclusions on the effect of algorithmic contributions and to give substantial advice on which method to use when. A new benchmark library, EXPObench, provides first steps towards such a standardisation. The library is used to provide an extensive comparison of six different surrogate algorithms on four expensive optimisation problems from different real-life applications. This has led to new insights regarding the relative importance of exploration, the evaluation time of the objective, and the used model. We also provide rules of thumb for which surrogate algorithm to use in which situation. A further contribution is that we make the algorithms and benchmark problem instances publicly available, contributing to more uniform analysis of surrogate algorithms. Most importantly, we include the results of the six algorithms on all evaluated problem instances. This unique new dataset lowers the bar for researching new methods as the number of expensive evaluations required for comparison and for the creation of new surrogate models is significantly reduced.& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB In this paper, a parallel extended state observer (PESO) is proposed by merging a series of different order linear tracking differentiators and first-order nonlinear differentiators. Both measurement noises and system uncertainties are taken into account in design procedures. A distinct feature of the parallel structure is that the observed information of each part is independent of each other, which effectively avoids the accumulation of the observation error of each part. The PESO is utilized to estimate the total disturbance, which reflects the combined impacts of internal uncertainties and external disturbances. Based on the observation results generated by the PESO, a composite controller is developed for output feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems. The convergence performance of the proposed PESO and PESO-based controller is rigorously verified. Finally, some numerical simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

TI GAA-PPO: A novel graph adversarial attack method by incorporating
   proximal policy optimization
SO NEUROCOMPUTING

   Reinforcement learning
AB The Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has demonstrated impressive performance in processing graph structured data. However recent studies have revealed that GCN is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where a small amount of data modification can significantly affect the performance of the GCN models. While most existing studies node injection attacks with graph reinforcement learning by considering gradient information, they still suffer from the problems that the step size of the policy gradient is difficult to determine, and the attack effect needs to be further improved. In light of the above issues, this paper proposes a Graph Adversarial Attack method by incorporating Proximal Policy Optimization named GAA-PPO, which fills subtasks of sequentially generating features and links for injected nodes without modifying existing nodes or edges. GAA-PPO comprises two main components: node injection attack network (actor network) and value prediction network (critic network). Specifically, the actor network leverages a node generator and an edge sampler to generate appropriate features and edges for the injected nodes. Notably, a novel edge sampler that incorporates Approximation Personalized Propagation of Neural Prediction (APPNP) is introduced to effectively propagate malicious features of the injected nodes. On the other hand, the critic network evaluates the performance of the perturbed graph at each stage. To enhance the stability of the algorithm, GAA-PPO employs the importance sampling technique of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) during the training process. Extensive experiments on three publicly benchmark datasets show that GAA-PPO yields significant performance advantages over the state-of-the-art method.

AB Data availability is a major obstacle to the successful application of artificial intelligence. In chemistry, pharmaceutical and materials science, generating labelled data on scale relies on expensive screening approaches that require major human and/or economic investments. Although industry uses sophisticated autonomous systems for such tasks, tight intellectual property concerns and strict confidentiality agreements limit data accessibility, thus restricting innovation and hindering the concept of "open science". Without automation, data collection is laborious and sample characterization often suffers from subjectivity introduced by the operator. This study tackles the challenge of pharmaceutical particle characterization by modifying a 3D printer to enable rapid, autonomous sample characterization using light microscopy. The system uses low-cost hardware and open-source software in a platform that is accessible and reproducible for the scientific community. As well as increasing throughput, this system uses deep learning to assign sample labels in real-time overcoming bias from subjective labelling, which hinders model performance. Different neural architectures were applied, including convolution and attention blocks, to maximize performance and demonstrate the transferability of the system. This autonomous system effectively characterized pharmaceutical crystal morphology, an area where subjective labelling and limited data have hindered applying machine learning models. By releasing this platform, researchers without access to sophisticated automation platforms can carry out larger in-house screening efforts to generate datasets for developing data-driven, intelligent models.

AB The popularity of social networks and video-on-demand platforms has increased the importance of image and video censorship. These platforms contain various content such as violence, explicit content, drug use and smoking that may be offensive or harmful to certain viewers. As a result, censorship is employed to filter or remove content that is unsuitable for particular audiences such as children and teenagers. However, policies for censoring harmful content in digital environments are either limited or nonexistent. This underscores the need for automated systems that can detect and censor harmful content in real time. To address these challenges, we developed the first of our knowledge systems using deep learning techniques to censor harmful content. We propose two novel, YOLO-based real-time censorship algorithms. Our approaches employ a pipeline-based architecture that parallelizes the operations with subprocesses. In our experiments, the proposed algorithms performed faster and with higher accuracies compared to traditional approaches. Specifically, its content-based accuracies were 98% for explicit content, 97% for alcohol, 98% for cigarettes and 97% for violence. Our research highlights the importance of developing effective and efficient solutions for censoring harmful content on digital media platforms. Our deep learning-based system represents a promising approach to this challenge and has the potential to enhance user safety and protect vulnerable groups from harmful and offensive content. Future research will continue to refine and improve such systems to better address the evolving landscape of digital media and the challenges posed by harmful content.

ID IMAGE; FEATURES
AB Resampling is an extremely well-known technique performed for Image forgery detection. It includes the changes in the content of a picture in terms of rotation, stretching/zooming, and shrinking, to frame a forged picture that is a localized forgery in comparison to the original picture. With the wrong intention, resampling forgery has been increased day by day, and its negative impact has been increased in criminology, law enforcement, forensics, research etc. Accordingly, the interest in the algorithm of image resampling forgery detection is significantly developed in image forensics. In this paper, a novel image resampling forgery detection technique has been proposed. In the proposed technique, two types of Markov feature with spatial and Discrete Cosine Transform domains have been extracted to recognize the resampling operation. The spatial domain gives the information for the distribution of the pixels and DCT gives the edge information. Further, these Markov features are consolidated. Due to high dimensionality hard thresholding technique is used for reducing the dimensionality. Then, these Markov features are applied to the set of models of different classifiers. With the utilization of classifiers, weighted majority voting values have been calculated during the ensemble classification. Unlike the other techniques, these weighted voting boundaries have been consequently balanced during the training process until the best accuracy has been obtained. However, it is very difficult to get best accuracy so for getting best accuracy this research needs to do lots of iterations and trained the dataset. For the comparative study very few research has been found for this resampling forgery technique with different interpolation techniques and classifier. Still, comparison has been done with some latest research work. The comparative analysis shows that the proposed ensemble learning-based algorithm provides the best outcomes with the accuracy of 99.12% for bicubic, 98.89% for bilinear, and 98.23% for lanczos3 kernel with considerably less complexity and high speed in comparison to prior techniques which are using single support vector machine for classification. Moreover, the proposed algorithm also detects a very low probability of error of 0.44% and detects the type of interpolation kernel, size of the forgery, and the type of resampling, whether it is up sampling and down sampling, using Graphical User Interface which has not been detected previously with multiple forgery detection.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The identification and segmentation of histological regions of interest can provide significant support to pathologists in their diagnostic tasks. However, segmentation methods are constrained by the difficulty in obtaining pixel-level annotations, which are tedious and expensive to collect for whole-slide images (WSI). Though several methods have been developed to exploit image-level weak-supervision for WSI classification, the task of segmentation using WSI-level labels has received very little attention. The research in this direction typically require additional supervision beyond image labels, which are difficult to obtain in real world practice. In this study, we propose WholeSIGHT, a weakly-supervised method that can simultaneously segment and classify WSIs of arbitrary shapes and sizes. Formally, WholeSIGHT first constructs a tissue-graph representation of WSI, where the nodes and edges depict tissue regions and their interactions, respectively. During training, a graph classification head classifies the WSI and produces node-level pseudo-labels via post-hoc feature attribution. These pseudo-labels are then used to train a node classification head for WSI segmentation. During testing, both heads simultaneously render segmentation and class prediction for an input WSI. We evaluate the performance of WholeSIGHT on three public prostate cancer WSI datasets. Our method achieves state-of-the-art weakly-supervised segmentation performance on all datasets while resulting in better or comparable classification with respect to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised WSI classification methods. Additionally, we assess the generalization capability of our method in terms of segmentation and classification performance, uncertainty estimation, and model calibration.

ID FUSION
AB Summarization is a technique that produces condensed text from large text documents by using different deep-learning techniques. Over the past few years, abstractive summarization has drawn much attention because of the capability of generating human-like sentences with the help of machines. However, it must improve repetition, redundancy and lexical problems while generating sentences. Previous studies show that incorporating images with text modality in the abstractive summary may reduce redundancy, but the concentration still needs to lay on the semantics of the sentences. This paper considers adding a topic to a multimodal summary to address semantics and linguistics problems. This stress the need to develop a multimodal summarization system with the topic. Multimodal summarization uses two or more modalities to extract the essential features to increase user satisfaction in generating an abstractive summary. However, the paper's primary aim is to explore the generation of user preference summaries of a particular topic by proposing a Hybrid Image Text Topic (HITT) to guide the extracted essential information from text and image modalities with the help of topic that addresses semantics and linguistic problems to generate a topic-guided abstractive multimodal summary. Furthermore, a caption-summary order space technique has been introduced in this proposed work to retrieve the relevant image for the generated summary. Finally, the MSMO dataset compares and validates the results with rouge and image precision scores. Besides, we also calculated the model's loss using sparse categorical cross entropy and showed significant improvement over other state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Mixed data containing categorical and numerical attributes are widely available in real-world. Before analysing such data, it is typically necessary to process (transform/embed/represent) them into high-quality numerical data. The conditional probability transformation method (CPT) can provide acceptable performance in the majority of cases, but it is not satisfactory for datasets with strong attribute association. Inspired by the one dependence value difference metric method, the concept of relaxing the attributes conditional independence has been applied to CPT, but this approach has the drawback of dramatically-expanding the attribute dimensionality. We employ the isometric embedding method to tackle the problem of dimensionality expansion. In addition, an attribute weighting method based on the must-link and cannot-link constraints is designed to optimize the data transformation quality. Combining these methods, we propose an attribute-weighted isometric embedding (AWIE) for categorical encoding on mixed data. Extensive experimental results obtained on 16 datasets demonstrate that AWIE significantly improves upon the classification performance (increasing the F1-score by 2.54%, attaining 6/16 best results, and reaching average ranks of 1.94/8), compared with 28 competitors.

ID AFFORDANCE
AB Traditional AI-planning methods for task planning in robotics require a symbolically encoded domain description. While powerful in well-defined scenarios, as well as human-interpretable, setting this up requires a substantial effort. Different from this, most everyday planning tasks are solved by humans intuitively, using mental imagery of the different planning steps. Here, we suggest that the same approach can be used for robots too, in cases which require only limited execution accuracy. In the current study, we propose a novel sub-symbolic method called Simulated Mental Imagery for Planning (SiMIP), which consists of perception, simulated action, success checking, and re-planning performed on 'imagined' images. We show that it is possible to implement mental imagery-based planning in an algorithmically sound way by combining regular convolutional neural networks and generative adversarial networks. With this method, the robot acquires the capability to use the initially existing scene to generate action plans without symbolic domain descriptions, while at the same time, plans remain human-interpretable, different from deep reinforcement learning, which is an alternative sub-symbolic approach. We create a data set from real scenes for a packing problem of having to correctly place different objects into different target slots. This way efficiency and success rate of this algorithm could be quantified.

TI Fair tree classifier using strong demographic parity

DT Article; Early Access
DE Fairness; Criterion; Society; Sensitive
AB When dealing with sensitive data in automated data-driven decision-making, an important concern is to learn predictors with high performance towards a class label, whilst minimising for the discrimination towards any sensitive attribute, like gender or race, induced from biased data. Hybrid tree optimisation criteria have been proposed which combine classification performance and fairness. Although the threshold-free ROC-AUC is the standard for measuring classification model performance, current fair tree classification methods mainly optimise for a fixed threshold on the fairness metric. In this paper, we propose SCAFF-splitting criterion AUC for Fairness-a compound decision tree splitting criterion which combines the threshold-free strong demographic parity with ROC-AUC termed, easily applicable as an ensemble. Our method simultaneously leverages multiple sensitive attributes of which the values may be multicategorical, and is tunable with respect to the unavoidable performance-fairness trade-off. In our experiments, we demonstrate how SCAFF generates effective models with competitive performance and fairness with respect to binary, multicategorical, and multiple sensitive attributes.

ID ITERATION
AB In this paper, we propose cautious policy programming (CPP), a novel value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that exploits the idea of monotonic policy improvement during learning. Based on the nature of entropy-regularized RL, we derive a new entropy-regularization-aware lower bound of policy improvement that depends on the expected policy advantage function but not on state-action-space-wise maximization as in prior work. CPP leverages this lower bound as a criterion for adjusting the degree of a policy update for alleviating policy oscillation. Different from similar algorithms that are mostly theory-oriented, we also propose a novel interpolation scheme that makes CPP better scale in high dimensional control problems. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can trade off performance and stability in both didactic classic control problems and challenging high-dimensional Atari games.

AB In this study, reinforced fuzzy radial basis function neural networks (FRBFNN) classifier driven by feature extracted data completed with the aid of effectively preprocessing techniques and evolutionary optimization, and its comprehensive design methodology are introduced. An Overall structure of the reinforced FRBFNN comprises the preprocessing part, the premise part and the consequence part of fuzzy rules of the network. In the preprocessing part, four types of preprocessing algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), combination of PCA and LDA (Hybrid PCA) and fuzzy transform are considered. To extract feature data suitable to characterize signal data, the feature extraction of information data is carried out through the dimensionality reduction done by the preprocessing technique, and then the reduced data are used as the input to the FRBFNN classifier. In the premise part of fuzzy rules of the network, the number of fuzzy rules is determined according to the number of clusters by fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering. The fitness values of individual fuzzy rules are obtained based on data distribution. In the consequence part of fuzzy rules of the network, the parameters of connection weights located between the hidden layer and the output layer of FRBFNN classifier are estimated by means of the least square estimation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited for structural as well as parametric optimization in the FRBFNN classifier. The parameters to be optimized by PSO are related to six factors such as the determination of whether to use data preprocessing, the type of data preprocessing technique, the number of input variables reduced by the preprocessing technique, fuzzification coefficient and the number of fuzzy rules used in fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, and the type of connection weights. By using diverse benchmark dataset obtained from UCI repository, the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier was evaluated. Through a variety of classification algorithms existed in the Weka data mining software (Weka), the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier was compared as well. The superiority of the proposed classifier is demonstrated through Friedman test. Furthermore, we assessed the classification performance of the reinforced FRBFNN classifier applied to black plastic wastes spectral data acquired from Raman and Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy equipment for the practical application of the material sorting system of the black plastic wastes.

AB Due to the severe COVID-19 pandemic, securing and processing patient's health data for decision-making is challenging. The proposed study introduces an edge computing-assisted hybrid deep learning mechanism to mitigate this issue. Initially, the first layer in a proposed framework collects the input images and forwards them to the edge layer. Here, several edge devices are deployed, and COVID-19 disease detection is performed through a new hybrid attention capsule autoencoder (HA_CAE). Finally, the samples are securely stored in the cloud layer, in which the reliability of patient information is increased. The simulation analysis shows that the proposed model gains higher detection performance, like accuracy (99.1%), precision (97.6%), sensitivity (98.9%), specificity (96.8%), F1-score (98.2%), and MCC (97.6%).

AB This article offers a conceptual and methodological contribution to linguistics by exploring the potential value of using sentiment analysis (SA) for research in this field. Firstly, it discusses the limitations and advantages of using SA for linguistics research including the wider epistemological implications of its application outside of its original conception as a product reviews analysis tool. Methodologically, it tests its applicability against an established linguistic case: the correlation between subjective attitudes such as surprise, irritation and discontent and the use of the progressive. The language example is Italian for which this function of the progressive form has not been analyzed yet. The analysis applies FEEL-IT, a state-of-the-art transformer-based machine learning model for emotion and sentiment classification in Italian on language samples from various sources as collected in Evalita-2014 (238,556 words). The results show statistically significant correlations between negative subjective attitudes and the use of the progressive in line with previous accounts in other languages. The article concludes with a few additional propositions for practitioners and researchers using SA.

AB Providing high degree of personalization to a specific need of each patient is invaluable to improve the utility of robot-driven neurorehabilitation. For the desired customization of treatment strategies, precise and reliable estimation of the patient's state becomes important, as it can be used to continuously monitor the patient during training and to document the rehabilitation progress. Wearable robotics have emerged as a valuable tool for this quantitative assessment as the actuation and sensing are performed on the joint level. However, upper-limb exoskeletons introduce various sources of uncertainty, which primarily result from the complex interaction dynamics at the physical interface between the patient and the robotic device. These sources of uncertainty must be considered to ensure the correctness of estimation results when performing the clinical assessment of the patient state. In this work, we analyze these sources of uncertainty and quantify their influence on the estimation of the human arm impedance. We argue that this mitigates the risk of relying on overconfident estimates and promotes more precise computational approaches in robot-based neurorehabilitation.

AB Cyber-attack activities are complex and ever-changing, posing severe challenges to cybersecurity personnel. Introducing knowledge graphs into the field of cybersecurity helps depict the intricate cybersecurity landscape and provides technical support for threat identification and situational awareness. However, during the process of constructing knowledge graphs, inevitable noise and conflicts may be introduced, leading to misleading inferences and decisions. This paper aims to address the issues of constructing and assessing the quality of cybersecurity knowledge graphs. We manually constructed a dataset of cybersecurity knowledge graphs (CS13K) and expanded the existing cybersecurity ontology, building a more versatile ontology applicable to existing data features. Building upon this, we utilized Neo4j to construct the cybersecurity knowledge graph. Furthermore, we propose an AttTucker model, based on Transformer, for assessing the quality of knowledge graphs. By employing numerous self-attention heads, this model captures latent information among entities and relations. While reducing the dimensionality of knowledge embeddings, the model achieves evaluation results comparable to high-dimensional embeddings. Finally, we incorporate the path-level information between entities in the knowledge graph into the evaluation of knowledge graph quality based on the AttTucker model. Experimental analysis on both generic datasets and cybersecurity datasets demonstrates that our model significantly improves F1 value and accuracy in knowledge graph quality assessment tasks, outperforming other models.

AB PurposeBetween 30 and 68% of patients prematurely discontinue their antidepressant treatment, posing significant risks to patient safety and healthcare outcomes. Online healthcare forums have the potential to offer a rich and unique source of data, revealing dimensions of antidepressant discontinuation that may not be captured by conventional data sources.MethodsWe analyzed 891 patient narratives from the online healthcare forum, "askapatient.com," utilizing content analysis to create PsyRisk-a corpus highlighting the risk factors associated with antidepressant discontinuation. Leveraging PsyRisk, alongside PsyTAR [a publicly available corpus of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to antidepressants], we developed a machine learning-driven algorithm for proactive identification of patients at risk of abrupt antidepressant discontinuation.ResultsFrom the analyzed 891 patients, 232 reported antidepressant discontinuation. Among these patients, 92% experienced ADRs, and 72% found these reactions distressful, negatively affecting their daily activities. Approximately 26% of patients perceived the antidepressants as ineffective. Most reported ADRs were physiological (61%, 411/673), followed by cognitive (30%, 197/673), and psychological (28%, 188/673) ADRs. In our study, we employed a nested cross-validation strategy with an outer 5-fold cross-validation for model selection, and an inner 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The performance of our risk identification algorithm, as assessed through this robust validation technique, yielded an AUC-ROC of 90.77 and an F1-score of 83.33. The most significant contributors to abrupt discontinuation were high perceived distress from ADRs and perceived ineffectiveness of the antidepressants.ConclusionThe risk factors identified and the risk identification algorithm developed in this study have substantial potential for clinical application. They could assist healthcare professionals in identifying and managing patients with depression who are at risk of prematurely discontinuing their antidepressant treatment.

DE Multi-scale; object detection; depth estimation; feature enhancement
AB Challenges such as complex backgrounds, drastic variations in target scales, and dense distributions exist in natural scenes. Some algorithms optimize multi-scale object detection performance by combining low-level and high-level information through feature fusion strategies. However, these methods overlook the inherent spatial properties of objects and the relationships between foreground and background. To fundamentally enhance the multi-scale detection capability, we propose a depth-constrained multi-scale object detection network that simultaneously learns object detection and depth estimation through a unified framework. In this network, depth features are merged into the detection branch as auxiliary information and constrained and guided to obtain better spatial representations, which enhances discrimination between multi-scale objects. We also introduce a novel cross-modal fusion (CmF) strategy that utilizes depth awareness and low-level detail clues to supplement edge information and adjust attention weight preferences. We find complementary information from RGB and high-quality depth features to achieve better multi-modal information fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the KINS dataset, with an improvement of 3.0% in AP score over the baseline network. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the KITTI dataset.

DE Deep learning; toxicity prediction; graph neural networks
AB Drug property prediction, especially toxicity, helps reduce risks in a range of real-world applications. In this paper, we aim to apply various machine-learning models for solving the drug toxicity prediction problem. Among various machine-learning approaches, we select five suitable representatives: random forest, multi-layer perceptron, logistic regression, graph convolutional neural network, and graph isomorphism network (GIN) for conducting experiments on six datasets for toxicity prediction, including Tox 21, ClinTox, ToxCast, SIDER, HIV, and BACE. We design the GIN with four hidden layers and select the Adam optimizer with the learning rate 10-4 and the batch size 256. Furthermore, we use a batch norm layer inside each of the GIN hidden layers. Experimental results show that the designed GIN model is most efficient in distinguishing between safe and toxic drugs and outperforms the others under the supervision of ROC AUC score and recall.

DE linear attention; kernel method; transformer; SE Block; self-attention
AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving advancements across various fields by simulating and enhancing human intelligence. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), transformer models like the Kerformer, a linear transformer based on a kernel approach, have garnered success. However, traditional attention mechanisms in these models have quadratic calculation costs linked to input sequence lengths, hampering efficiency in tasks with extended orders. To tackle this, Kerformer introduces a nonlinear reweighting mechanism, transforming maximum attention into feature-based dot product attention. By exploiting the non-negativity and non-linear weighting traits of softmax computation, separate non-negativity operations for Query(Q) and Key(K) computations are performed. The inclusion of the SE Block further enhances model performance. Kerformer significantly reduces attention matrix time complexity from O(N2) to O(N), with N representing sequence length. This transformation results in remarkable efficiency and scalability gains, especially for prolonged tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Kerformer's superiority in terms of time and memory consumption, yielding higher average accuracy (83.39%) in NLP and vision tasks. In tasks with long sequences, Kerformer achieves an average accuracy of 58.94% and exhibits superior efficiency and convergence speed in visual tasks. This model thus offers a promising solution to the limitations posed by conventional attention mechanisms in handling lengthy tasks.

AB The geometric design and shape optimization of complex surfaces are pivotal and knotty techniques in computer aided geometric design (CAGD), and widely used in many complex product manufacturing fields involving surfaces modeling, e.g., for ships, aircraft wing, automobiles, etc. In this paper, an enhanced golden jackal optimization (GJO) algorithm is used to optimize the shape of complex composite shape-adjustable generalized cubic Ball (CSGC-Ball, for short) surfaces. Firstly, the shape design of CSGC-Ball surfaces is mathematically an optimization problem that can be efficiently dealt with by meta-heuristic algorithms. In this regard, an enhanced GJO (EGJO), combined with opposition-based learning, spring vibration-based adaptive mutation and binomial-based cross-evolution strategy, is developed to improve the convergence speed and calculation accuracy of the original GJO. The performance of EGJO is assessed on 23 benchmark test functions, IEEE CEC-2019 and 4 actual engineering optimization problems, and the competition and practicability of EGJO algorithm are confirmed. Secondly, the CSGC-Ball surfaces with global and local shape parameters is constructed based on a class of cubic generalized Ball basis functions, and then the conditions of G1 and G2 continuity for the surfaces are derived. The shapes of CSGC-Ball surfaces can be adjusted and optimized expediently by utilizing their shape parameters. Finally, the minimum energy-based shape optimization models of CSGC-Ball surfaces with 1th-order and 2th-order geometric continuity are established, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed EGJO is utilized to solve the established optimization models, and the CSGC-Ball surfaces with minimum energy are obtained. Four representative examples are given to demonstrate the excellence and effectiveness of EGJO in solving the shape optimization problems of complex CSGC-Ball surfaces.

AB The presented work is concerned with the stability performance of frequency response for interconnected power systems (IPSs) with permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based wind turbines (WTs) via a decentralized control scheme against external and stochastic disturbances. To do this, initially, the state-space model is derived when a PMSG is penetration into IPSs. Differing from existing works, IPSs with PMSG-based WTs, including the stochastic disturbance, are modeled as a stochastic state-space model. Then, decentralized sampled-data load frequency control is designed to regulate the frequency response of the proposed model against the deterministic and stochastic noises. By constructing bilateral looped Lyapunov functional and using It & ocirc;s formula, stochastic sufficient conditions are derived, which ensure that the closed-loop form of the proposed model is asymptotically stable in the mean square with H8 performance index ?. Finally, three-area IPSs with PMSG-based WTs are validated with derived sufficient conditions. The simulation results confirmed the better-stability performance of frequency response for the proposed stochastic IPSs with PMSG-based WTs.

AB The obstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (OARSMT) problem plays an important role in the physical design of very large scale integrated circuits. It aims to find a Steiner tree with minimal wire length to connect all the terminal vertices in the routing region. Due to the existence of obstacles on the chip, it is more complex than rectilinear Steiner minimal tree problem which is known to be NP-complete. This article proposes a guiding solution based local search method (GSLS) to solve the OARSMT problem. First, we generate the escape graph for the OARSMT problem. Second, for an initial solution, we combine the U-shaped pattern refinement and the super edge replacement to optimize the solution. Third, we propose a guiding solution based local search to further improve the quality of solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed GSLS algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. In particular, GSLS improves the best known solution and obtains the optimal solutions for 1 and 19 out of 22 benchmark instances, respectively.

   Robust Sparse Orthogonal Label Regression
ID DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; KERNEL; RECOGNITION
AB Domain adaptation (DA) aims to enable a learning model trained from a source domain to generalize well on a target domain, despite the mismatch of data distributions between the two domains. State-of-the-art DA methods have so far focused on the search of a latent shared feature space where source and target domain data can be aligned either statistically and/or geometrically. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised DA method, namely Discriminative Noise Robust Sparse Orthogonal Label Regression-based Domain Adaptation (DOLL-DA). The proposed DOLL-DA derives from a novel integrated model which searches a shared feature subspace where data labels are orthogonally regressed using a label embedding trick, and source and target domain data are discriminatively aligned statistically through optimization of some repulse force terms. Furthermore, in minimizing a novel Noise Robust Sparse Orthogonal Label Regression(NRS_OLR) term, the proposed model explicitly accounts for data outliers to avoid negative transfer and introduces the property of sparsity when regressing data labels. We carry out comprehensive experiments in comparison with 35 state of the art DA methods using 8 standard DA benchmarks and 49 cross-domain image classification tasks. The proposed DA method demonstrates its effectiveness and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art DA methods with a margin which reaches 17 points on the CMU PIE dataset. To gain insight into the proposed DOLL-DA, we also derive three additional DA methods based on three partial models from the full model, namely OLR, CDDA+, and JOLR-DA, highlighting the added value of (1) discriminative statistical data alignment; (2) Noise Robust Sparse Orthogonal Label Regression; and (3) their joint optimization through the full DA model. In addition, we also perform time complexity and an in-depth empiric analysis of the proposed DA method in terms of its sensitivity w.r.t. hyper-parameters, convergence speed, impact of the base classifier and random label initialization as well as performance stability w.r.t. target domain data being used in training.

AB Fine-grained object recognition (FGOR) aims to learn discriminative features that can identify the subtle distinctions between visually similar objects. However, less effort has been devoted to overcoming the impact of object's personalized differences, e.g., varying posture or perspective. We argue that the personalized differences could decline the network's perception of discriminative features, thus discarding some discriminative clues and degrading the FGOR performance accordingly. This motivates us to explore the intrinsic structure knowledge: the fixed spatial correlation between object parts, and thus apply this knowledge to associate diverse semantic parts and recover the missing discriminative details caused by the personalized differences accordingly. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Structure-driven Relation Graph Network (SRGN) for fine-grained object recognition, and target at exploring and exploiting the object structure information without any additional annotations to associate diverse semantic parts, making the network sensitive to discriminative details influenced by personalized differences. Specifically, the core of SRGN is a Structure-aware Axial Graph (SAG) module, which first infers the structure embedding by establishing the correlation between position information and visual features along the axial direction, and then applies this embedding as aggregation weights to emphasize each discriminative representation by weighted reassembling all relevant features to it. Additionally, our SAG can be readily extensible to a multi-graph schema, that leverages the complementary advantages of different structure embeddings between the position information and visual content, further improving SAG. In this way, our SRGN can demonstrate remarkable robustness in scenarios characterized by extreme distribution perturbations, ultimately leading to superior performance. Extensive experiments and explainable visualizations validate the efficacy of the proposed approach on widely-used fine-grained benchmarks.

DE Property graph; Graph representation learning; GraphSAGE; Biased
   sampling; Latent connection
AB Graph representation learning (graph embedding) has led to breakthrough results in various machine learning graph-based applications such as node classification, link prediction and recommendation. Many real-world graphs can be characterized as the property graphs, because besides the structure information, there exists rich property information related to each node in the graphs. Many existing graph representation learning methods-e.g. random walk-based methods like DeepWalk and Node2vec, focus only on the structure of graph for learning the node embedding. Although graph representation learning based on neural networks (e.g. typical GNN methods such as GraphSAGE) uses the property of nodes as the initial features of nodes and then aggregates feature information of the neighbours, their limitation is that the neighbourhood of a node is considered to be uniform-i.e. there is no way to differentiate among neighbours of a node when learning a node embedding. Additionally, their definition of neighbourhood is local, i.e. only nodes connected to the current node are considered as neighbours. Hence, those methods fail to capture implicit/latent relationships among nodes, which are implicit in the given structure. In this study, our aim is to improve the performance of graph representation learning methods on property graphs. We present a new framework called Enhanced Property Graph Embedding (EPGE)-a graph representation learning framework to address above-mentioned limitations. Our proposed framework relies on the notion of latent neighbourhood, as well as systematic sampling of neighbouring nodes to obtain better representation of the nodes. The experimental results on five publicly available graph datasets demonstrate that EPGE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for the task of node classification. We further evaluate the superiority of our proposed formulation by defining a novel quantitative metric to measure the usefulness of the sampled neighbourhood in the graph.

   Nonlinear Multiagent Systems with Actuator Failures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB A fixed-time event-triggered consensus control method is proposed for uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems with actuator failures. Since actuator failures, external disturbances and control gains are time-varying and completely unknown, the effects of these system constraints on the system are completely unknown, which makes the implementation of fixed-time tracking control challenging. To deal with these system constraints, radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are applied to approximate the uncertain dynamics, and a boundary estimation method is presented to achieve adaptive compensation for them. Furthermore, considering that the implementation of this boundary estimation method requires a large number of communication resources, an event triggering mechanism is designed to reduce the update frequency of the controller. It is theoretically confirmed that using the proposed control scheme, all the followers can track the leader with sufficient accuracy in a predetermined time, and all the closed-loop signals are bounded. Finally, the simulation experiments verify the theoretical results.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive type of dementia characterized by loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, including speech. Since AD is a progressive disease, detection in the early stages is essential for the appropriate care of the patient throughout its development, going from asymptomatic to a stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and then progressing to dementia and severe dementia; is worth mentioning that everyone suffers from cognitive impairment to some degree as we age, but the relevant task here is to identify which people are most likely to develop AD. Along with cognitive tests, evaluation of the brain morphology is the primary tool for AD diagnosis, where atrophy and loss of volume of the frontotemporal lobe are common features in patients who suffer from the disease. Regarding medical imaging techniques, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are one of the methods used by specialists to assess brain morphology. Recently, with the rise of deep learning (DL) and its successful implementation in medical imaging applications, it is of growing interest in the research community to develop computer-aided diagnosis systems that can help physicians to detect this disease, especially in the early stages where macroscopic changes are not so easily identified. This article presents a DL-based approach to classifying MRI scans in the different stages of AD, using a curated set of images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies databases. Our methodology involves image pre-processing using FreeSurfer, spatial data-augmentation operations, such as rotation, flip, and random zoom during training, and state-ofthe-art 3D convolutional neural networks such as EfficientNet, DenseNet, and a custom siamese network, as well as the relatively new approach of vision transformer architecture. With this approach, the best detection percentage among all four architectures was around 89% for AD vs. Control, 80% for Late MCI vs. Control, 66% for MCI vs. Control, and 67% for Early MCI vs. Control.

AB Background: Nail diseases are malformations that appear on the nail plate and are classified according to their own signs and symptoms that may be related to other medical conditions. Although most nail diseases have distinct symptoms, making a differential diagnosis of nail problems can be challenging for medical experts.Method: One early diagnosis method for any dermatological disease is designing an image analysis system based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This article implemented a novel model using a publicly available nail disease dataset to determine the occurrence of three common types of nail diseases. Two classification models based on transfer learning using visual geometry group (VGGNet) were utilized to detect and classify nail diseases from images.Result and Finding: The experimental design results showed good accuracy: VGG16 had a score of 94% accuracy and VGG19 had a 93% accuracy rate. These findings suggest that computer-aided diagnostic systems based on transfer learning can be used to identify multiple-lesion nail diseases.

AB With the development of the express delivery industry, how to increase the recycling rate of waste cartons has become a problem that needs to be solved. Recycling enterprises began to provide the new recycling mode, door-to-door recycling services, to residents with waste cartons. In this article, we constructed a site selection model for a carton recycling site with the aim of maximizing total profits. Considering the residents' recycling willingness and the government subsidy earned through the contribution to carbon emission reduction, this model achieves the task of site selection and unit price fixation for carton recycling. We used the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve the model and compared it with the genetic algorithm (GA) for validity testing. PSO algorithm was also used to carry out sensitivity analysis in this model. The proposed model and the results of the sensitivity analysis can be used for decision-making in recycling enterprises as well as for further research on waste recycling and reverse logistics.

ID PRESENTATION ATTACK DETECTION
AB Face anti-spoofing is an important part of the face recognition algorithm that aims to prevent face presentation attacks. To facilitate face anti-spoofing research, this paper introduces a novel method in which a simple model provides enhanced performance on the RGB modality images of the CASIA-SURF dataset. Initially, a simple model based on ResNet-50 architecture is proposed that uses three residual layers of ResNet-50 along with a single neuron at the end for binary classification. Meanwhile, to judge the baseline performance, the proposed Resnet-50-based model is trained on the RGB and Depth images, separately. Later, to increase the performance of the proposed ResNet-50-based model on the RGB modality images, a novel Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) algorithm is applied. The LUPI contains Depth images and helps to train the inferior model with the help of a pre-trained superior model. Detailed simulations on the CASIA-SURF dataset reveal that an intelligent combination of the ResNet50 based model with the LUPI paradigm works exceptionally well and significantly improves the performance on the RGB modality of the images. The proposed model is less complex and can be deployed in resource-constrained environments.

AB Hedonic games are a prominent model of coalition formation, in which each agent's utility only depends on the coalition she resides. The subclass of hedonic games that models the formation of general partnerships (Larson 2018), where all affiliates receive the same utility, is referred to as hedonic games with common ranking property (HGCRP). Aside from their economic motivation, HGCRP came into prominence since they are guaranteed to have core stable solutions that can be found efficiently (Farrell and Scotchmer Q. J. Econ. 103(2), 279-297 1988). We improve upon existing results by proving that every instance of HGCRP has a solution that is Pareto optimal, core stable, and individually stable. The economic significance of this result is that efficiency is not to be totally sacrificed for the sake of stability in HGCRP. We establish that finding such a solution is NP-hard even if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 3; however, it is polynomial time solvable if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 2. We show that the gap between the total utility of a core stable solution and that of the socially-optimal solution (OPT) is bounded above by n, where n is the number of agents, and that this bound is tight. Our investigations reveal that computing OPT is inapproximable within better than O(n(1-epsilon)) for any fixed epsilon > 0, and that this inapproximability lower bound is polynomially tight. However, OPT can be computed in polynomial time if the sizes of the coalitions are bounded above by 2.

AB Artificial synapses are key elements in building bioinspired, neuromorphic computing systems. Ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs) with excellent controllability and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility are favorable to achieving synaptic functions with low power consumption and high scalability. However, because of the only nonvolatile ferroelectric (Fe) characteristics in the FeFET, it is difficult to develop bioplausible short-term synaptic elements for spatiotemporal information processing. By judiciously combining defects (DE) and Fe domains in gate stacks, a compact artificial synapse featuring spatiotemporal information processing on a single Fe-DE fin FET (FinFET) is proposed. The devices are designed to work in a separate DE mode to induce short-term plasticity by spontaneous charge detrapping, and a hybrid Fe-DE mode to trigger long-term plasticity through the coupling of defects and Fe domains. The capability of the compact synapse is demonstrated by differentiating 16 temporal inputs. Moreover, the highly controllable static electricity of advanced FinFETs leads to an ultralow power of 2 fJ spike-1. An all Fe-DE FinFET reservoir computing (RC) system is then constructed that achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.53% in digit classification. This work enables constructing RC systems with fully advanced CMOS-compatible devices featuring highly energy-efficient and low-hardware systems.
   A compact artificial synapse on single ferroelectric (Fe)-defects (DE) fin field-effect transistor (FinFET) is proposed by combining DE and Fe in gate stacks, accelerating the realization of full Fe-DE FinFET-based reservoir computing (RC) systems with low hardware cost. Owing to the advanced FinFET, ultralow power (2 fJ spike-1) is realized, indicating an energy-efficient RC system.image (c) 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Evolutionary computation is a powerful tool for solving nonconvex optimization problems. Generally, evolutionary algorithms take numerous fitness evaluations to obtain the potential optimal solutions. This poses a critical challenge for applying them to real-world complex engineering optimization problems. Recently, surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) have attracted an increasing amount of research. In this paper, a surrogate-assisted competitive swarm optimizer (SACSO) is proposed to exploit the potential of evolutionary algorithms to handle expensive optimization problems. In SACSO, global search, local search and opposition-based search are implemented as three different criteria to select the appropriate particle for realistic fitness evaluation. In order to trade off global exploitation and local exploration, a dynamic adaptation strategy is also proposed in this paper. Search approaches are dynamically adjusted to select a particle or perform variations at different stages of the algorithm. The combination of generalized surrogate model (GSM) with global search and elite surrogate model (ESM) with local and opposition-based search, effectively enhances the optimal performance of SACSO. The proposed SACSO is comprehensively compared with the state-of-the-art SAEAs and well-known EAs on seven benchmark functions. Additionally, SACSO is applied to the speed reducer design optimization problem. Experimental simulation results suggest SACSO is a prospective tool for dealing with expensive optimization problems.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) aims to automatically predict the sentiment polarity of the written text based on the analysis of specific aspects. By applying various pre-trained language encoders, recent studies have achieved great success in modeling aspect and context features and measuring the word-level correlations. However, the pre-trained language models (PLM) were usually employed as the feature representations generator without any task-oriented guidance. And the syntax dependency tree is also not fully utilized. Besides, simply concatenating usually fails to exploit deep semantic features from multi-source spaces and weakens the representation of context features. In this study, we propose a novel model, namely PRoGCN (Prompted RoBERTa & Graph Convolution Network), which directly tells RoBERTa the goal of the present task by inserting the task-oriented specific prompting word to the raw text. Moreover, the prompted feature representation is also utilized to help generate textual knowledge graph, and strongly enhances the syntactic feature representation. In addition, we first introduce cross attention into our study to integrate semantic representation and syntactic representation, which has been proven to be successful in implementing and fusing multi-source information. Experimental results on five publicly available ABSA datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mentioned ABSA benchmarks.

AB With the proliferation of social networks and their impact on human life, one of the rising problems in this environment is the rise in verbal and written insults and hatred. As one of the significant platforms for distributing text-based content, Twitter frequently publishes its users' abusive remarks. Creating a model that requires a complete collection of offensive sentences is the initial stage in recognizing objectionable phrases. In addition, despite the abundance of resources in English and other languages, there are limited resources and studies on identifying hateful and offensive statements in Persian. In this study, we compiled a 38K-tweet dataset of Persian Hate and Offensive language using keyword-based data selection strategies. A Persian offensive lexicon and nine hatred target group lexicons were gathered through crowdsourcing for this purpose. The dataset was annotated manually so that at least two annotators investigated tweets. In addition, for the purpose of analyzing the effect of used lexicons on language model functionality, we employed two assessment criteria (FPED and pAUCED) to measure the dataset's potential bias. Then, by configuring the dataset based on the results of the bias measurement, we mitigated the effect of words' bias in tweets on language model performance. The results indicate that bias is significantly diminished, while less than a hundredth reduced the F1 score.

AB Multi-task learning proved to be an effective strategy to increase the performance of a dense prediction network on a segmentation task, by defining auxiliary tasks to reflect different aspects of the problem and concurrently learning them with the main task of segmentation. Up to now, previous studies defined their auxiliary tasks in the Euclidean space. However, for some segmentation tasks, the complexity and high variation in the texture of a region of interest may not follow the smoothness constraint in the Euclidean geometry. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a new multi-task network, MTFD-Net, which utilizes the fractal geometry to quantify texture complexity through self-similar patterns in an image. To this end, we propose to transform an image into a map of fractal dimensions and define its learning as an auxiliary task, which will provide auxiliary supervision to the main segmentation task, towards betterment of left atrium (LA) segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal of a dense prediction network that employs the fractal geometry to define an auxiliary task and learns it in parallel to the segmentation task in a multi-task learning framework. Our experiments revealed that the proposed MTFD-Net model led to more accurate LA segmentations compared to its counterparts.

AB This article addresses a multilayer neural network (MNN)-based optimal adaptive tracking of partially uncertain nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems in affine form. By employing an actor-critic neural network (NN) to approximate the value function and optimal control policy, the critic NN is updated via a novel hybrid learning scheme, where its weights are adjusted once at a sampling instant and also in a finite iterative manner within the instants to enhance the convergence rate. Moreover, to deal with the persistency of excitation (PE) condition, a replay buffer is incorporated into the critic update law through concurrent learning. To address the vanishing gradient issue, the actor and critic MNN weights are tuned using control input and temporal difference errors (TDEs), respectively. In addition, a weight consolidation scheme is incorporated into the critic MNN update law to attain lifelong learning and overcome catastrophic forgetting, thus lowering the cumulative cost. The tracking error, and the actor and critic weight estimation errors are shown to be bounded using the Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results using the proposed approach on a two-link robot manipulator show a significant reduction in tracking error by 44% and cumulative cost by 31% in a multitask environment.

AB To address the emerging security challenges in Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), it is imperative that solutions go beyond the current infrastructure-centric measures. These methods, including authentication and access control, are insufficient to combat malware that conceals itself within ME applications. The acknowledged flaws in the ME application layer necessitate an immediate call for creative solutions. In this work, we propose a non-invasive security architecture for MEC, meticulously designed to strike a balance between performance burden and security protection capabilities. The objective of the design contains three major aspects, i.e. user experience, service density and serviceability. We conduct a thorough evaluation that enables us to quantify the significance of high bandwidth, low user experience latency and MEC serviceability. The experimental results and ablation studies indicate that our proposed method effectively balances user experience and security capabilities. This not only provides a practical and cost-effective solution but also establishes a strong precedent for the community to develop a secure MEC with superior performance in real-world production environments.

AB Function signature recovery is vital for many binary analysis tasks, led by control-flow integrity enhancement. To minimize human effort, existing works attempt to replace rule-based methods with learning-based methods. These works put a lot of work into improving the system's performance, but this had the unintended consequence of increasing resource usage. However, recovering the function signature is more about providing information for subsequent tasks, e.g. reverse engineering, so both efficiency and performance are significant.To identify the fundamental factors that increase efficiency, we attempt to optimize data-driven systems throughout their lifecycle from a data perspective. To this end, we perform detailed data analysis on a carefully collected dataset. After analysis and exploration, selective input is adopted and a multi-task learning (MTL) structure is introduced for function feature recovery to make full use of mutual information, and the computing resource overhead is optimized based on the observation of information deviation and sub-task relationship. The resource usage of the entire process is significantly reduced by our suggested solution, named Nimbus++ for efficient function signature recovery, without sacrificing performance. Our test findings demonstrate that we even surpass the state-of-the-art method's prediction accuracy across all function signature recovery tasks by about 1% with just about 12.5% of the processing time.

AB Data-intensive Web Applications built using client-server architectures usually provide prefetching mechanisms to enhance data accessibility. Prefetching is a strategy of retrieving data before it is requested so that it can be ready when the user requests it. Prefetching reduces the load on the web server by making data available before the user requests it. Prefetching can be used for static content, such as images and web pages, as well as dynamic content, such as search results. Prefetching can also be used to improve the performance of web applications, as the data is available quickly. There are several scheduling methods, such as time-based scheduling, event-based scheduling and priority-based scheduling, for prefetching to ensure that essential data is always ready when the user requests it. In this study, we focus on time-based scheduling for prefetching. We introduce time-based scheduling methodologies using sequential pattern mining techniques and long-term short memory-based deep learning strategies. To show the usefulness of these strategies, we develop a prototype application. We conduct an extensive experimental study to evaluate the performance of the proposed time-based scheduling methodologies using both performance and accuracy metrics. Based on the computed metrics, using proposed prefetching methods provided a promising cache hit rate when using the optimal cache size. The results show that the proposed prefetching methodologies are useful in data-intensive web applications for enhancing data accessibility. Work remains to investigate the use of attention-based sequence-to-sequence models in the web prefetching domain.

AB Real estate is a favored investment option as it allows investors to diversify their portfolios and minimize risk. Investors can invest in real estate directly by purchasing a property, or through real estate investment funds (REITs) where they can purchase shares in companies that own and manage real estate. Investing in REITs has become increasingly popular because it eliminates some of the disadvantages associated with direct real estate investment, such as the need for a large upfront payment. When investing in mixed asset portfolios, it is crucial to predict future prices accurately to ensure profitable and less risky asset allocation. However, literature on price prediction often focuses on only one or two algorithms, and there is no research that explores REITs' price prediction in the context of portfolio optimization. To address this gap, we conducted a thorough evaluation of 5 machine learning algorithms (ML), including Ordinary Least Squares Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long/Short-Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM), as well as other financial benchmarks like Holt's Exponential Smoothing (HES), Trigonometric Seasonality, Box-Cox Transformation, ARMA Errors, Trend, and Seasonal Components (TBATS), and Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We applied these algorithms to predict future prices for 30 REITs from the US, UK, and Australia, as well as 30 stocks and 30 bonds. The assets were then used as part of a portfolio, which we optimized using a genetic algorithm. Our results showed that using ML algorithms for price prediction provided at least three times the return over benchmark models and reduced risk by almost two-fold. For REITs, we observed that the use of ML algorithms led to a higher allocation to REITs diversified by country. In particular, our results showed that SVR was the best-performing algorithm in terms of risk-adjusted returns across different time horizons, as confirmed by our Friedman test results (Sharpe ratio). Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of ML algorithms in predicting asset prices and optimizing portfolio allocation.

AB The Bill of Materials (BOM) is the core data in the hierarchical production planning management of complex products. In the current competitive market environment and increasing demand for individual customization, complex product manufacturing enterprises are exploring methods that fully use common data and efficiently organize the BOM according to order requirements. However, due to the lack of a unified data modeling method for hierarchical production planning, BOM data at different levels cannot be interpenetrated. Moreover, the single-tree BOM lacks flexibility in describing the dynamic change process of data in different planning management stages (i.e., order receiving, variant design, and manufacturing execution). This paper proposes a BOM model transformation method for hierarchical production planning management to efficiently and accurately organize the data in different planning management stages of complex products. First, the Hierarchical Bill of Materials (HBOMs) model is constructed to integrate BOM data of different levels of planning. Subsequently, to describe the data requirements in HBOMs for different plan management stages, a composite HBOMs containing three types was designed. The Generic-HBOM (G-HBOM) aims to manage the common data of the same product type. The Instance-HBOM before-manufacturing (I-HBOM (BM)) and Instance-HBOM after-manufacturing (I-HBOM (AM)) manage the personality data of single product variant design and manufacturing execution stages, respectively. The transformation process models of HBOMs are constructed by analyzing the transformation logic between three types of HBOMs. To support the transformation process of HBOMs, five transformation operators are summarized, and the node traversal algorithm logic is proposed. Finally, a steam turbine generator product is taken as an example to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. This method can effectively improve the efficiency of BOM construction and reduce data redundancy while helping to ensure the integrity, consistency, and accuracy of BOM data.

AB The concept of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) has extensively used to handle the uncertainty of real-life decision making problems. The aim of this study is to propose an integrated multicriteria group decision making (MCGDM) approach with intuitionistic fuzzy information and apply to select the most suitable renewable energy source with respect to multiple aspects of sustainability criteria. For this purpose, we firstly propose an improved distance measure to quantify the degree of difference between IFSs. Some numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed measure over the existing distance measures under the context of IFS. Further, we develop a weighting approach to find the criteria weights, which combines the objective weighting model using improved distance measure and the subjective weighting model using stepwise weighted assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) with intuitionistic fuzzy information. Based on the proposed criteria weighting model, we develop an integrated weighted aggregated sum product assessment (IF-WASPAS) approach for solving MCGDM problems under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. To prove the applicability and efficacy of the developed approach, we implement it on a case study of renewable energy source selection problem with multiple aspects of sustainability including technical, socio-political, environmental, and economic perspectives. Moreover, the sensitivity and comparative analyses are discussed to examine the feasibility and steadiness of introduced approach in order to assess the RES options. In this paper, we present an improved decision making approach, which makes a significant contribution to the renewable energy sources evaluation process with uncertainty.

TI New attention strategy for negative sampling in knowledge graph

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article; Early Access
DE Knowledge graph; Embedding; Negative sampling; Attention mechanism
AB In the study of knowledge graph embedding (KGE), self-adversarial negative sampling is a recently proposed technique based on the attention mechanism, which pays more attention to the negative triplets with higher embedding scores. Unfortunately, the technique also pays more attention to those false negative triplets with higher embedding scores, which is obviously unreasonable and often leads to a performance downgrade of the KGE model. To alleviate the downgrade, this paper proposes a new attention strategy, aiming at gradually decreasing the attention of high-score false negative triplets. In the new strategy, the attention difference between high-score and low-score negative triplets will be narrowed as the KGE model performance improves, which is more reasonable during training. Experimental results on TransE, DistMult, RotatE, and PairRE show that our proposed strategy indeed has a significant performance improvement for KGE models on the task of linking prediction and triplet classification.

AB Most popular Siamese trackers optimize the classification map from the tracking head using a fixed cosine window penalty. However, this fixed operation, which sets the weight and center of the cosinewindowto fixed values, can lead to tracking errors when there are similar interferences or the target is out of view. In addition, traditional graph attention networks determine attention weights only based on the cosine similarity between nodes, ignoring the relationship between the positions of nodes in the template and search region. To address these issues, this paper proposes a spatial graph attention network-based object tracking with adaptive cosine window in tracking head. The adaptive cosine window combines spatial-temporal information and adjusts the cosine window, using a positional bias Kalman filter to predict the offset of the target in the search region. The location-based attention mask module considers both the similarity between nodes and their positions in the template and search region, rather than just node similarity, which reduces the impact of similar surroundings. The attention weights between nodes are constrained using a positionmatrix based on Gaussian functions. Extensive experiments on four challenging public datasets (GOT-10k, UAV123, OTB-100, and LaSOT) show that our tracker outperforms other state-of-the-art trackers.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

   aggregator; Preference propagation
AB In recent years, knowledge graphs (KGs) have attracted considerable attention in recommendation research based on auxiliary information. The rich semantic knowledge in a KG can enrich user and item representations and provide more accurate recommendations. Unfortunately, most previous studies failed to incorporate user/item interaction frequency, which plays a critical role in analyzing users' historical behaviors, into their recommendation models. Furthermore, the importance levels of users' historical preference features and users' KG preference features for modeling user preferences are different. Therefore, we propose an approach for jointly modeling the preferences of users and items with interaction frequency and attention (JMPIA), which first leverages an attention network with interaction frequency to obtain users' and items' historical preference representations and conducts preference propagation in a KG to obtain users' KG preference representations for each hop. Then, we leverage an attention aggregator with the ReLU activation function to aggregate these representations to capture more accurate user preferences, thereby promoting recommendation. Finally, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on two real-world datasets. The experimental results obtained on these two datasets demonstrate that the proposed JMPIA approach outperforms the state-of-the-art KG-based methods. These results validate the effectiveness of using an attention network with interaction frequency to derive preferences from users' historical interaction information and combining them with the rich information in a KG to integrate user preferences.

ID VESSEL SEGMENTATION; U-NET
AB The automatic artery/vein (A/V) classification in retinal fundus images plays a significant role in detecting vascular abnormalities and could speed up the diagnosis of various systemic diseases. Deep-learning methods have been extensively employed in this task. However, due to the lack of annotated data and the serious data imbalance, the performance of the existing methods is constricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-channel multi-scale fusion network (MMF-Net) that employs the enhancement of vessel structural information to constrain the A/V classification. First, the newly designed multi-channel (MM) module could extract the vessel structure from the original fundus image by the frequency filters, increasing the proportion of blood vessel pixels and reducing the influence caused by the background pixels. Second, the MMF-Net introduces a multi-scale transformation (MT) module, which could efficiently extract the information from the multi-channel feature representations. Third, the MMF-Net utilizes a multi-feature fusion (MF) module to improve the robustness of A/V classification by splitting and reorganizing the pixel feature from different scales. We validate our results on several public benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve the best result compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrate the superior performance of the MMF-Net. The highly optimized Python implementations of our method is released at: https://github.com/chenchouyu/MMF_Net.

AB Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality and high costs in the ICU. The early prediction and intervention of sepsis is a challenging task under strict time and cost constraints. In this paper, a novel High-order Markov Dynamic Bayesian Network (HMDBN) classifier with discrete features is presented for early prediction of sepsis at a high-order time point. The model structure is learned from the unrolled DBN by performing the K2 algorithm, and the features 'disappeared' in the prediction are eliminated using the VE method. Based on a few vital signs and laboratory results, an intuitive causal graph and indicating system are constructed to realize continuous prediction and probabilistic interpretation in real-time. Compared with other ten classical machine learning classifiers on evaluation metrics, HMDBN models have the highest AUROC scores on both internal tests and external validations for sepsis early prediction, and provide identifiable and interpretable results that allowing clinicians to immediately understand the reason for the prediction.

AB The neural network-based adaptive backstepping method is an effective tool to solve the cooperative tracking problem for nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs). However, this method cannot be directly extended to the case without continuous communication. It is because the discontinuous communication results in discontinuous signals in this case, the standard backstepping method is inapplicable. To solve this problem, a hierarchical design scheme that involves distributed cooperative estimators and neural network-based decentralized tracking controllers is proposed. By introducing a dynamic event-triggered mechanism, cooperative intermediate parameter estimators are first designed to estimate the unknown parameters of the leader. By using the interpolation polynomial method, these estimators are extended to smooth estimators with high-order derivatives to guarantee that the backstepping method is applicable. Based on the state of the smooth estimators, a backstepping-based decentralized neural network tracking controller is designed. It is shown that the tracking errors are asymptotically convergent and all the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded. Compared with the existing cooperative tracking results for nonlinear MASs with event-triggered communication, a more general class of MASs is considered in this article and a better performance in terms of asymptotic tracking is achieved. Finally, a simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of our developed method.

AB The rapid development of 5G network-connected Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted great attention of academia and industry with a huge demand for IoT application task processing, which is usually delay-sensitive with the constraints of resource limitation and cost budget. Facing the challenges of massive computing tasks, various users' requirements and resource limitations, this paper formulates a multi-objective optimization problem for computation offloading in a collaborative edge-cloud computing paradigm for handling various types of IoT tasks, aiming to provide efficient computing service to multiple IoT users. With the aim of minimizing task processing delay, mobile device energy consumption and economic cost, a discrete multi-objective Invasive Tumor Growth Optimization algorithm based on Invasive Tumor Growth Optimization is proposed to obtain diverse Pareto-optimal solutions, employing four types of cells with different search strategies to improve the search efficiency, convergence and diversity. Simulation results under complex scenarios show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the modeled computation offloading optimization problem of various task types and task scales and can also be well applied to a variety of different computing platforms. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposed algorithm achieves better convergence and diversity in three objectives, which implies superior performance, scalability and applicability.

AB Fog computing is an emerging approach to distributed computing. Faster public services and the potential saving of billions of lives are motivating the healthcare industry to create fog computing based on the Internet of Things (IoT). This novel computing platform, which is based on the fog computing paradigm, has the potential to increase the speed with which medical services may be delivered in both space and time by decreasing the latency experienced during signal transmission to far-off servers. Computing systems need to have features like low latency in order to facilitate healthcare tasks. The purpose of this research is to build a fog computing network to improve the quality of service (QoS) for data-based e-healthcare services using machine learning. The suggested model is utilized to develop the fog computing module for e-healthcare service data storage and increase service quality via the application of Markov reinforcement interference and Monte Carlo learning. Identifying the most effective fog nodes for IoT devices to minimize processing and communication delays is made easier with the development of a streamlined technique for large-scale IoT health monitoring systems. Also suggested is a more dynamic method of work allocation and load balancing. The proposed fog computing architecture uses Fog Bus and shows promise in terms of efficiency with respect to resources used, bandwidth used, jitter, latency, process execution time, and precision.

AB With the rapid development of information technology, third-party platforms have emerged and become the important channels to promote collaborations among manufacturing enterprises. Under this background, this paper focuses on a third-party platform whose multilateral users are manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers. There exist various cross-side network effects (i.e., CNEs) and same-side network effects (i.e., SNEs) among users (including manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers) at different development stages of the platform, which may affect the multi-value chain collaboration of users positively or negatively. By building a system dynamics model, this paper examines the interactions of the network effects and analyzes their impacts on the multi-value chain collaboration and platform's revenues. Then, the key factors that affect the network effect interactions are explored. The results show that the network effect interactions are significant in the early development stage of the platform. The growth of the SNEs of suppliers and logistics providers has significant impacts on their own CNEs and profits. Interestingly, the increase of manufacturers' SNEs can affect the CNEs of their own and suppliers simultaneously, which may decrease the profits of other participants but does not change their own profits. Affected by multiple network effects, the platform needs to implement a differentiated pricing strategy for its users. That is, the platform should charge suppliers and logistics providers access fee while giving manufacturers a certain subsidy. These findings can provide some valuable insights to the operation of the third-party platform.

AB With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, mobile agents are becoming more commonly used in a variety of industries that require high reliability from their control systems. In an uncertain environment, if the mobile agent control system's state transition includes only one plan, the system will enter the fault state immediately after the plan fails. Therefore, multiple alternative plans can be provided during the system design process to improve system reliability. First, this paper studies and describes the factors associated with the proposed multiple alternative plans, namely the success rate and plan implementation cost. Second, a Policy Generation Algorithm for identifying an appropriate execution sequence of those alternative plans is proposed. Furthermore, we propose a formal method-based pipeline framework for verifying the reliability of a mobile agent control system equipped with multiple alternative plans: we invoke the probabilistic model checking technique to create a Discrete-Time Markov Chain formal model of the mobile agent control system, convert the required properties into Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic formulae, and verify the model using the advanced probabilistic model checker PRISM. A case study is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the suggested methodological framework. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mobile agent control system with multiple alternative plans can improve system reliability while also meeting the least expected operational cost under the alternative plan set.

AB Cold-chain logistics presents significant challenges to sustainable development in terms of economics, society, and the environment. To address this issue, this paper focuses on solving a real-world problem-the multipath location-routing problem-based cold-chain logistics (MPLRPCCL), which considers soft time windows and heterogeneous fleets. The mathematical model aims to optimize the total logistics costs, including fuel consumption, carbon emissions, cargo deterioration, penalties, operating depots, and renting fleets. To effectively solve this problem, the paper proposes three versions of a memetic algorithm (MA) that incorporate control modules for monitoring the MA's performance and improving its global optimization performance. Computational evaluations were conducted, and the results show that the proposed algorithms are effective and outperform the classic MA framework. Furthermore, the proposed model and algorithms were applied to real-world cases in Hangzhou city, China, demonstrating their practical applicability. Overall, this paper offers a promising approach to tackling the complex challenges posed by cold-chain logistics and contributes to the sustainable development of this important field.

AB This article is concerned with the state estimation problem for a class of complex networks (CNs) with uncertain inner couplings and packet losses over communication networks. The inner couplings are allowed to be uncertain and varying in a specific interval. The amplify-and-forward (AaF) relay protocols are introduced to improve the communication quality and enhance the propagation distance. The Bernoulli random variables are used to characterize the randomly occurring packet losses encountered in communication channels. The focus of this article is on the design of a state estimator for each node of CNs such that a prescribed H-8 performance constraint is satisfied for the dynamical error system over a finite horizon. A sufficient condition is first provided to verify the existence of the desired H-8 state estimator, and the estimator gain is then determined by solving two coupled backward Riccati difference equations (RDEs). Subsequently, a recursive state estimation algorithm is put forward that is suitable for online computation. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed estimation method.

AB This article proposes a transient stability-constrained unit commitment (TSC-UC) model using input convex neural networks (ICNNs). An ICNN is trained to learn the transient function that maps prefault operation conditions (e.g., generator power output) to the transient stability index (TSI), which can be further utilized to identify the transient status (e.g., stable or unstable). Transient stability evaluation is conducted using the learned ICNN, without discretizing differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) or interacting with the time-domain simulation tools. Based on the convexity of ICNNs, the trained ICNN is exactly encoded as a linear programming (LP) model and integrated into conventional UC models to form a TSC-UC model. To impose transient stability constraints and expedite the solution process, the proposed TSC-UC model is decomposed into a UC master problem and two subproblems (i.e., network feasibility check subproblems and transient stability check subproblems). The decomposed problem is then iteratively solved using the Benders decomposition. Simulation tests are conducted in the New England 39-bus test system and IEEE 118-bus test system to verify the validity of the proposed approach.

One such factor is noise, random, and irrelevant influences that can skew outcomes.MethodsThis essay uses the CAT test and computer simulations to measure creativity.ResultsEvidence indicates that humans are intrinsically prone to noise, leading to inconsistent and, at times, inaccurate decisions. In contrast, simple rules demonstrate a higher level of accuracy and consistency, while artificial intelligence demonstrates an even higher capability to process vast data and employ logical algorithms.DiscussionThe potential of AI, particularly its intuitive capabilities, might be surpassing human intuition in specific decision-making scenarios. This raises crucial questions about the future roles of humans and machines in decision-making spheres, especially in domains where precision is paramount.

AB Violent crowd behavior detection has gained significant attention in the computer vision system. Diverse crowd behavior detection approaches are introduced to detect violent behavior but enhancing the recognition rate poses a complex task due to different crowd diversity, mutual occlusion between crowds, and diversity of monitoring scene. Therefore, a crowd behavior recognition mechanism is introduced by Conditional Autoregressive-Tunicate Swarm Algorithm based Generative Adversarial Network (CA-TSA based GAN) to detect violent behavior. Accordingly, the developed CA-TSA is modeled by inheriting Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk by Regression Quantiles with Tunicate Swarm Algorithm. Initially, the features, such as Tanimoto based Violence Flows descriptor, Local Ternary patterns, and Gray level co-occurrence matrix are extracted from the video frames. Then, the crowd behavior recognition is done by the GAN, which finds the abnormal and the normal crowd behaviors. Here, GAN is trained by the proposed CA-TSA. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method is analyzed using ASLAN challenge dataset. The developed model has the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity values of 93.688%, 94.261%, and 94.051%, respectively.

AB IntroductionTeleoperated robotic manipulators allow us to bring human dexterity and cognition to hard-to-reach places on Earth and in space. In long-distance teleoperation, however, the limits of the speed of light results in an unavoidable and perceivable signal delay. The resultant disconnect between command, action, and feedback means that systems often behave unexpectedly, reducing operators' trust in their systems. If we are to widely adopt telemanipulation technology in high-latency applications, we must identify and specify what would make these systems trustworthy.MethodsIn this requirements elicitation study, we present the results of 13 interviews with expert operators of remote machinery from four different application areas-nuclear reactor maintenance, robot-assisted surgery, underwater exploration, and ordnance disposal-exploring which features, techniques, or experiences lead them to trust their systems.ResultsWe found that across all applications, except for surgery, the top-priority requirement for developing trust is that operators must have a comprehensive engineering understanding of the systems' capabilities and limitations. The remaining requirements can be summarized into three areas: improving situational awareness, facilitating operator training, and familiarity, and easing the operator's cognitive load.DiscussionWhile the inclusion of technical features to assist the operators was welcomed, these were given lower priority than non-technical, user-centric approaches. The signal delays in the participants' systems ranged from none perceived to 1 min, and included examples of successful dexterous telemanipulation for maintenance tasks with a 2 s delay. As this is comparable to Earth-to-orbit and Earth-to-Moon delays, the requirements discussed could be transferable to telemanipulation tasks in space.

AB One of the most important engineering problems, with numerous uses in the applied sciences, is the synchronization of chaos dynamical systems. This paper introduces a dynamic-free T-S fuzzy sliding mode control (TSFSMC) method for synchronizing the different chaotic fractional-order (FO) systems, when there is input saturation. Using a new definition of fractional calculus and the fractional version of the Lyapunov stability theorem and linear matrix inequality concept, a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy sliding mode controller is driven to suppress and synchronize the undesired behavior of the FO chaotic systems without any unpleasant chattering phenomenon. Finally, an example of synchronization of complex power grid systems is provided to illustrate the theoretical result of the paper in real-world applications.

AB With the increasing volume of news articles available on the internet, personalized news recommendations have become increasingly important for users to discover relevant and interesting news articles. However, traditional recommender systems often fail to capture the dynamic nature of users' preferences and the changing trends in news articles. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a context-aware personalized news recommendation system that incorporates contextual information to enhance the personalization of news recommendations. The approach involves collecting, extracting, exploring, cleaning, and processing a large dataset of news articles from 19 distinct internet news sources, totaling 22,657 English pieces. Four different recommender systems were built using different techniques, including content-based methods such as TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and Word2Vec, and a collaborative filtering system based on click behavior. To evaluate the effectiveness of our models, we used a combination of standard comparison metric, including precision and recall, and user feedback. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, a web interface was constructed, and we used RMSE and MAE to evaluate the performance of the collaborative filtering model. In addition, we conducted a comparative study to compare the accuracy of different algorithms with different baseline methods, including random and recency. The evaluation results showed that incorporating contextual information and collaborative filtering can significantly improve the personalization of news recommendations. The study suggests that the collaborative filtering model based on click behavior is the most effective approach, with a mean MAE of 0.0252 and a mean RMSE of 0.0364. The content-based models were also effective approaches for recommending news articles, outperforming the baseline approaches.

AB The environmental damage caused by air pollution has recently become the focus of city council policies. The concept of the green city has emerged as an urban solution by which to confront environmental challenges worldwide and is founded on air pollution levels that have increased meaningfully as a result of traffic in urban areas. Local governments are attempting to meet environmental challenges by developing public traffic policies such as air pollution protocols. However, several problems must still be solved, such as the need to link smart cars to these pollution protocols in order to find more optimal routes. We have, therefore, attempted to address this problem by conducting a study of local policies in the city of Madrid (Spain) with the aim of determining the importance of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the need to optimise a set of routes for a fleet. The results of this study have allowed us to propose a framework with which to dynamically implement traffic constraints. This framework consists of three main layers: the data layer, the prediction layer and the event generation layer. With regard to the data layer, a dataset has been generated from traffic data concerning the city of Madrid, and deep learning techniques have then been applied to this data. The results obtained show that there are interdependencies between several factors, such as weather conditions, air quality and the local event calendar, which have an impact on drivers' behaviour. These interdependencies have allowed the development of an ontological model, together with an event generation system that can anticipate changes and dynamically restructure traffic restrictions in order to obtain a more efficient traffic system. This system has been validated using real data from the city of Madrid.

AB Using technology for sentiment analysis in the travel industry can extract valuable insights from customer reviews. It can assist businesses in gaining a deeper under-standing of their consumers' emotional tendencies and enhance their services' caliber. However, travel-related online reviews are rife with colloquialisms, sparse feature dimensions, metaphors, and sarcasm. As a result, traditional semantic representations of word vectors are inaccurate, and single neural network models do not take into account multiple associative features. To address the above issues, we introduce a dual-channel algorithm that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bi-directional long and short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention mechanism (DC-CBLA). First, the model utilizes the pre-trained BERT, a transformer-based model, to extract a dynamic vector representation for each word that corresponds to the current contextual representation. This process enhances the accuracy of the vector semantic representation. Then, BiLSTM is used to capture the global contextual sequence features of the travel text, while CNN is used to capture the richer local semantic information. A hybrid feature network combining CNN and BiLSTM can improve the model's representation ability. Additionally, the BiLSTM output is feature-weighted using the attention mechanism to enhance the learning of its fundamental features and lessen the influence of noise features on the outcomes. Finally, the Softmax function is used to classify the dual-channel fused features. We conducted an experimental evaluation of two data sets: tourist attractions and tourist hotels. The accuracy of the DC-CBLA model is 95.23% and 89.46%, and that of the F1-score is 97.05% and 93.86%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DC-CBLA model outperforms other baseline models.

AB The "single-valued neutrosophic set (SVNS)" is used to simulate scenarios with ambiguous, incomplete, or inaccurate information. In this article, with the aid of the Aczel-Alsina (AA) operations, we describe the aggregation operators (AOs) of SVNSs and how they work. AA t-norm (t-NM) and t-conorm (t-CNM) are first extended to single-valued neutrosophic (SVN) scenarios, and then we introduce several novel SVN operations, such as the AA sum, AA product, AA scalar multiplication, and AA exponentiation, by virtue of which we generate a few useful SVN AOs, for instance, the SVN AA weighted average (SVNAAWA) operator, SVN AA order weighted average (SVNAAOWA) operator, and SVN AA hybrid average (SVNAAHA) operator. Next, we create distinct features for such operators, group numerous exceptional cases together, and study the relationships between them. Following that, we created a way for "multiple attribute decision making (MADM)" in the SVN context using the SVNAAWA operator. We provided an illustration to substantiate the appropriateness and, additionally, the productiveness of the produced operators and strategy. Besides this, we contrasted the suggested strategy to the given procedures and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the new framework.

AB Supercritical airfoils are critical components in the design of commercial wide-body aircraft wings due to their ability to enhance aerodynamic performance in transonic flow regimes. However, traditional design methods for supercritical airfoils can be time-consuming and require significant manual effort, not to mention the high cost associated with computational fluid dynamics analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a highly automated approach for supercritical airfoil design, called Evolutionary Generative Design (EvoGD). The EvoGD approach is based on the framework of Evolutionary Computation and employs a series of sophisticated data-driven generative models incorporated with physical information to iteratively refine initial airfoil shapes, resulting in improved aerodynamic performances and reduced constraint violations. Moreover, to speed up the evaluation of the generated airfoils, a series of accurate and efficient data-driven predictors are utilized. The efficacy of the EvoGD approach was demonstrated through experiments on a dataset of 501 supercritical airfoils, including one baseline design and 500 randomly perturbed airfoils. On average, the generated airfoils showed improved performance in terms of buffet lift coefficient, cruise lift-to-drag ratio, and thickness by 5%, 4%, and 1%, respectively. The best generated airfoil outperformed the baseline design in terms of critical buffet lift coefficient and cruise lift-to-drag ratio by 7.1% and 6.4%, respectively. The entire design process was completed in less than an hour on a personal computer, highlighting the high efficiency and scalability of the EvoGD approach.

AB Electricity load forecasting is an essential operation of the power system. Deep learning is used to improve accurate electricity load forecasting. In this study, combining Long short-term memory and reinforcement learning are proposed to encourage the advantage of a single approach for forecasting. Importance input features, including the mutual feature of electricity load, are used to increase accuracy. First, multi-time series input can handle by Long short-term memory and the addition of features supports to the load feature will make the model better efficient. Because the LSTM model is quite complex, choosing a good set of hyperparameters is difficult. Therefore, the purpose of using reinforcement learning is to optimize hyper-parameters of the Long short-term memory model. The proposed model is the combination of Long-short term memory and reinforcement learning. The proposed model will be applied in two electricity load data sets, the real-life data of Vietnam Electricity and the other public data set. In one day ahead forecasting, the proposed model archives superior performance than the benchmark.

AB Specular highlight detection is an essential task with various applications in computer vision. This paper aims to detect specular highlights in single high-resolution images using deep learning while avoiding excessive GPU memory consumption. To achieve this, we present a high-resolution specular highlight detection dataset with manual annotations of specular highlights. Given our dataset, we propose a patch-level bidirectional refinement network for high-resolution specular highlight detection. The main idea is to utilize both the pathway from small-scale patch to large-scale patch and its reverse pathway to progressively refine the detection results of adjacent-scale specular highlight patches. Moreover, based on our detection network, we propose a modified inpainting framework for specular highlight removal as an application. Lastly, we provide ten potential research directions for specular highlight detection, inspiring researchers for further study.

AB Using multiple moving cameras with different and time-varying views can significantly expand the capability of multiple human tracking in larger areas and with various perspectives. In particular, the use of moving cameras of complementary top and horizontal views can facilitate multi-human detection and tracking from both global and local perspectives. As a new challenging problem that draws more and more attention in recent years, one main issue is the lack of a comprehensive dataset for credible performance evaluation. In this paper, we present such a new dataset consisting of videos synchronously recorded by drone and wearable cameras, with high-quality annotations of the covered subjects and their cross-frame and cross-view associations.

AB This study based on the standard differential evolution (DE) algorithm was carried out to address the issues of control parameter imprinting, mutation process, and crossover process in the standard DE algorithm as well as the issue of multidimensional circuit testing optimization. A rotation control vector was introduced to expand the search range in the poor strategy to the circumference range of the individual and the parent target individual, and a rotation crossover operator and a binomial poor operator were combined. Finally, an improved adaptive DE algorithm based on a multi-angle search rotation crossover strategy was obtained. The research will improve the DE algorithm to optimize the testing of multidimensional circuits. It can be noted that the improved average precision value is 0.9919 when comparing the precision recall curves of the DE algorithm before and after the change, demonstrating a significant improvement in accuracy and stability. The fitness difference of the 30-dimensional problem is discovered to be between 0.25 x 10(3) and 0.5 x 10(3) by comparing the box graphs of the 30-dimensional problem with that of the 50-dimensional problem. On the 50-dimensional problem, when calculating the F4-F10 function, the fitness difference of the improved DE algorithm is 0.2 x 10(4)-0.4 x 10(4). In summary, the improved DE algorithm proposed in this study compensates for the shortcomings of traditional algorithms in complex problem calculations and has also achieved significant optimization results in multidimensional circuit testing.

AB This article links three rarely considered dimensions related to the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies in the form of predictive policing and discusses them in relation to liberal democratic societies. The three dimensions are the theoretical embedding and the workings of AI within anomic conditions (1), potential normative disorders emerging from them in the form of thinking errors and discriminatory practices (2) as well as the consequences of these disorders on the psychosocial, and emotional level (3). Against this background, AI-induced anomie is conceptualized as a field of tension that refers to a systematic deterioration of democratic norms that are supposed to create 'normative orders', but which, when implemented through AI-supported measures, can reproduce existing discriminations, and establish new kinds of discriminatory relations. In future, these AI-based measures have the potential to lead to opposing normative disorders by emerging in the form of false social norms to an equally false Second Nature. They deprive persons involved of the possibility of individual appropriation of social norms and the specific emotional development associated with it.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB The ability of modern detectors to detect small targets is still an unresolved topic compared to their capability of detecting medium and large targets in the field of object detection. Accurately detecting and identifying small objects in the real-world scenario suffer from sub-optimal performance due to various factors such as small target size, complex background, variability in illumination, occlusions, and target distortion. Here, a small object detection method for complex traffic scenarios named deformable local and global attention (DLGADet) is proposed, which seamlessly merges the ability of hierarchical attention mechanisms (HAMs) with the versatility of deformable multi-scale feature fusion, effectively improving recognition and detection performance. First, DLGADet introduces the combination of multi-scale separable detection and multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to obtain richer contextual information for feature fusion while solving the misalignment problem of classification and localisation tasks. Second, a deformation feature extraction module (DFEM) is designed to address the deformation of objects. Finally, a HAM combining global and local attention mechanisms is designed to obtain discriminative features from complex backgrounds. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Code is available at

AB The increasing scale of modern chemical plants keeps popularizing investigation as well as application of distributed process monitoring approaches. With a goal of directly quantifying the normal relations between different blocks divided from the whole process, a novel multi-block modeling strategy called block-wise residual generator is proposed, which trains a residual generator for each block through using the partial least squares algorithm with single one output, so that the relation between the corresponding block and the others is quantified as a regression model in a block-wise manner. The deviations caused by the abnormal samples to the normal relations quantified for different blocks could thus be efficiently captured by the residuals generated from the block regression models, which then provide sensitive information for fault detection and contribution-based fault diagnosis. Moreover, the proposed method is applicable for both disjoint and overlapped block divisions, and the direct consideration of individually quantifying relations between different blocks can always guarantee its salient monitoring performance, as validated through comparisons with classical distributed process monitoring methods.

AB The performance of the planetary roller screw mechanism (PRSM) is directly determined by the mechanical behavior of the loaded contact. The traditional method based on a finite element modeling to describe the loaded contact characteristics (LCCs) is computationally expensive, while the use of Hertzian contact theory and the thread connection model results in a loss of computational accuracy. As a solution, this study aims to develop a semi-analytic modeling technique that can predict the LCCs of PRSM accurately and efficiently. To achieve this, the study first establishes a mathematical model using the spatial coordinate transformation theory to accurately describe the thread surface. The potential contact area is discretely divided using the differential geometry principle. Then, the linear deformation and nonlinear deformation are matched using node interpolation technique to obtain the accurate compliance of the potential contact area. Finally, the contact forces for all activated contact points are derived by a nonlinear iterative algorithm based on the influence coefficient method. The performance of the proposed model is verified by numerical examples. Further, the sensitivity weights of the geometric parameters to the LCCs are identified utilizing machine learning, and a preferred zone is also constructed to optimize these parameters. This study provides a valuable tool for evaluating and improving the LCCs of PRSM in engineering practice.

AB Researchers studying the correspondences between Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and humans often give little consideration to severe testing when drawing conclusions from empirical findings, and this is impeding progress in building better models of minds. We first detail what we mean by severe testing and highlight how this is especially important when working with opaque models with many free parameters that may solve a given task in multiple different ways. Second, we provide multiple examples of researchers making strong claims regarding DNN-human similarities without engaging in severe testing of their hypotheses. Third, we consider why severe testing is undervalued. We provide evidence that part of the fault lies with the review process. There is now a widespread appreciation in many areas of science that a bias for publishing positive results (among other practices) is leading to a credibility crisis, but there seems less awareness of the problem here.

AB The deep-learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods require an avalanche of training images. However, they do not adapt model parameters in test time to cope with the novel blur kernel scenarios. Even though the recent meta-learning-based SR techniques adapt trained model parameters leveraging a test image's internal patch recurrence, they need heavy pre-training on an external dataset to initialize. Also, the shallow internal information exploration and failure to amplify the salient edges impacts blurry SR image generation. Besides, model inferencing gets delayed due to a threshold-dependent adaptation phase. In this paper, we present Multi-scale Optimized Attention-aware Meta -Learning framework for SR (MAML-SR) to explore the multi scale hierarchical self-similarity of recurring patches in a test image. Precisely, without any pre-training, we directly meta-train our model with a second-order optimization having the first-order adapted parameters from the intermediate scales, which are again directly supervised with the ground-truth HR images. At each scale, non-local self-similarity is maximized along with the amplification of salient edges using a novel cross scale spectro-spatial attention learning unit. Also, we drastically reduce the inference delay by putting a metric-dependent constraint on the gradient updates for a test image. We demonstrate our method's superior super-resolving capability over four benchmark SR datasets.

AB Although networks with traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones have achieved remarkable results in red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) semantic segmentation, convolution cannot easily capture remote dependencies. Transformers encounter no such difficulties and can obtain richer global information. Therefore, we design an auxiliary context-information enhancement network (ACENet) using Swin Transformer as an auxiliary branch to assist the CNN backbone network. First, we input the outputs of each stage of Swin Transformer and ResNet-34 into a module that integrates local and global information and strengthens segmentation through multi-scale fusion and external attention. Then, we add spatial-depth information to the RGB image through a multi-modal fusion module to obtain a high-quality segmented image. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed ACENet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two common indoor-scene RGB-D semantic-segmentation datasets.

AB Unsupervised domain adaption (UDA), which transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, has attracted tremendous attention in many machine learning applications. Recently, there have been attempts to apply domain adaption for sensor time series data, such as human activity recognition and gesture recognition. However, existing methods suffer from some drawbacks that hinder further performance improvement. They often require access to source data or source models during training, which is unavailable in some fields because of privacy protection and storage limit. Typically, the source domains may only provide an application programming interface (API) for the target domain to call. On the other hand, current UDA methods have not considered the temporal consistency and low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of sensor time series. To address the challenges, this article presents a black-box domain adaption framework for sensor time series data (B2TSDA). First, we propose a single/multi-source teacher-student learning framework to distill the knowledge from the source domains to a customized target model. Then we design a new temporal consistency loss by combining an adaptive mask method and dynamic threshold method to maintain consistent temporal information and balance the learning difficulties of different classes. For the multisource black-box domain adaption, we further propose a Shapley-enhanced method to determine the contribution of each source domain. Experimental results on both single-source and multisource domain adaption show that our framework has superior performance compared to other black-box UDA methods.

AB Mobile robots are playing an increasingly significant role in social life and industrial production, such as searching and rescuing robots, autonomous exploration of sweeping robots, and so on. Improving the accuracy of autonomous navigation of mobile robots is a hot issue to be solved. However, traditional navigation methods are unable to realize crash-free navigation in an environment with dynamic obstacles, more and more scholars are gradually using autonomous navigation based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to replace overly conservative traditional methods. But on the other hand, DRL's training time is too long, and the lack of long-term memory easily leads the robot to a dead end, which makes its application in the actual scene more difficult. To shorten training time and prevent mobile robots from getting stuck and spinning around, we design a new robot autonomous navigation framework which combines the traditional global planning and the local planning based on DRL. Therefore, the entire navigation process can be transformed into first using traditional navigation algorithms to find the global path, then searching for several high-value landmarks on the global path, and then using the DRL algorithm to move the mobile robot toward the designated landmarks to complete the final navigation, which makes the robot training difficulty greatly reduced. Furthermore, in order to improve the lack of long-term memory in deep reinforcement learning, we design a feature extraction network containing memory modules to preserve the long-term dependence of input features. Through comparing our methods with traditional navigation methods and reinforcement learning based on end-to-end depth navigation methods, it shows that while the number of dynamic obstacles is large and obstacles are rapidly moving, our proposed method is, on average, 20% better than the second ranked method in navigation efficiency (navigation time and navigation paths' length), 34% better than the second ranked method in safety (collision times), 26.6% higher than the second ranked method in success rate, and shows strong robustness.

TI SentMask: A Sentence-Aware Mask Attention-Guided Two-Stage Text
   Summarization Component
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The text summarization task aims to generate succinct sentences that summarise what an article tries to express. Based on pretrained language models, combining extractive and abstractive summarization approaches has been widely adopted in text summarization tasks. It has been proven to be effective in many existing pieces of research using extract-then-abstract algorithms. However, this method suffers from semantic information loss throughout the extraction process, resulting in incomprehensive sentences being generated during the abstract phase. Besides, current research on text summarization emphasizes only word-level comprehension while paying little attention to understanding the level of the sentence. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose the SentMask component. Taking into account that the semantics of sentences that are filtered out during the extraction process is also worth considering, the paper designs a sentence-aware mask attention mechanism in the process of generating a text summary. By applying the extractive approach, the paper first selects the most essential sentences to construct the initial summary phrases. This information leads the model to modify the weights of the attention mechanism, which provides supervision for the generative model to ensure that it focuses on the sentences that convey important semantics while not ignoring others. The final summary is constructed based on the key information provided. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves higher ROUGE and BLEU scores compared to other baseline models on two benchmark datasets.

AB Metaheuristic optimization algorithms manage the search process to explore search domains efficiently and are used efficiently in large-scale, complex problems. Transient Search Algorithm (TSO) is a recently proposed physics-based metaheuristic method inspired by the transient behavior of switched electrical circuits containing storage elements such as inductance and capacitance. TSO is still a new metaheuristic method; it tends to get stuck with local optimal solutions and offers solutions with low precision and a sluggish convergence rate. In order to improve the performance of metaheuristic methods, different approaches can be integrated and methods can be hybridized to achieve faster convergence with high accuracy by balancing the exploitation and exploration stages. Chaotic maps are effectively used to improve the performance of metaheuristic methods by escaping the local optimum and increasing the convergence rate. In this study, chaotic maps are included in the TSO search process to improve performance and accelerate global convergence. In order to prevent the slow convergence rate and the classical TSO algorithm from getting stuck in local solutions, 10 different chaotic maps that generate chaotic values instead of random values in TSO processes are proposed for the first time. Thus, ergodicity and non-repeatability are improved, and convergence speed and accuracy are increased. The performance of Chaotic Transient Search Algorithm (CTSO) in global optimization was investigated using the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)'17 benchmarking functions. Its performance in real-world engineering problems was investigated for speed reducer, tension compression spring, welded beam design, pressure vessel, and three-bar truss design problems. In addition, the performance of CTSO as a feature selection method was evaluated on 10 different University of California, Irvine (UCI) standard datasets. The results of the simulation showed that Gaussian and Sinusoidal maps in most of the comparison functions, Sinusoidal map in most of the real-world engineering problems, and finally the generally proposed CTSOs in feature selection outperform standard TSO and other competitive metaheuristic methods. Real application results demonstrate that the suggested approach is more effective than standard TSO.

AB Natural language annotations and manuals can provide useful procedural information and relations for the highly specialized scenario of autonomous robotic task planning. In this paper, we propose and publicly release AUTOMATE, a pipeline for automatic task knowledge extraction from expert-written domain texts. AUTOMATE integrates semantic sentence classification, semantic role labeling, and identification of procedural connectors, in order to extract templates of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) relations that can be directly implemented in any sufficiently expressive logic programming formalism for autonomous reasoning, assuming some low-level commonsense and domain-independent knowledge is available. This is the first work that bridges natural language descriptions of complex LTL relations and the automation of full robotic tasks. Unlike most recent similar works that assume strict language constraints in substantially simplified domains, we test our pipeline on texts that reflect the expressiveness of natural language used in available textbooks and manuals. In fact, we test AUTOMATE in the surgical robotic scenario, defining realistic language constraints based on a publicly available dataset. In the context of two benchmark training tasks with texts constrained as above, we show that automatically extracted LTL templates, after translation to a suitable logic programming paradigm, achieve comparable planning success in reduced time, with respect to logic programs written by expert programmers.

AB Robot navigation in crowded environments has recently benefited from advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. However, it still presents a challenge to designing socially compliant robot behavior. Avoiding collisions and the difficulty of predicting human behavior are crucial and challenging tasks while the robot navigates in a congested social environment. To address this issue, this study proposes a dynamic warning zone that creates a circular sector around humans based on the step length and speed of humans. To properly comprehend human behavior and keep a safe distance between the robot and the humans, warning zones are implemented during the robot's training using deep enforcement learning techniques. In addition, a short-distance goal is established to help the robot efficiently reach the goal through a reward function that penalizes it for going away from the goal and rewards it for advancing towards it. The proposed model is tested on three state-of-the-art methods: collision avoidance with deep reinforcement learning (CADRL) , long short-term memory (LSTM-RL), and social attention with reinforcement learning (SARL). The suggested method is tested in the Gazebo simulator and the real world with a robot operating system (ROS) in three scenarios. The first scenario involves a robot attempting to reach a goal in free space. The second scenario uses static obstacles, and the third involves humans. The experimental results demonstrate that the model performs better than previous methods and leads to safe navigation in an efficient time.

ID COST AGGREGATION
AB Stereo matching is a fundamental technique for many vision and robotics applications. State-of-the-art methods either employ convolutional neural networks with spatially-shared kernels or utilize content-dependent interactions (e.g., local or global attention) to augment convolution operations. Despite of great improvements being made, existing methods could either suffer from a high computational cost arising from global attention operations or a suboptimal performance at edge regions due to spatially-shared convolutions. In this paper, we propose a CoAtRS stereo matching method to exert the complementary advantages of convolution and attention to the full via region separation. Our method can adaptively adopt the most suitable feature extraction and aggregation patterns for smooth and edge regions with less computational cost. In addition, we propose D-global attention which performs global filtering on the disparity dimension to better fuse cost volumes of different regions and alleviate the locality defects of convolutions. Our CoAtRS stereo matching method can also be embedded conveniently in various existing 3D CNN stereo networks. The resulting networks can achieve significant improvements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we design an accurate network (named CoAtRSNet) which achieves the state-of-the-art results on five public datasets. At the time of writing, CoAtRSNet ranks 1st-3rd on all the metrics published on the ETH3D website, ranks 2nd on Scene Flow, and ranks 1st for the Root-Mean-Square metric, 2nd for the average error metric and 3rd for the bad 0.5 metric on the Middlebury benchmark.

   level vision
AB Most studies on convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image processing have proposed networks that can be optimized for a single level. Here, the term "level" refers to the specific objective defined for each task, such as the degree of noise in denoising tasks. Hence, they underperform on other levels and must be retrained to deliver optimal performance. Using multiple models to cover multiple levels involves very high computational costs. To solve these problems, recent approaches train the networks on two different levels and propose their own modulation methods to enable the arbitrary intermediate levels. However, many of them 1) have difficulty adapting from one level to the other, 2) suffer from unintended artifacts in the intermediate levels, or 3) require large memory and computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework using Filter Transition Network (FTN), which is a non-linear module that easily adapts to new levels, is regularized to prevent undesirable side-effects, and extremely lightweight being a data-independent module. Additionally, for stable learning of FTN, we newly propose a method to initialize nonlinear CNNs with identity mappings. Extensive results for various image processing tasks indicate that the performance of FTN is stable regarding adaptation and modulation and is comparable to that of the other heavy frameworks.

AB With the support of artificial intelligence, speech emotion recognition is integrated into people's daily lives in the form of smart speakers. Some high-accuracy models have poor applicability due to their large size. However, the accuracy of lightweight models is unsatisfactory. In this article, an integrated framework based on GLobal-Aware Multiscale with channel shuffle (FF-GLAM-cs) is proposed, fusing multiple lightweight models to ensure a small size and high accuracy. Channel shuffle is added to solve the computational duplication caused by multiscale convolution. In addition, a fuzzy integral fusion method is adopted that describes the interactions of classifiers ignored by traditional methods. The impact of different combinations of classifiers is analyzed. In experiments, the performance of the new model and the effect of fusion are verified by the model to four speech emotion datasets. The model is validated and analyzed with parameter and ablation testing, kernel model comparisons and fusion verification. The results show that FF-GLAM-cs is superior to state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the fusion module presents excellent improvements in accuracy.

AB Training, sports equipment, and facilities are the main aspects of sports advancement. Countries are investing heavily in the training of athletes, especially in table tennis. Athletes require basic equipment for exercises, but most athletes cannot afford the high cost; hence, the necessity for developing a low-cost automated system has increased. To enhance the quality of the athletes' training, the proposed research focuses on using the enormous developments in artificial intelligence by developing an automated training system that can maintain the training duration and intensity whenever necessary. In this research, an intelligent controller has been designed to simulate training patterns of table tennis. The intelligent controller will control the system that sends the table tennis balls' intensity, speed, and duration. The system will detect the hand sign that has been previously assigned to different speeds using an image detection method and will work accordingly by accelerating the speed using pulse width modulation techniques. Simply showing the athletes' hand sign to the system will trigger the artificial intelligent camera to identify it, sending the tennis ball at the assigned speed. The artificial intelligence of the proposed device showed promising results in detecting hand signs with minimum errors in training sessions and intensity. The image detection accuracy collected from the intelligent controller during training was 90.05%. Furthermore, the proposed system has a minimal material cost and can be easily installed and used.

AB Brain Computer Interface is an emerging technology for assisting patients having long term disability. Electroencephalography is the best technique for recording neural activities, however, recording bio signal data from patients is a hectic task. Therefore, Data augmentation using generative adversarial networks is expected to solve this problem. In this paper, we present temporal generative adversarial network with conditional input labels to learn the spatio-temporal features of electroencephalograph and generate realistic data. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed model, we introduce qualitative, quantitative and feature visualization techniques on motor imagery electroencephalograph dataset. Further, we used 1-dimensional temporal convolutional neural network to investigate whether augmented data can replace real data or not for training models. The presented data augmentation framework was compared to three more data augmentation techniques like: copula generative adversarial network, conditional tabular generative adversarial network and tabular variational autoencoder. Our presented technique showed significantly better results to other data augmentation techniques for Electroencephalograph data. The experimental results show that the value of Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL Divergence) and Inverted Kolmogorov Smirnov D static test (KS test) of data generated by proposed model is the lowest i.e., 0.8940 and 0.7674 respectively. Further, we have tested exhaustively our new data and used a new testing strategy achieving an accuracy of 94.1%. Finally, it is concluded that a time series-based data augmentation technique for Electroencephalograph can reduce long calibration process and thus improve the overall performance of motor imagery user action classification.

AB Recently, graph-based neural networks have been investigated in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification to address the limited global feature representation capability issue of HSI classification methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, most of the existing graph-based neural networks for HSI classification methods either characterize the relation information by the pair-wise modeling or rely on the CNNs to extract the local spectral-spatial features. To solve this problem, in this paper, a concise hypergraph convolutional network (HGCN) is proposed for semi-supervised HSI classification. To effectively and efficiently capture the global and local features of HSI, the hypergraph model is established on superpixel level which characterizes the spectral affinities rather than the spatial distance. The designed hypergraph model not only incorporates the local homogeneity and complex correlations of HSI but also consumes little computation. Two hypergraph convolution layers are designed to propagate and update the features of nodes. To construct an end-to-end architecture, a mapping matrix is defined for pixels encoding and superpixels decoding. The proposed method is hinged on the goodness the clustering algorithm used in superpixel segmentation and the experiments has shown that the clustering algorithm affects the effectiveness of proposed method. Thus, we give a strategy for selecting the segmentation parameter. The comparison experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark HSI data sets demonstrate that the proposed method provides more stable and effective classification performance than some state-of-the-art deep approaches with very limited training samples. The overall accuracies are 95.42% on Indian Pines, 98.48% on Kennedy Space center, 98.23% on Salinas Valley and 96.91% on Pavia University.

AB The contribution of our work is two-fold. First, we propose a novel feature selection technique, sparsity-promoted centroid-encoder (SCE). The model uses the nonlinear mapping of artificial neural networks to reconstruct a sample as its class centroid and, at the same time, apply a l(1)-penalty to the weights of a sparsity promoting layer, placed between the input and first hidden layer, to select discriminative features from input data. Using the proposed method, we designed a feature selection framework that first ranks each feature and then, compiles the optimal set using validation samples. The second part of our study investigates the role of stochastic optimization, such as Adam, in minimizing l(1)-norm. The empirical analysis shows that the hyper-parameters of Adam (mini-batch size, learning rate, etc.) play a crucial role in promoting feature sparsity by SCE. We apply our technique to numerous real-world data sets and find that it significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, including LassoNet, stochastic gates (STG), feature selection networks (FsNet), supervised concrete autoencoder (CAE), deep feature selection (DFS), and random forest (RF).

AB Physical reservoir computing, which is a promising method for the implementation of highly efficient artificial intelligence devices, requires a physical system with nonlinearity, fading memory, and the ability to map in high dimensions. Although it is expected that spin wave interference can perform as highly efficient reservoir computing in some micromagnetic simulations, there has been no experimental verification to date. Herein, reservoir computing is demonstrated that utilizes multidetected nonlinear spin wave interference in an yttrium-iron-garnet single crystal. The subject computing system achieves excellent performance when used for hand-written digit recognition, second-order nonlinear dynamical tasks, and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (NARMA). It is of particular note that normalized mean square errors for NARMA2 and second-order nonlinear dynamical tasks are 1.81 x 10(-2) and 8.37 x 10(-5), respectively, which are the lowest figures for any experimental physical reservoir so far reported. Said high performance is achieved with higher nonlinearity and the large memory capacity of interfered spin wave multidetection.

AB Perceiving surface characteristics through tactile interaction typically requires high-resolution devices or precise spatial scanning to record and analyze a significant amount of information. However, most available tactile sensors require complicated technological processes, redundant layouts, and data acquisition circuits, which limits their ability to provide a real-time static perception and feedback for potential applications such as robotic manipulation. Drawing inspiration from the sliding tactile (ST) perception mode of the human fingertip, a robust and flexible ST sensor with a low array density of 2.7 cells cm(-2) is reported. This innovative sensor has a soft and cambered configuration that allows it to rapidly and accurately recognize the 3D surface features of objects, including grooves as small as 500 & mu;m. Benefiting from the strong correlation between collected electronic responding and local deformation of sensing cell, the ST sensor can adaptively reconstruct surface patterns with the assistance of deep learning, even on unstructured objects. The pattern recognition system based on the robot is demonstrated by accurately classifying a set of mahjong tiles with nearly 100% accuracy, surpassing human tactile perception capabilities in the same task.

AB Structural failures are often caused by catastrophic events such as earthquakes and winds. As a result, it is crucial to predict dynamic stress distributions during highly disruptive events in real time. Currently available high-fidelity methods, such as Finite Element Models (FEMs), suffer from their inherent high complexity. Therefore, to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy, a Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN), PINN-Stress model, is proposed to predict the entire sequence of stress distribution based on Finite Element simulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) solver. Using automatic differentiation, we embed a PDE into a deep neural network's loss function to incorporate information from measurements and PDEs. The PINN-Stress model can predict the sequence of stress distribution in almost real-time and can generalize better than the model without PINN.

AB Exploration is a crucial component of reinforcement learning. Although many works employ random noise to explore, few have employed exploration based on action gradients. The common use of random noise exploration methods has several weaknesses; for instance, they encounter the problem of dimension disaster. In contrast, action gradient-based methods only use first-order information, thus utilizing information poorly. To address this gap, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that employs an exploration teacher to teach an agent to explore. This framework uses both first-order and second-order information of the action gradient. Additionally, the attention prediction method in our framework aims to address the problem of Q-value overestimation. Based on our new framework and the TD3 algorithm, we propose an off-policy deterministic actor-critic algorithm, named more Effective and Efficient Exploration via more Refined Gradient Information (3E-RGI). Our 3E-RGI algorithm uses a new stage-wise updating method to increase training efficiency. We compare 3E-RGI with five other off-policy algorithms on six DMControl suite environments. The experiment shows that our algorithm outperforms current reinforcement learning algorithms in various continuous control problems from the DMControl suite.

AB Time series data mining techniques have attracted extensive attention from researchers worldwide. Of these techniques, time series classification is an important part of time series mining. Among the many time series classification algorithms, methods based on the bag-of-patterns algorithm have attracted much attention from researchers because of their high accuracy and execution efficiency. However, when using these methods, only the frequency of different patterns is considered. Features such as the position of patterns in a sequence are not mined. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to determine how to solve the problem that the positional relationships among patterns are ignored when using the bag-of-patterns algorithm. To solve this issue, we introduce the graph embedding technique, and an attempt is made to capture the positional relationships among the patterns of time series from the graph perspective. To verify the performance of the method, we perform extensive experiments with the UCR time series archive, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method generally improves the classification ability of models based on the bag-of-patterns algorithm.

AB Due to inter-class homogeneity and intra-class variability, the classification of skin lesions in dermoscopy images has remained difficult. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved satisfactory performance for binary skin cancer classification, multiclass skin lesion classification is still an open problem due to the limited training samples and class imbalance issues. To tackle these issues, in this article, we propose a multi-CNN ensemble approach dubbed M2CE$$ {\mathrm{M}}<^>2\mathrm{CE} $$ for multiclass skin lesion classification. The M2CE$$ {\mathrm{M}}<^>2\mathrm{CE} $$ includes three individual CNN models, each helping in extracting different high-level features from skin images and thereby yielding different prediction results. First, we design a lightweight CNN model to extract prominent features and train it from scratch, which primarily aims at avoiding the data scarcity problem. Then, we ensemble two different pre-trained CNN models with the lightweight model to improve the performance and generalization capability. The proposed ensemble approach can effectively fuse the predictions of each individual CNN model using the averaging method. The M2CE$$ {\mathrm{M}}<^>2\mathrm{CE} $$ approach is validated using a benchmark data set, HAM10000, which contains skin lesion images of seven different classes. The results demonstrate that the M2CE$$ {\mathrm{M}}<^>2\mathrm{CE} $$ outperforms base CNN models and state-of-the-art approaches without using any external data.

AB With the development of smart technologies (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Big Data), people have start using them for various purposes. The real-time IoT devices generate an enormous amount of video and imaging data, leading to the concept of complex data structure. And people face major challenges in mining and extraction of useful features and information from such data. How to efficiently analyse and process video data to obtain valuable information has become a key research topic. The traditional manual annotation methods are unable to meet the current demand for the growing number of videos. Therefore, a more convenient method for processing video data needs to be developed. The research objective of this paper is dance videos, and the goal is to realize automatic recognition of dance movements. In this paper, a Dual Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm (DCNNA) is proposed for the automatic recognition of different dance movements in live and remote videos. DCNNA can extract video information more comprehensively and efficiently. It can simultaneously extract the light flow features corresponding to the action changes and the information contained in each frame of the video. Therefore, the dance movements can be more accurately identified. In the experiments, the performance of DCNNA is evaluated based on dance videos and compared with Inception V3 and 3D-CNN. All the experiments illustrate the superior performance of the proposed DCNN algorithm. From the experimental results, it is quite obvious that the F1 score of the proposed DCNNA is 11% and 6% higher than that of the Inception V3 and 3D-CNN, respectively.

AB In recent years, rainfall prediction has received major attention in research areas because of its demanding applications in pollution control management and flood control management. Despite having numerous learning-based approaches to calculate future rainfall trends, it remains inefficient to predict rainfall occurrences by learning linear and nonlinear data patterns of historical weather information (i.e., exact prediction value is complicated to be predicted). These complications are addressed with the evolution of stochastic models which have a greater ability to minimize prediction bias and represent long-term weather variability. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel modified stochastic fuzzy Aquila (MSFA) algorithm to make precise predictions regarding future trends by evaluating rainfall time series data. The proposed MSFA algorithm is applied in rainfall prediction applications in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic model. Here, 10 features of the open weather dataset collected from Tamil Nadu are provided as input for the proposed rainfall prediction design. The data inconsistencies such as undesirable format and missing values are structured using preprocessing procedures, namely data arrangement, null value removal, and data partitioning. The preprocessed data are fed into the proposed MSFA algorithm which learns the data features more precisely and predicts the probable occurrence of rainfall. To evaluate the performances of the proposed MSFA algorithm, the metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination, root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are analyzed. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed MSFA algorithm achieves superior performance in terms of all metrics.

AB In recent years, the rapid development of mobile devices and embedded system raises a demand for intelligent models to address increasingly complicated problems. However, the complexity of the structure and extensive parameters press significantly on efficiency, storage space, and energy consumption. Additionally, the explosive growth of tasks with enormous model structures and parameters makes it impossible to compress models manually. Thus, a standardized and effective model compression solution achieving lightweight neural networks is established as an urgent demand by the industry. Accordingly, Dynamic Channel Ranking Strategy (DCRS) method is proposed to compress deep convolutional neural networks. DCRS selects channels with high contribution of each prunable layer according to compression ratio searched by reinforcement learning agent. Compared with current model compression methods, DCRS efficaciously applies various channel ranking strategies on prunable layers. Experiments indicate with a 50% compression ratio, compressed MobileNet achieved 70.62% top1 and 88.2% top5 accuracy on ImageNet, and compressed ResNet achieved 92.03% accuracy on CIFAR-10. DCRS reduces more FLOPS in these neural networks. The compressed model achieves the best Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy on ResNet50, the best Top-1 accuracy on MobilNetV1.

AB Multiobjective optimization problems exist widely in practical applications involving large-scale decision variables and sparse Pareto optimal solutions. However, in terms of sparse detection, the existing sparse Large-scale MOEAs ignore global interaction characteristics in the evolutionary stage, which easily leads to the loss of key variables and inhibits convergence. Based on that, this paper proposes the use of a matrix to evaluate the decision variable correlations and perform adaptive updates, which achieve the highest accuracy of sparse relationship mining. Specifically, the control variable method and Pareto dominance relations generate an original matrix in the initial stage. Then, with reference to the mask distribution of the contemporary nondominated solutions, the matrix is updated in the evolutionary phase by means of the nondominated ordering of a parent and the corresponding offspring for rewards and penalties. Furthermore, a new genetic operator is proposed to ensure the sparsity of the generated solutions. According to the experimental results of eight benchmark problems, the algorithm outperforms existing evolutionary algorithms in solving sparse LSMOPs.

AB In recent times, the neural image captioning (NIC) is considered as a primitive problem artificial intelligence (AI) in which creates a connection between computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). However, recent attribute-based and textual semantic attention-based models in NIC still encounter challenges related to irrelevant concentration of the designed attention mechanism on the relationship between extracted visual features and textual representations of corresponding image's caption. Moreover, recent NIC-based models also suffer from the uncertainties and noises of extracted visual latent features from images which sometime leads to the disruption of the given image captioning model to sufficiently attend on the correct visual concepts. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an end-to-end integrated deep fuzzy-neural network with the unified attention-based semantic-enhanced vision-language approach, called as FuzzSemNIC. To alleviate noises and ambiguities from the extracted visual features, we apply a fused deep fuzzy-based neural network architecture to effectively learn and generate the visual representations of images. Then, the learnt fuzzy-based visual embedding vectors are combined with selective attributes/concepts of images via a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to incorporate the fused latent visual features into captioning task. Finally, the fused visual representations are integrated with a unified vision-language encoder-decoder for handling caption generation task. Extensive experiments in benchmark NIC-based datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed FuzzSemNIC model.

AB Nowadays, the issue of fluctuations in the price of digital Bitcoin currency has a striking impact on the profit or loss of people, international relations, and trade. Accordingly, designing a model that can take into account the various significant factors for predicting the Bitcoin price with the highest accuracy is essential. Hence, the current paper uses market sentiment and multiple feature extraction to present several Bitcoin price prediction models based on convolutional neural network and long short-term memory. In the proposed models, several parameters, including Twitter data, news headlines, news content, Google Trends, Bitcoin-based stock, and finance, are employed based on deep learning to make a more accurate prediction. Such parameters are the input data used to predict the Bitcoin price. Besides, the proposed model analyzes the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner sentiments to examine the market's latest news and cryptocurrencies. According to this study's various inputs and analyses, several effective feature selection methods, including mutual information regression, linear regression, correlation-based, and a combination of the feature selection models, are exploited to predict the price of Bitcoin. Finally, a careful comparison is made between the proposed models in terms of some performance criteria like mean square error (MSE), root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, median absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R-2). The obtained results indicate that the proposed hybrid model based on sentiments analysis and combined feature selection with MSE value of 0.001 and R-2 value of 0.98 provides better estimations with more minor errors regarding Bitcoin price. This proposed model can also be employed as an individual assistant for more informed trading decisions associated with Bitcoin.

The proposed method improves the best solution found by the evolutionary algorithm by modifying schedules for some of the retailers according to those present in the known good solution or to schedules provided by a domain expert. The experiments shown that to improve the optimization results it suffices to perform a few repetitions of the knowledge import procedure. This observation motivates further research on user-interactive optimization algorithms for the IRP, because the number of interactions needed to improve the results can easily be handled by the user.

AB In this study, asynchronous sliding-mode control (SMC) for discrete-time networked hidden stochastic jump systems subjected to the semi-Markov kernel (SMK) and cyber attacks is investigated. Considering the statistical characteristic of the SMK, which is challenging to acquire in engineering, this study recognizes the SMK to be incomplete. Due to the mode mismatch between the original system and the control law in the operating process, a hidden semi-Markov model is proposed to describe the considered asynchronous situation. The main aim of this study is to construct an asynchronous SMC mechanism based on an incomplete SMK framework under the condition of random denial-of-service attacks so that the resulting closed-loop system can realize the mean-square stability. By virtue of the upper bound of the sojourn time in each mode, innovative techniques are developed for mean-square stability analysis under an incomplete SMK. Furthermore, an asynchronous SMC scheme is designed to achieve the reachability of the quasi-sliding mode. Finally, the effectiveness is verified using an electronic throttle model.

AB In this article, an adaptive optimal consensus control problem is studied for multiagent systems (MASs) with external disturbances, unmeasurable states, and prescribed constraints. First, by using neural networks (NNs), a composite observer is constructed to estimate the unmeasurable states and disturbances simultaneously. Then, the consensus error is guaranteed within a prescribed boundary by presenting an improved prescribed performance control (PPC) technique, and the initial conditions for the error are eliminated. In addition, the updating laws of actor-critic NNs are established by using a simplified reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based on the uniqueness of optimal solution, and the asymmetric input saturation is resolved by designing auxiliary system instead of using nonquadratic cost functions in other optimal control methods. Finally, the boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is proved by using Lyapunov stability theory. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified by a simulation example.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Knowledge graph; meta learning (ML); reinforcement learning (RL); value
   regularization policy; visual navigation
AB The goal of visual navigation is steering an agent to find a given target object with current observation. It is crucial to learn an informative visual representation and robust navigation policy in this task. Aiming to promote these two parts, we propose three complementary techniques, heterogeneous relation graph (HRG), a value regularized navigation policy (VRP), and gradient-based meta learning (ML). HRG integrates object relationships, including object semantic closeness and spatial directions, e.g., a knife is usually co-occurrence with bowl semantically or located at the left of the fork spatially. It improves visual representation learning. Both VRP and gradient-based ML improve robust navigation policy, regulating this process of the agent to escape from the deadlock states such as being stuck or looping. Specifically, gradient-based ML is a type of supervision method used in policy network training, which eliminates the gap between the seen and unseen environment distributions. In this process, VRP maximizes the transformation of the mutual information between visual observation and navigation policy, thus improving more informed navigation decisions. Our framework shows superior performance over the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of success rate and success weighted by length (SPL). Our HRG outperforms the Visual Genome knowledge graph on cross-scene generalization with approximate to 56% and F139% improvement on Hits@5(& lowast;) (proportion of correct entities ranked in top 5) and MRR & lowast; (mean reciprocal rank), respectively. Our code and HRG datasets will be made publicly available in the scientific community.

AB This paper addresses the tracking control problem of a complex-valued nonlinear system. First, an augmented complex-valued tracking error system is constructed. By separating the real part and the imaginary part, the augmented complex-valued system is translated into a real-valued augmented system. The tracking control problem of a complex-valued system is converted into an optimal regulation of the real-valued augmented system. An event-based controller is proposed to solve the optimal regulation of the augmented system. Then, an ADP-based framework is used to realize the controller, which is composed of an action network and a critic network. The action network is specially formulated for obtaining control input and the critic network is specially formulated for generating performance value. Both two networks are complex-valued neural networks. Through well-designed event-triggered conditions, the tracking error is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) and the Zeno behaviors are excluded. The algorithm is applied to complex-valued signal tracking to demonstrate its effectiveness.

   tracking
AB Recently, the excellent performance of transformer has attracted the attention of the visual community. Visual transformer models usually reshape images into sequence format and encode them sequentially. However, it is difficult to explicitly represent the relative relationship in distance and direction of visual data with typical 2-D spatial structures. Also, the temporal motion properties of consecutive frames are hardly exploited when it comes to dynamic video tasks like tracking. Therefore, we propose a novel dynamic polar spatio-temporal encoding for video scenes. We use spiral functions in polar space to fully exploit the spatial dependences of distance and direction in real scenes. We then design a dynamic relative encoding mode for continuous frames to capture the continuous spatio-temporal motion characteristics among video frames. Finally, we construct a complex-former framework with the proposed encoding applied to video-tracking tasks, where the complex fusion mode (CFM) realizes the effective fusion of scenes and positions for consecutive frames. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method. The experimental results on multiple datasets validate that our method can improve tracker performance in various video scenarios.

AB Spatio-temporal data are critical for intelligent systems, such as smart transportation and smart cities. However, due to sensor failure or power failure, the spatiotemporal data missing tends to have a big impact on downstream tasks. Meanwhile, if sensors are scarce, some spatial positions without sensors need data enhancement through intelligent methods. Existing workarounds focus on modeling temporal information (such as time series), often ignoring spatial dependency, or modeling the spatial and temporal domain separately for imputation. In this paper, we propose a Longterm Multi-dimensional Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (LMSTGCN), which not only inductively estimates some missing data, but also achieves data augmentation of target locations. It contains a periodic temporal encoding mechanism, a gated temporal capture module, and a multidimensional spatial-temporal GCN module. The long-term temporal dependencies are captured by the periodic temporal encoding mechanism. The spatial and extra-short-term temporal dependencies are simultaneously modeled by the multi-dimensional GCN module, which can achieve exponential growth in the range of receptive fields. Corresponding to this module, we designed a spatiotemporal adjacency matrix construction method. It generates spatiotemporal adjacency matrices of corresponding time length as needed. The short-term dependencies in sequences are captured by the gated temporal capture module. In experimental analysis, results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on real-world data sets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data-driven methods routinely achieve promising results on remaining useful life prediction, but under a window-manner end-to-end paradigm, they suffer from unsatisfying generalization ability and low inter-pretability, as the consequence of neglecting diverse modes among the entire degradation processes of different entities. This article proposes a novel Transformer-based network, to tackle the problem by integration of global and local information. During offline training, the paired inputs containing full life and piece data are constructed, and then using cross-attention between the encoder and the decoder, the consistent position of the piece data in the full life is derived, which is directly associated with the degradation state. The designed paired inputs and model architecture ensures the strong generalization because the prediction result considering global information is adaptive to diverse degradation modes. Further, the designed cross-attention discrepancy utilizes prior knowledge of the consistent position such that similar degradation states are aligned more properly. Such a consistent position, visualized by the cross-attention distribution, is supposed to represent the intuitive relationship between degradation level and monitoring data, thus provides inherent interpretability about the prediction process. Finally, predictions of the online monitoring piece data with respect to all historical full lives with different degradation modes are aggregated to the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two datasets of turbofan and bearing show that our model provides competitive performance, especially under complicated working conditions and fault modes, achieving averagely 5.9% score reduction compared with the state-of-the-art method.

AB Robust constrained formation tracking control of underactuated underwater vehicles (UUVs) fleet in 3-D space is a challenging but practical problem. To address this problem, this article develops a novel consensus-based optimal coordination protocol and a robust controller, which adopts a hierarchical architecture. On the top layer, the spherical coordinate transform is introduced to tackle the nonholonomic constraint, and then a distributed optimal motion coordination strategy is developed. As a result, the optimal formation tracking of UUVs fleet can be achieved, and the constraints are fulfilled. To realize the generated optimal commands better and, meanwhile, deal with the underactuation, at the lower-level control loop a neurodynamics-based robust backstepping controller is designed, and in particular, the issue of "explosion of terms" appearing in conventional backstepping-based controllers is avoided and control activities are improved. The stability of the overall UUVs formation system is established to ensure that all the states of the UUVs are uniformly ultimately bounded in the presence of unknown disturbances. Finally, extensive simulation comparisons are made to illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the derived optimal formation tracking protocol.

AB This article is concerned with the maximum correntropy filtering (MCF) problem for a class of nonlinear complex networks subject to non-Gaussian noises and uncertain dynamical bias. With aim to utilize the constrained network bandwidth and energy resources in an efficient way, a componentwise dynamic event-triggered transmission (DETT) protocol is adopted to ensure that each sensor component independently determines the time instant for transmitting data according to the individual triggering condition. The principal purpose of the addressed problem is to put forward a dynamic event-triggered recursive filtering scheme under the maximum correntropy criterion, such that the effects of the non-Gaussian noises can be attenuated. In doing so, a novel correntropy-based performance index (CBPI) is first proposed to reflect the impacts from the componentwise DETT mechanism, the system nonlinearity, and the uncertain dynamical bias. The CBPI is parameterized by deriving upper bounds on the one-step prediction error covariance and the equivalent noise covariance. Subsequently, the filter gain matrix is designed by means of maximizing the proposed CBPI. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to substantiate the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed MCF scheme.

ID UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION; INSTABILITY
AB Due to the increasing availability of large datasets provided by high-fidelity numerical simulations (HFNSs) of physical phenomena, data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) have become a reliable alternative to those described by partial differential equations, especially when dealing with optimization problems that require multiple evaluations of parameter dependent solutions. These models may be built through different method-ologies, among which are the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and operator learning frameworks (OLFs). While some recent studies suggest that PINNs have some difficulties in handling convective-dominant physical systems, others show OLFs struggle to accurately predict state variables of interest along the testing interval. In the present work, a ROM for the two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection flow was built through an incremental proper orthogonal decomposition (IPOD) of a high-fidelity dataset followed by a non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) approach. Then, the predictive capabilities of the model were assessed for two test cases with different high Rayleigh numbers (Ra = 109 and Ra = 1011). Very good agreements were achieved between the OpInf-based ROMs and the HFNSs for temperature and velocity fields along training and testing intervals. For instance, time-averaged normalized ROM errors along the testing interval for all the flow variables were below 15% at a given probe location when Ra = 109. For each case, while the computational fluid dynamics simulation took about 2 h, the reduced model required less than 3 s to predict the system's states given its initial condition. This fact illustrates the substantial computational time reduction provided by the ROM. Regarding the case in which the Rayleigh number is higher, the ROM had more difficulties in approximating velocity fields due to the existence of more complex turbulence patterns. Finally, the quality of the data decomposition and of the selected regularization technique, often seen in artificial intelligence algorithms, was investigated. The results suggest the OpInf technique may be successfully applied on the surrogate modeling of turbulent buoyancy-driven flows.

DE Posted price auctions; Bayesian persuasion; Revenue maximization
ID PERSUADING VOTERS
AB We study single-item single-unit Bayesian posted price auctions, where buyers arrive sequentially and their valuations for the item being sold depend on a random, unknown state of nature. The seller has complete knowledge of the actual state and can send signals to the buyers so as to disclose information about it. For instance, the state of nature may reflect the condition and/or some particular features of the item, which are known to the seller only. The problem faced by the seller is about how to partially disclose information about the state so as to maximize revenue. Unlike classical signaling problems, in this setting, the seller must also correlate the signals being sent to the buyers with some price proposals for them. This introduces additional challenges compared to standard settings. As a preliminary step, we show that, w.l.o.g., the seller can deterministically propose a price to each buyer on the basis of the signal being sent to that buyer, rather than selecting prices stochastically and arbitrarily correlating them with signals sent to all the buyers. Next, we consider two cases: the one where the seller can only send signals publicly visible to all buyers, and the case in which the seller can privately send a different signal to each buyer. As a first step, we prove that, in both settings, the problem of maximizing the seller's revenue does not admit an additive FPTAS unless P = NP, even for basic instances with a single buyer. As a result, in the rest of the paper, we focus on designing additive PTASs. In order to do so, we first introduce a unifying framework encompassing both public and private signaling, whose core result is a decomposition lemma that allows focusing on a finite set of possible buyers' posteriors. This forms the basis on which our additive PTASs are developed. In particular, in the public signaling setting, our PTAS employs some ad hoc techniques based on linear programming, while our PTAS for the private setting relies on the ellipsoid method to solve an exponentially-sized LP in polynomial time. In the latter case, we need a custom approximate separation oracle, which we implement with a dynamic programming approach.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The teaching of the optimization algorithm is a new kind of swarm intelligence optimization technique, which is superior in optimizing many simple functions. Still, it is not evident in processing some complex problems (group and teaching classification). Achieving automatic matching and knowledge transfer in online courses is imperative in mathematics education. This study proposes a design scheme MTCBO-LR (multiobjective capability optimizer-logistic regression), based on multitask optimization, which enables precise knowledge transfer and data interaction among many educators. It incorporates the standard TLBO algorithm to optimize, provides a variety of learning tactics for students at different stages of mathematics instruction, and is capable of adaptively adjusting these strategies in response to actual teaching needs. Experimental results on various datasets reveal that the proposed method enhances searchability and group diversity in various optimization extremes and outperforms similar methods in resolving to multitask teaching problems.

AB Background: Due to various factors such as the increasing aging of the population and the upgrading of people's health consumption needs, the demand group for rehabilitation medical care is expanding. Currently, China's rehabilitation medical care encounters several challenges, such as inadequate awareness and a scarcity of skilled professionals. Enhancing public awareness about rehabilitation and improving the quality of rehabilitation services are particularly crucial. Named entity recognition is an essential first step in information processing as it enables the automated extraction of rehabilitation medical entities. These entities play a crucial role in subsequent tasks, including information decision systems and the construction of medical knowledge graphs.Methods: In order to accomplish this objective, we construct the BERT-Span model to complete the Chinese rehabilitation medicine named entity recognition task. First, we collect rehabilitation information from multiple sources to build a corpus in the field of rehabilitation medicine, and fine-tune Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) with the rehabilitation medicine corpus. For the rehabilitation medicine corpus, we use BERT to extract the feature vectors of rehabilitation medicine entities in the text, and use the span model to complete the annotation of rehabilitation medicine entities.Result: Compared to existing baseline models, our model achieved the highest F1 value for the named entity recognition task in the rehabilitation medicine corpus. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms in recognizing both long medical entities and nested medical entities in rehabilitation medical texts.Conclusion: The BERT-Span model can effectively identify and extract entity knowledge in the field of rehabilitation medicine in China, which supports the construction of the knowledge graph of rehabilitation medicine and the development of the decision-making system of rehabilitation medicine.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Automated image-based plant identification systems are black-boxes, failing to provide an explanation of a classification. Such explanations are seen as being essential by taxonomists and are part of the traditional procedure of plant identification. In this paper, we propose a different method by extracting explicit features from flower images that can be employed to generate explanations. We take the benefit of feature extraction derived from the taxonomic characteristics of plants, with the orchids as an example domain. Feature classifiers were developed using deep neural networks. Two different methods were studied: (1) a separate deep neural network was trained for every individual feature, and (2) a single, multi-label, deep neural network was trained, combining all features. The feature classifiers were tested in predicting 63 orchid species using naive Bayes (NB) and tree-augmented Bayesian networks (TAN). The results show that the accuracy of the feature classifiers is in the range 83-93%. By combining these features using NB and TAN the species can be predicted with an accuracy of 88.9%, which is better than a standard pre-trained deep neural-network architecture, but inferior to a deep learning architecture after fine-tuning of multiple layers. The proposed novel feature extraction method still performs well for identification and is explainable, as opposed to black-box solutions that only aim for the best performance.

AB Human brain can recognize facial expressions in a short period of time. The complex multi-stage processing of neural activities in facial expression recognition is involved. Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has excellent performance comparable to human, and its hierarchical structure is inspired by the human visual system.There is an inextricable relationship between DCNN and neural activity in the human brain that has not yet been elucidated. Our research aims to construct a brain-inspired DCNN model and explore its spatiotemporal correlation with the human brain in the process of facial expression recognition. In this study, we first propose a brain-inspired computing model with DCNN architecture integrating attention mechanism for facial expression recognition, and then we compare temporally specific brain data (electroencephalogram) with the model representation to acquire the correlation time series between the human brain and the model. And we compare representations between the spatially specific fMRI and the model to reveal the spatial maps. Experimental results show that our proposed model reaches 96.43% recognition accuracy. Further, the comparison between the model and neural activity in the human brain shows that there is a significant spatiotemporal correspondence between the complex multi-stage processing of the human brain and the hierarchical computation of the model. Our study provides new insights into the association between the spatiotemporal dynamics of human brain and the brain-inspired computing model during facial expression recognition.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Multi-view subspace clustering, which partitions multi-view data into their respective underlying subspaces, has achieved the remarkable clustering performance by extracting abundant complementary information from data of different views. However, existing subspace clustering methods almost suffer from very heavy computational burden that restricts their capacity on computational efficiency for large-scale datasets. Recently, hashing/binary code learning has attracted intensive attentions due to fast Hamming distance computation and much less storage requirement, but existing related research does not explore underlying subspace clustering structure well that widely exists in real-world data. In order to handle the both issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-view subspace clustering method named Hashing Multi-view Sparse Subspace Learning (HMSSL). HMSSL incorporates multi-view binary code learning and binary sparse subspace learning with a "thin" dictionary into a unified framework. HMSSL encodes multi-view real-valued features in the original space into compact common binary codes in the Hamming space for fast Hamming distance computation by multi-view binary code learning and learns the binary sparse subspace representation matrix for exploring the underlying subspace clustering structure efficiently and effectively by binary sparse subspace learning with a "thin" dictionary matrix. All the columns of the dictionary matrix are randomly and uniformly sampled from all the columns of the compact common binary code matrix. We design an effective binary optimization algorithm based on alternating direction multiplier method and analyze its time complexity. Extensive experiments performed on six benchmark multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HMSSL in comparison with ten state-of-the-art baselines in this field.

AB A new extremely simple ensemble-based model with the uniformly generated axis-parallel hyper-rectangles as base models (HRBM) is proposed. Two types of HRBMs are studied: closed rectangles and corners. The main idea behind HRBM is to consider training examples inside and outside each rectangle. It is proposed to incorporate HRBMs into the gradient boosting machine (GBM) to construct effective ensemble-based models and to avoid overfitting. A simple method for calculating optimal regularization parameters of the model, which can be modified in the explicit way at each iteration of GBM, is considered. Moreover, a new regularization called the "step height penalty" is studied in addition to the L1 and L2 regularizations. An extremely simple approach to the proposed ensemble-based model prediction interpretation by using the well-known method SHAP is proposed. It is shown that GBM with HRBM can be regarded as a model extending a set of interpretable models for explaining black-box models. Numerical experiments with real datasets illustrate the proposed GBM with HRBMs for regression and classification problems. The best p-values in the t-test comparing the proposed model with the well-known ensemble-based regression and classification models are 0.004 and 0.0031, respectively. Experiments also illustrate computational efficiency of the proposed SHAP modifications. The code of proposed algorithms implementing GBM with HRBM is publicly available.

   Sclera recognition
AB Sclera segmentation is a key component of sclera recognition, which decides the region-of-interest (ROI) for recognition and has a considerable impact on the overall performance. In recent years, a growing interest has been seen in deep learning-based sclera segmentation. Despite their promising segmentation performance for diverse eye images, they are still inherently limited in generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we aimto bridge this gap and learn a generalized sclera segmentation model that can handle new unseen domains well. To this end, we introduce meta-learning in the sclera segmentation problem and propose an effective learning framework, named MetaScleraSeg. Specifically, we first design a meta-sampling strategy to simulate the source/target domain shift in real-world scenarios. Then, a style-invariant UNet 3? base model is developed for accurate and robust sclera segmentation. To make the basemodel not only performwell on synthesized source domains but also on synthesized target domains, we employ the bilevel optimization strategy to update the base model, where three useful loss functions are contained. In the experiments, we build a cross-domain sclera segmentation (CDSS) dataset with diverse ethnicity and quality as domain labels to supplement the existing dataset. Besides, three protocols (cross-dataset, cross-ethnicity, and cross-quality) are designed for comprehensively evaluating the generalization of sclera segmentation models. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results validate the superiority of our method compared to several baselines, which indicates that MetaScleraSeg can learn the transferable knowledge across domains to generalize well on unseen target domains. Models and dataset of this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/lhqqq/MetaScleraSeg.

AB Traffic forecasting is significant for establishing intelligent traffic systems. However, the complex spatial-temporal relationships of traffic flow data make it challenging. Despite some studies investigating this problem, capturing complex spatial structures and learning the temporal dependence of the long-term prediction are still challenges that need to be addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based spatial-temporal graph transformer (ASTGT) model to solve the traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGT primarily consists of two independent components: temporal encoder and spatial-temporal decoder. Precisely, in temporal encoder, we capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data through the self-attention mechanism. The traffic flow data with long-term periodic dependence are also integrated. Moreover, spatial-temporal decoder superimposes the gated spatial graph convolution block to acquire both temporal and spatial relationships at the same time. Extensive experiments are conducted on PEMS04 and PEMS08 datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System. The results show that our proposed ASTGT model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

ID PHYSICS
AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) aim to learn well-trained representations in a lower-dimension space for downstream tasks while preserving the topological structures. In recent years, attention mechanism, which is brilliant in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision, is introduced to GNNs to adaptively select the discriminative features and automatically filter the noisy information. To the best of our knowledge, due to the fast-paced advances in this domain, a systematic overview of attention-based GNNs is still missing. To fill this gap, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on recent advances in attention-based GNNs. Firstly, we propose a novel two-level taxonomy for attention-based GNNs from the perspective of development history and architectural perspectives. Specifically, the upper level reveals the three developmental stages of attentionbased GNNs, including graph recurrent attention networks, graph attention networks, and graph transformers. The lower level focuses on various typical architectures of each stage. Secondly, we review these attention-based methods following the proposed taxonomy in detail and summarize the advantages and disadvantages of various models. A model characteristics table is also provided for a more comprehensive comparison. Thirdly, we share our thoughts on some open issues and future directions of attention-based GNNs. We hope this survey will provide researchers with an up-to-date reference regarding applications of attention-based GNNs. In addition, to cope with the rapid development in this field, we intend to share the relevant latest papers as an open resource at https://github.com/sunxi aobei/awesome-attention-based-gnns.

AB The wireless sensor network (WSN) coverage is one of the most significant impacts on the quality of service that directly determines the efficiency reality of applications. The distribution of sensor nodes in the WSN determines the size of the network monitoring coverage area, whether there is duplicate coverage, and monitoring blind regions. This study introduces an optimal coverage strategy for the sensor node positions in the sensing region based on an adapted transit search (ATS) algorithm. The transit search (TS) algorithm is a recently developed metaheuristic algorithm with several advantages, e.g. simple concept, robust process, and ease of implementation; still, TS has limitations in the ratios of exploration and exploitation for avoiding the local optimum trap when dealing with complicated node coverage optimization situations. The ATS is implemented by adapting and updating equations with stochastic reverse learning and multi-direction strategies to prevent its original algorithm drawbacks. The experimental analysis is carried out to demonstrate the efficiency of the designed coverage scheme in terms of various metrics, e.g. coverage rate, positioning errors, converge speed, and executed time. Compared experimental-result shows that the ATS scheme offers the WSN applicability coverage model to perform the deployment network application with excellent quality. Significantly, the coverage rate archived of the ATS is 87%, but the other methods are only below or equally 84% in the same comparison conditions.

AB Smart machining is becoming a major trend in the present manufacturing industry, which is increasingly adopting digital technology and artificial intelligence to improve production processes' quality, speed, efficiency, and safety. This condition leads to the presentation of an updated study regarding the application of the digital-twin virtual machining model development, to detect chatter phenomena in milling processes. Chatter is a dynamic interaction where an instability state is observed between the workpiece and the cutter during material removal. This process affects the roughness of the finish surface and tool-life and eventually reduces the machining results in quality. Consequently, a novel intelligent machining system was developed for detecting chatter based on the variational mode decomposition method, wavelet-based synchro-squeeze transform, and Transfer Learning (TL) application. This TL application was created using modified pre-trained convolution neural networks to identify unstable (chatter) or stable state conditions of the process of milling-cut. The model was also developed due to being data-driven, where the measured vibration signals for the process of milling-cut were trained and tested through several modified pre-trained networks. The results showed a good-level model with an average classification accuracy of 94.04%. Therefore, the manufacturing industry could adopt this novel method, especially in machining, to overcome the problem of emphasizing the limited process of data monitoring conditions.

TI A novel technique for multiple failure modes classification based on

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Deep forest; Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; Machine learning
ID ROCK
AB Deep learning is one of the emerging techniques that shows good failure modes classification prediction results due to its flexibility in recognizing patterns from raw sensor data. However, it requires complex hyperparameter optimization, high training time, and high computational hardware resources for neural network architecture. On the other hand, classical machine learning algorithms rely heavily on domain knowledge and manual feature engineering which is not always available in the industry. Therefore, we present an alternative method that learns characteristics of multivariate raw time series data to perform failure mode classification. The method is based on the deep forest algorithm, which is composed of two main processes: multi-grained scanning and cascade forest. The multi-grained scanning process windows the data and screens the times series to generate feature vectors automatically based on class probability distribution and hence recognize patterns from data. The cascade forest uses the output of the multi-grained scanning process and creates layers of random forests to make predictions. Each layer will perform fault classification, and the number of layers will increase until the accuracy of the classification does not improve. This layer-by-layer process is similar to deep learning, where the algorithm architecture is composed of different hidden layers. The presented methodology directly works with raw data in three domains: time, frequency, and time & frequency domain. Also, the method is validated using data provided by the Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) data challenge 2022 competition for hydraulic rock drill multiple failure mode classifications. The results show that the presented methodology is faster, less complex, and more accurate than deep learning algorithms.

AB In various official documents, the European Union has declared its goal to pursue a citizen-centric governance of digital transformation. Through a critical review of several of these documents, here we show how "citizen-centric" is more a glamouring than a driving concept. De facto, the EU is enabling a federated data system that is corporate-driven, economic-oriented, and GDPR-compliant; in other words, a Digital Single Market (DSM). This leaves out societal and collective-level dimensions of digital transformation-such as social inclusion, digital sovereignty, and environmental sustainability-which are acknowledged, but not operationalized, by the EU as pillars of a citizen-centric governance. Hence, the door is open to a complementary approach to the governance of digital transformation. We argue that, while a federated data model can constitute the tech-legal backbone of the emerging DSM, a commoning of data, as an ecosystemic approach that maintains a societal and collective outlook by default, can represent a complement to enact a truly citizen-centric governance.

AB Recently, lung cancer prediction based on imaging genomics has attracted great attention. However, such studies often have many challenges, such as small sample size, high-dimensional information redundancy, and the inefficiency of multimodal fusion. Therefore, in this paper, a deep convolution cascade attention fusion network (DCCAFN) based on imaging genomics is proposed for the prediction of lung cancer patients' survival. The network consists of three modules: an image feature extraction module (IFEM), a gene feature extraction module (GFEM), and an attention fusion network (AFN). In the IFEM, a pretrained residual network based on transfer learning is used to extract deep image features to fully capture the computed tomography (CT) image information conducive to prognosis prediction. In the GFEM, the F-test is first used for gene screening to eliminate redundant information, and then, a cascade network with the convolution cascade module (CCM) that contains a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and an ensemble forest classifier is designed to better extract the gene features. In the AFN, a bimodal attention fusion mechanism is proposed to fuse deep image features and gene features to improve the performance of predicting lung cancer survival. The experimental results show that the DCCAFN model achieves good performance, and its accuracy and AUC are 0.831 and 0.816, respectively. It indicates that the model is an effective multimodal data fusion method for predicting the survival prognosis of lung cancer, which can greatly help physicians stratify patients' risks, and achieve personalized treatment for improving the quality of patients' lives.

AB Cryptographic technology can effectively defend against malicious attackers to attack sensitive and private information. The core of cryptographic technology is cryptographic algorithm, and the cryptographic algorithm identification is the premise of in-depth analysis of cryptography. In the cryptanalysis of unknown cryptographic algorithm, the primary task is to identify the cryptographic algorithm used in the encryption and then carry out targeted analysis. With the rapid growth of Internet data, the increasing complexity of communication environment, and the increasing number of cryptographic algorithms, the single-layer identification scheme of cryptographic algorithm faces great challenges in terms of identification ability and stability. To solve these problems, on the basis of existing identification schemes, this paper proposes a new cluster division scheme CMSSBAM-cluster, and then proposes a multi-layer composite identification scheme of cryptographic algorithm using a composite structure. The scheme adopts the method of cluster division and single division to identify various cryptographic algorithms. Based on the idea of ensemble, the scheme uses the hybrid random forest and logistic regression (HRFLR) model for training, and conducts research on a data set consisting of 1700 ciphertext files encrypted by 17 cryptographic algorithms. In addition, two ensemble learning models, hybrid gradient boosting decision tree and logistic regression (HGBDTLR) model and hybrid k-neighbors and random forest (HKNNRF) model are used as controls to conduct controlled experiments in this paper. The experimental results show that multi-layer composite identification scheme of cryptographic algorithm based on HRFLR model has an accuracy rate close to 100% in the cluster division stage, and the identification results are higher than those of the other two models in both the cluster division and single division stages. In the last layer of cluster division, the identification accuracy of ECB and CBC encryption modes in block cryptosystem is significantly higher than that of the other two classification models by 35.2% and 36.1%. In single division, the identification accuracy is higher than HGBDTLR with a maximum of 9.8%, and higher than HKNNRF with a maximum of 7.5%. At the same time, the scheme proposed in this paper has significantly improved the identification effect compared with the single division identification accuracy of 17 cryptosystem directly and the 17 classification accuracy of 5.9% compared with random classification, which indicates that multi-layer composite identification scheme of cryptographic algorithm based on HRFLR model has significant advantages in the accuracy of identifying multiple cryptographic algorithms.

AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have become a common choice for industrial quality control, as well as other critical applications in the Industry 4.0. When these CNNs behave in ways unexpected to human users or developers, severe consequences can arise, such as economic losses or an increased risk to human life. Concept extraction techniques can be applied to increase the reliability and transparency of CNNs through generating global explanations for trained neural network models. The decisive features of image datasets in quality control often depend on the feature's scale; for example, the size of a hole or an edge. However, existing concept extraction methods do not correctly represent scale, which leads to problems interpreting these models as we show herein. To address this issue, we introduce the Scale-Preserving Automatic Concept Extraction (SPACE) algorithm, as a state-of-the-art alternative concept extraction technique for CNNs, focused on industrial applications. SPACE is specifically designed to overcome the aforementioned problems by avoiding scale changes throughout the concept extraction process. SPACE proposes an approach based on square slices of input images, which are selected and then tiled before being clustered into concepts. Our method provides explanations of the models' decision-making process in the form of human-understandable concepts. We evaluate SPACE on three image classification datasets in the context of industrial quality control. Through experimental results, we illustrate how SPACE outperforms other methods and provides actionable insights on the decision mechanisms of CNNs. Finally, code for the implementation of SPACE is provided.

AB Evolutionary multi-objective optimization is a field that has experienced a rapid growth in the last two decades. Although an important number of new multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been designed and implemented by the scientific community, the popular Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) remains as a widely used baseline for algorithm performance comparison purposes and applied to different engineering problems. Since every evolutionary algorithm needs several parameters to be set up in order to operate, parameter control constitutes a crucial task for obtaining an effective and efficient performance in its execution. However, despite the advancements in parameter control for evolutionary algorithms, NSGA-II has been mainly used in the literature with fine-tuned static parameters. This paper introduces a novel and computationally lightweight self-adaptation mechanism for controlling the distribution index parameter of the polynomial mutation operator usually employed by NSGA-II in particular and by multi-objective evolutionary algorithms in general. Additionally, the classical NSGA-II using polynomial mutation with a static distribution index is compared with this new version utilizing a self-adapted parameter. The experiments carried out over twenty-five benchmark problems show that the proposed modified NSGA-II with a self-adaptive mutator outperforms its static counterpart in more than 75% of the problems using three quality metrics (hypervolume, generalized spread, and modified inverted generational distance).

AB Decentralized behavior of entities in a green supply chain plays a significant role in pricing and green innovation effort to produce more environment-friendly products at affordable prices. Government intervention (e.g., subsidy for green production, Cap-and-Trade Policy (CTP)) is a crucial component for diminishing carbon emissions due to manufacturing of new products and recycling of used products. In this study, we investigate the long-term decentralized behavior of supply chain members and the evolutionary stable decision of the government to intervene in price and sales effort competition among retailers. More precisely, through an evolutionary game theoretic framework, we look for the non-cooperative behavior of the population of retailers investing in sales efforts towards the manufacturer who invests in green level of the products, under government intervention and CTP. The model is further extended to analyze the evolutionary behavior of the population of government whether it intervenes or not in the same situation. Our study demonstrates that the whole population of retailers adopts the retailer-led Stackelberg strategy to deal with the manufacturer, and the most significant finding is that, in such a situation, government intervention is always favorable regardless of what the supply chain decides. Numerical results exhibit that whenever retailers dominate the market, it becomes beneficial for both retailers as well as the entire supply chain, and the environmental performance of the product also increases compared to the vertical Nash scenario.

AB The hardware circuit of neural network based on forgetting memristors not only has the characteristics of high computational efficiency and low power consumption, but also has the advantage that a memristor can store the weight of long-term memory and short-term memory. Neural networks based on forgetting memristors can process two different data sets; however, the number of data sets processed is determined by the conversion rate of short-term memory to long-term memory neural network. In this paper, a forgetting memristor model with controllable decay rate is proposed, the short-term memory and long-term memory of the long-term and short-term memory (LSTM) network based on forgetting memristor is proposed, and the conversion speed from short-term memory network to long-term memory network is controllable. In the process of transformation from short-term memory to long-term memory of LSTM network based on forgetting memristor, the decay rate of forgetting memristor can be controlled, and the duration of short-term memory of LSTM network can be set. A reset signal mechanism is proposed so that the state of short-term memory of LSTM network with high recognition rate can be controlled. Based on the proposed controllable decay rate and reset signal, the state of the short-term memory network with high recognition rate can be set, so the LSTM network with two states can realize the recognition of different number of images under different data sets. Finally, two kinds of data sets are tested on the LSTM network based on the forgetting memristor, and the recognition rate is good, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB A classifier may be limited by its conditional misclassification rates more than its overall misclassification rate. In the case that one or more of the conditional misclassification rates are high, a neutral zone may be introduced to decrease and possibly balance the misclassification rates. In this paper, a neutral zone is incorporated into a three-class classifier with its region determined by controlling conditional misclassification rates. The neutral zone classifier is illustrated with a text mining application that classifies written comments associated with student evaluations of teaching.

AB While vacuum grippers offer an economical solution, the environmental impact of energy waste through their suction cups (SCs) cannot be overlooked. This waste stems from three key factors: i) air losses from idle SCs arranged in arrays, ii) inadequate sealing on target surfaces leading to air leaks, and iii) damage from sharp objects resulting in leaking perforations. To overcome these challenges, in this article, a comprehensive approach is presented that involves the development of a i) self-closing, ii) multi-material, and iii) self-healing system based on reversible elastomers cross-linked via the Diels-Alder (DA) reaction. The system incorporates a fully autonomous self-closing mechanism to prevent energy waste in SC arrays during periods of non-contact. Fluid-structure interaction simulations are utilized to analyze the design. Versatility and stability are achieved by incorporating hyper-flexible and stiff elastomers in a multi-material design, supported by covalent DA cross-links that ensure robustness through high-strength multi-material interfaces. These DA cross-links also enable self-healing capabilities, allowing the SCs to recover from macroscopic damages within 1 day at ambient conditions or in a single hour with mild heating (80-90 & DEG;C), restoring full performance. Additionally, in the article, a recycling method is introduced for multi-material SCs based on the mechanical separation of reversible polymers.

AB In this work, we explore multiplex graph (networks with different types of edges) generation with deep generative models. We discuss some of the challenges associated with multiplex graph generation that make it a more difficult problem than traditional graph generation. We propose TenGAN, the first neural network for multiplex graph generation, which greatly reduces the number of parameters required for multiplex graph generation. We also propose 3 different criteria for evaluating the quality of generated graphs: a graph-attribute-based, a classifier-based, and a tensor-based method. We evaluate its performance on 4 datasets and show that it generally performs better than other existing statistical multiplex graph generative models. We also adapt HGEN, an existing deep generative model for heterogeneous information networks, to work for multiplex graphs and show that our method generally performs better.

AB With the increasing accuracy and stability requirements of SMT equipment, automatic x-ray inspection (AXI) is used as a new popular type of testing technology. First, an imaging constraint model is proposed to ensure that the detected object is not truncated. Second, an improved iterative self-organizing clustering algorithm was proposed to realize an automatic optimal generation of the field of view and form a Hamiltonian path. Finally, the solution of the shortest Hamiltonian path problem is given by the proposed VTSP heuristic algorithm and VTSP + transformer deep learning algorithm. Experimental results show that, compared with the binary state compression DP method and the local shortest path planning method, the proposed method can support large-scale nodes, and the performance is improved by 16% on 75 nodes and 31% on 200 nodes. The proposed method achieves a balance between x-ray imaging efficiency and performance.

AB Machine learning provides powerful techniques for several applications, including automated disease diagnosis through medical image classification. Recently, many studies reported that deep learning approaches have demonstrated significant performance and accuracy improvements over shallow learning techniques. The deep learning approaches have been used in many problems related to disease diagnoses, such as thyroid diagnosis, diabetic retinopathy detection, foetal localization, and breast cancer detection. Many deep learning methods have been reported in the recent past that uses medical images from various sources, such as healthcare providers and open data initiatives, and reported significant improvement in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy. This paper proposes a framework incorporating deep convolutional neural networks and an enhanced feature extraction technique for classifying medical data. To show the real-world usability of the proposed approach, it has been used for the classification of COVID-19 images from computed tomography scans. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed some of the chosen baselines and obtained an accuracy of 98.91%, comparable with already reported accuracies.

AB Flexible grippers with superior gripping capabilities are essential for carrying objects. Herein, an origami chomper-based flexible gripper is designed using a combination of the origami technique and a newly developed nonlinear topology optimization method. This novel origami chomper-based flexible gripper exhibits superior gripping performance, as revealed by a series of experiments, including gripping range capability under an identical input load, maximum gripping ratio, gripping adaptability, and achieving richer gripping characteristics by size scaling. The origami chomper-based flexible gripper can handle a wide range of object irregularities in textures and uneven shapes and can enable effective gripping of objects across scales from millimeters to centimeters to decimeters through size scaling. This study paves the way for innovative high-performance designs of flexible grippers.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) has gained popularity in the field of computer vision such as video surveillance, security, and virtual reality. However, traditional methods are limited in terms of computations and holistic learning of human skeletal sequences. In this article, a new time-series skeleton joint data imaging method is infused into an improved convolutional neural network to handle these problems. First, the raw time-series data of 33 body nodes are transformed to red-green-blue images by encoding the 3D positional information to one pixel. Second, the LeNet-5 network is enhanced by expanding the receptive field, introducing coordinate attention and the smooth maximum unit to improve smoothness and feature extraction. Third, the ability of coded images to express human activities is studied in various environments. It is shown in the experimental results that the method achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.02% in recognizing 25 daily human activities, such as running, writing, and walking. In addition, it is shown that the number of floating point operations, parameters, and inference time of the method are 0.08%, 0.47%, and 3.05%, respectively, of the average values for six other networks (including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet). The proposed method is thus a novel, lightweight, and high-precision solution for HAR.

AB Speech-impaired people use Sign Language (SL), an efficient natural form of communication, all over the world. This paper aims to use deep learning technology in the realm of SL translation and identification. In order to ease communication between hearing-impaired and sighted individuals and to enable the social inclusion of hearing-impaired people in their daily lives, it presents a transformer as a neural machine translation model. The article details the creation of a machine translation system that converts Arabic audio and text into Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) automatically. It does this by utilizing an animated character to produce the correct sign for each spoken word. Since Arabic has few resources, it was challenging to obtain an Arabic-Sign dataset, so we created our own Arabic-Arabic sign gloss, which consists of 12,187 pairs, to train the model. We use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers as an embedding layer to interpret input text tokens and represent an appropriate natural language vector space for deep learning models. To represent the structure of each Arabic word, the Ferasa Part-of-Speech Tagging module was used and then the extracted rules from the ArSL structure were applied. This paper shows a detailed description of a natural language translator (for converting an Arabic word sequence into a sequence of signs belonging to the ArSL) and a 2D avatar animation module (for playing back the signs). In our prototype, we train the software-based module using the attention mechanism. The evaluation was carried out in our developed Arabic sentences with the corresponding Arabic gloss. The proposed model achieves promising results and indicates significant improvements to direct communication between hearing and deaf people, with a training accuracy of 94.71% and an 87.04% testing accuracy for Arabic-Arabic sign gloss translation.

AB The statistics pertaining to accidents occurring at construction sites underscore the pressing requirement for a substantial and timely reevaluation of safety measures within the construction sector. Accidents do not occur randomly; rather, they arise from the presence of unsafe actions, hazardous conditions, or a combination of both. The majority of accidents stem from a combination of contributing causes, including unsafe acts and conditions. To enhance safety performance on a broader scale, this study undertakes an extensive analysis to identify these causes, evaluate their importance, and determine the countries that are most and least impacted by them. Ten African countries were selected as potential alternatives based on the frequency of infrastructure construction projects. A thorough review of existing literature was conducted to establish a three-level criteria framework. The framework was further refined through the Modified Delphi method to gather expert opinions. The weights assigned to the criteria were determined using the interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy analytical hierarchy process methodology. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution method under the same fuzzy environment was then employed to rank the alternative countries. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess the robustness of the proposed methodology. The analysis revealed that the main cause of accidents was attributed to poor management, as it included ineffective project supervision, inadequate safety policies, poor organizational structure, and inappropriate scheduling/planning as the main underlying sub-factors. Additionally, it was observed that the sixth alternative country exhibited the highest susceptibility to accidents occurring at construction sites.

AB Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, has remained a severe issue for many years due to its increasing incidences. The rising mortality rate associated with melanoma demands immediate attention at early stages to facilitate timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Due to the similar visual appearance of malignant tumors and normal cells, the detection and classification of melanoma are considered to be one of the most challenging tasks. Detecting melanoma accurately and promptly is essential to diagnosis and treatment, which can contribute significantly to patient survival. A new dataset, Nailmelonma, is presented in this study in order to train and evaluate various deep learning models applying transfer learning for an indigenous nail melanoma localization dataset. Using the dermoscopic image datasets, seven CNN-based DL architectures (viz., VGG19, ResNet101, ResNet152V2, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and MobileNetv2) have been trained and tested for the classification of skin lesions for melanoma detection. The trained models have been validated, and key performance parameters (i.e., accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and F1-score) are systematically evaluated to test the performance of each transfer learning model. The results indicated that the proposed workflow could realize and achieve more than 95% accuracy. In addition, we show how the quantization of such models can enable them for memory-constrained mobile/edge devices. To facilitate an accurate, timely, and faster diagnosis of nail melanoma and to evaluate the early detection of other types of skin cancer, the proposed workflow can be readily applied and robust to the early detection of nail melanoma.

AB Close connections between probability theory and the theory of belief change emerge if the codomain of probability functions is extended from the real-valued interval [0, 1] to a hyperreal interval with the same limits. Full beliefs are identified as propositions with a probability at most infinitesimally smaller than 1. Full beliefs can then be given up, and changes in the set of full beliefs follow a pattern very close to that of AGM revision. In this contribution, iterated revision is investigated. The iterated changes in the set of full beliefs generated by repeated revisions of a hyperreal probability function can, semantically, be modelled with the same basic structure as the sphere models of belief change theory. The changes on the set of full beliefs induced by probability revision satisfy the Darwiche-Pearl postulates for iterated belief change.

AB Humans maintain and develop interrelationships through various forms of communication, including verbal and nonverbal communications. Gestures, which constitute one of the most significant forms of nonverbal communication, convey meaning through diverse forms and movements across cultures. In recent decades, research efforts aimed at providing more natural, human-centered means of interacting with computers have garnered increasing interest. Technological advancements in real-time, vision-based hand motion recognition have become progressively suitable for human-computer interaction, aided by computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. Consequently, we propose an effective system for recognizing hand gestures using time-of-flight (ToF) cameras. The hand gesture recognition system outlined in the proposed method incorporates hand shape analysis, as well as robust fingertip and palm center detection. Furthermore, depth sensors, such as ToF cameras, enhance finger detection and hand gesture recognition performance, even in dark or complex backgrounds. Hand shape recognition is performed by comparing newly recognized hand gestures with pre-trained models using a YOLO algorithm-based convolutional neural network. The proposed hand gesture recognition system is implemented in real-world virtual reality applications, and its performance is evaluated based on detection performance and recognition rate outputs. Two distinct gesture recognition datasets, each emphasizing different aspects, were employed. The analysis of results and associated parameters was conducted to evaluate the performance and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves competitive classification performance compared to conventional machine learning models evaluated on standard evaluation benchmarks.

AB In recent years, data privacy preservation has received increased attention in artificial intelligence. Federated learning, as a paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning, can considerably reduce the risk of privacy leakage by training models on local data. In federated learning, however, the clients and server must interact twice in each round of federated training, consuming abundant communication resources. To address the above issue, this work proposes an enhanced compressed sensing federated learning algorithm, which compresses and reconstructs the local network models trained on the clients using compressed sensing. To enhance the accuracy of the reconstructed models, we optimize the measurement matrix in compressed sensing using a genetic algorithm. In addition, we suggest an interleaving training and reconstruction method to improve the learning performance of the compressed models. Through a large number of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of maintaining high learning accuracy while accomplishing a large compression ratio for deep network models in federated learning. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK
AB Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods for multi-focus image fusion have achieved adequate performance. However, most of them cannot obtain spatially continuous results, especially in smooth regions and edges between focused and defocused regions. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end method, which merits both Transformers and CNNs, as a strong alternative for multi-focus image fusion task. Transformer has advantages over a CNN in that it can extract global features. It is able to make the fusion results to be spatially consistent. The proposed architecture consists of CNN and transformer branches, where transformer branches take feature map patches as inputs and leverages the transformer to propagate global contexts among patches. Moreover, in order to improve feature representation, we introduce online knowledge distillation learning strategy (KDL). The strategy achieves better interactions between global features and local features. Specifically, we design hard target and soft target by simply yet effectively ensembling outputs of two branches, which are used to supervise CNN and transformer branches. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture and achieve competitive results with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Data augmentation is a commonly used approach for addressing the issue of limited data availability in machine learning. There are various methods available, including classical and modern techniques. However, when applying modern data augmentation methods, such as Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs), to a class specific data, the resulting data can exhibit structural discrepancies. This study explores a different use of GANs as a data augmentation method that solves this problem using the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in the MITBIH arrhythmia dataset as the example. We begin by examining the cluster structure of a specific class using tDistributed Stochastic Neighbor (t-SNE) method. Based on this cluster structure, we propose a new method for applying GANs to augment data for that class. We assess the effect of our method in a classification task using 1-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), One vs one classifier (Ovo), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest as the classifiers. The results demonstrate that our proposed method could lead to better classification performance if a specific class has distinct clusters when compared to normal use of GANs.

TI Refined Division Features Based on Transformer for Semantic Image

AB Transformer can build global relationships between pixels and enhance pixel representation. The existing methods only establish the context relationship from the whole image but will reduce the representation between the category areas. In addition, the existing methods based on the transformer self-attention do not combine the advantages of convolution and transformer, resulting in more calculation parameters of the model. In order to solve these two problems, this paper proposes to enhance the segmentation accuracy and performance by enhancing the relationship between image-level regions and the relationship between semantic level pixels. First, we design a refined division feature (RDF) module to enhance the channel representation and thus the same locale representation. Second, we design a transformer based on convolution (CTrans), which first computes the relationship between similar pixels and enhances the pixel representation. Then, the feature map is compressed and enriched to reduce the computational load of CTrans, and finally the relationship between pixels is established from a global perspective. We design a refined division feature module based on transformer for semantic image segmentation (RFT) model combining RDF and CTrans module. The experimental results show that the mIoU result of our method in Cityscapes test data set is 81.9%, and the model parameter is 64.6M, which is superior to other methods in terms of data. In addition, we conducted visualization experiments with Cityscapes and Pascal voc 2012 datasets with other methods, and the results showed that our method was superior to other methods.

AB This paper gives a fault-tolerant control scheme concerning with the optimal and near-optimal system performance for a class of nonlinear systems with time-varying actuator faults, time-varying disturbances, and identification errors of the neural network-based identifier. In this paper, the adaptive dynamic programming method is directly used to design the optimal sliding surface, so that the designer can design the target dynamics of the sliding mode in advance. In addition, the barrier function-based sliding-mode control is used to cope with the bounded but boundary-unknown estimation errors of the identifier, and the method ensures that the sliding-mode variable converges to the designer's predefined neighborhood of zero in finite time and the control gain is not overestimated. Specifically, first, by adaptive dynamic programming, near-optimal sliding surface is designed in the sense of the quadratic optimal criterion. Second, a neural network identifier is designed to model the lumped uncertainties including actuator faults and disturbances. Third, a barrier function-based adaptive sliding-mode control is used to cope with the identification errors of the neural network identifier and has no control gain overestimation, which can guarantee to confine the sliding variable to a predefined vicinity of the proposed sliding surface. For this system with faults and disturbances, it is shown that near-optimal property is achieved by this scheme, the chattering phenomenon is effectively suppressed, and the reconstruction error of the neural network identifier with unknown boundary is effectively handled by the adaptive sliding-mode control based on the barrier function. The proof of stability is given by Lyapunov's direct method and the effectiveness of this control scheme is verified by applying it to the spacecraft attitude system.

AB Aggregation operators (AOs) are utilized to overcome the effects of attributes under some specific degree of weight in the decision-making (DM) process. The AOs have a large capacity to deal with uncertain and unpredictable information in multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. The Hamy mean (HM) aggregation tools are well-known aggregation models, which are utilized to define correlation among different input arguments adequately. The intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) sets (IFS) can express unpredictable and vague information. The Aczel Alsina aggregation expressions are extensions of triangular norms. Recently, Aczel Alsina aggregation tools attained a lot of attentions from numerous research scholars. By inspiring the robustness and reliability of Aczel Alsina aggregation tools, we expose some appropriate operations of Aczel Alsina expressions under consideration of IF information. In this manuscript, we developed an intuitionistic fuzzy Aczel Alsina HM (IFAAHM) and an intuitionistic fuzzy Aczel Alsina weighted HM (IFAAWHM) operator. We also expressed the theory of Dual HM (DHM) tools and established a series of new approaches including intuitionistic fuzzy Aczel Alsina Dual HM (IFAADHM) and intuitionistic fuzzy Aczel Alsina weighted Dual HM (IFAAWDHM) operators. Some reliable characteristics and special cases of our derived approaches are also presented. The authors solved an application of a MADM technique under consideration of our derived approaches. To check the reliability and dependency of our derived mythologies, we gave an experimental case study to evaluate a desirable construction material based on some specific criteria of different Alternatives. To see the advantages and compatibility of our derived approaches, by comparing the results of existing approaches with the results of currently discussed AOs.

AB Silicon content of molten iron is an important indicator in the blast furnace ironmaking process. Accurate prediction of silicon content is very important for monitoring the operating condition of the blast furnace and the quality of the molten iron. However, accurate and effective online prediction of silicon content is a challenging task due to the complex and high-dimensional nonlinear relationship between silicon content and process variables. Therefore, a two-stage multiobjective evolutionary ensemble learning algorithm is proposed to achieve a high-accuracy and low-complexity prediction model using support vector machine (SVR) as the base learner. In the first stage, a non-dominated sorting differential evolution algorithm with dynamic resource allocation (DRA-NSDE) is proposed to generate a set of non-dominated solutions (SVRs) with the objectives of accuracy and complexity. In the second stage, a stacking method based on clustering and differential evolution (CDE-Stacking) is proposed to select base learners with better diversity and construct the ensemble model. The effectiveness of the proposed DRA-NSDE and CDE-Stacking strategies is verified through a series of numerical experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the rival methods on both the UCI benchmark data set and the actual blast furnace data set. In addition, the analysis of model complexity shows that the proposed model can achieve higher prediction accuracy with relatively low model complexity, which indicates that the algorithm is very suitable for the online prediction of silicon content in actual blast furnace ironmaking process.

AB Fuzzy rough set models are useful tools for dealing with fuzzy and real-valued data. They have been used in many real-world applications. In this paper, we investigate the fuzzy rough set model based on triangular norms and fuzzy implications. First, we extend some results in the published literature by removing the condition that is the continuity of triangular norms, and obtain more general conclusion about fuzzy upper approximation operators. Then, for the fuzzy neighborhood and the fuzzy lower approximation operator based on fuzzy implications, we investigate their characterization with each other. Finally, we establish the relationships between fuzzy rough sets and fuzzy topology. In this work, researches on the properties of fuzzy rough sets based on triangular norms which need not be continuous provide generalization results for fuzzy rough set theory from viewpoint of mathematics.

AB Classification model selection is a process of identifying a suitable model class for a given classification task on a dataset. Traditionally, model selection is based on cross-validation, meta-learning, and user preferences, which are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. The performance of any machine learning classification task depends on the choice of the model class, the learning algorithm, and the dataset's characteristics. Our work proposes a novel method for automatic classification model selection from a set of candidate model classes by determining the empirical model fitness for a dataset based only on its clustering indices. Clustering Indices measure the ability of a clustering algorithm to induce good-quality neighborhoods with similar data characteristics. We propose a regression task for a given model class, where the clustering indices of a given dataset form the features and the dependent variable represents the expected classification performance. We compute the dataset clustering indices and directly predict the expected classification performance using the learned regressor for each candidate model class to recommend a suitable model class for dataset classification. We evaluate our model selection method through cross-validation with 60 publicly available binary class datasets and show that our top3 model recommendation is accurate for over 45 of 60 datasets. We also propose an end-to-end Automated ML system for data classification based on our model selection method. We evaluate our end-to-end system against popular commercial and noncommercial Automated ML systems using a different collection of 25 public domain binary class datasets. We show that the proposed system outperforms other methods with an excellent average rank of 1.68.

TI A Deep Regression Approach for Human Activity Recognition Under Partial
   Occlusion
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Human activity recognition; occlusion; deep learning; regression
AB In real-life scenarios, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from video data is prone to occlusion of one or more body parts of the human subjects involved. Although it is common sense that the recognition of the majority of activities strongly depends on the motion of some body parts, which when occluded compromise the performance of recognition approaches, this problem is often underestimated in contemporary research works. Currently, training and evaluation is based on datasets that have been shot under laboratory (ideal) conditions, i.e. without any kind of occlusion. In this work, we propose an approach for HAR in the presence of partial occlusion, in cases wherein up to two body parts are involved. We assume that human motion is modeled using a set of 3D skeletal joints and also that occluded body parts remain occluded during the whole duration of the activity. We solve this problem using regression, performed by a novel deep Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN). Specifically, given a partially occluded skeleton, we attempt to reconstruct the missing information regarding the motion of its occluded part(s). We evaluate our approach using four publicly available human motion datasets. Our experimental results indicate a significant increase of performance, when compared to baseline approaches, wherein networks that have been trained using only nonoccluded or both occluded and nonoccluded samples are evaluated using occluded samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work that formulates and copes with the problem of HAR under occlusion as a regression task.

DE Crowd counting; density estimation; multi-scale fusion
ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; CROWD; MODEL
AB Because of the large-scale variation, counting in scenes of different densities is an extremely difficult task. In this paper, based on the attention mechanism, we propose a new self-weighted multi-scale fusion network structure named SMFNet to solve the problem of multi-scale changes and can significantly improve the effect of crowd counting in monitoring scene. The proposed SMFNet uses VGG as the backbone network to extract multi-scale features, uses a SMFNet as the neck to fuse multiple-scale features, and uses the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) network and ordinary convolution as the head to generate both the attention map and the density map. The attention map highlighting crowd regions in the image contributes to a high-quality density map, and the density map records the crowd distribution. The number of crowd in the image can be obtained by summing the pixel values of the density map. We conduct experiments on three crowd counting datasets and one vehicle counting dataset to show that our proposed SMFNet can improve the state-of-the-art counting methods.

AB From May 2019, GitHub launched sponsor mechanism indicating that GitHub is moving towards deeper integration of open source development and economic support. It will bring more comprehensive and diversified support to the open source community. However, the number of developers profiting from the sponsor mechanism follows a long tail distribution. Our study found that only 31% of developers who started the sponsor mechanism received rewards, and 39.3% of them only received a reward of one dollar.Our work focuses on identifying what factors affect the availability of sponsorship for developers in open source community. We start by defining 45 features to characterize the developers in four dimensions i.e. Personality, Advertisement, Repository and Behavior. The results of statistical analysis indicate that most of the proposed features differ significantly between the ones who received rewards (short for MTs_Yes) from those that are not. After that, we build machine learning model based on the proposed features to predict MTs_Yes. Compared with the existing work, results show that our method outperforms baselines by 30% for AUC (Area Under the Curve). In addition, we investigated the relative contribution of features in detecting MTs_Yes and analyzed the important features by using an interpretable model SHAP. Finally, based on the experimental results, we put forward corresponding and practical suggestions for developers who want to receive rewards so as to make the community of open source projects develop more harmonious.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Skin cancer, primarily resulting from the abnormal growth of skin cells, is among the most common cancer types. In recent decades, the incidence of skin cancer cases worldwide has risen significantly (one in every three newly diagnosed cancer cases is a skin cancer). Such an increase can be attributed to changes in our social and lifestyle habits coupled with devastating man-made alterations to the global ecosystem. Despite such a notable increase, diagnosis of skin cancer is still challenging, which becomes critical as its early detection is crucial for increasing the overall survival rate. This calls for advancements of innovative computer-aided systems to assist medical experts with their decision making. In this context, there has been a recent surge of interest in machine learning (ML), in particular, deep neural networks (DNNs), to provide complementary assistance to expert physicians. While DNNs have a high processing capacity far beyond that of human experts, their outputs are deterministic, i.e., providing estimates without prediction confidence. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop DNNs with uncertainty-awareness to provide confidence in their predictions. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) is vastly used for uncertainty quantification; however, MCD suffers from overconfidence and being miss calibrated. In this paper, we use MCD algorithm to develop an uncertainty-aware DNN that assigns high predictive entropy to erroneous predictions and enable the model to optimize the hyper-parameters during training, which leads to more accurate uncertainty quantification. We use two synthetic (two moons and blobs) and a real dataset (skin cancer) to validate our algorithm. Our experiments on these datasets prove effectiveness of our approach in quantifying reliable uncertainty. Our method achieved 85.65 & PLUSMN; 0.18 prediction accuracy, 83.03 & PLUSMN; 0.25 uncertainty accuracy, and 1.93 & PLUSMN; 0.3 expected calibration error outperforming vanilla MCD and MCD with loss enhanced based on predicted entropy.

DE Language agents; Existential risk; Reward misspecification; Goal
   misgeneralization; Interpretable AI
AB Recent advances in natural-language processing have given rise to a new kind of AI architecture: the language agent. By repeatedly calling an LLM to perform a variety of cognitive tasks, language agents are able to function autonomously to pursue goals specified in natural language and stored in a human-readable format. Because of their architecture, language agents exhibit behavior that is predictable according to the laws of folk psychology: they function as though they have desires and beliefs, and then make and update plans to pursue their desires given their beliefs. We argue that the rise of language agents significantly reduces the probability of an existential catastrophe due to loss of control over an AGI. This is because the probability of such an existential catastrophe is proportional to the difficulty of aligning AGI systems, and language agents significantly reduce that difficulty. In particular, language agents help to resolve three important issues related to aligning AIs: reward misspecification, goal misgeneralization, and uninterpretability.

AB If I decide to disclose information about myself, this act may undermine other people's ability to conceal information about them. Such dependencies are called privacy dependencies in the literature. Some say that privacy dependencies generate moral duties to avoid sharing information about oneself. If true, we argue, then it is sometimes justified for others to impose harm on the person sharing information to prevent them from doing so. In this paper, we first show how such conclusions arise. Next, we show that the existence of such a dependency between the moral significance you are inclined to attribute to privacy dependencies and judgments about permissible self-defense puts pressure on at least some ways of spelling out the idea that privacy dependencies ought to constrain our data-sharing conduct.

AB The capacity to interact with environments, understand them, and make judgments on time defines smartness, the foundation of smart cities, and civilizations. The main motivation of this study is to satisfy the need for a real-time disaster-related application that increases the demand for novel techniques that are scalable with big data. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the input data to find the crucial features and accurately classify them into their appropriate disaster class with the help of social media. The disaster dataset contains numerous features which increase the dimensionality of the dataset. The existing techniques consume higher runtime memory for large training datasets and suffered from different drawbacks such as oversampling, computational cost, low speed, data imbalance, concept drift, and computational complexity. To overcome these drawbacks, this study presents a novel city councils evolution (CCE)-optimized ensemble support vector machine-based extreme learning machine (ESVM-ELM) model on Apache Spark for predicting disaster events in big data. The traditional serial processing issue is overcome in this paper using an appropriate parallelization technique which improves the speedup of the model and improves the time taken for classification. The ESVM-ELM model performs well with imbalanced datasets and handles the concept drift problem efficiently. The use of the CCE algorithm for optimizing the ESVM-ELM model offers improved accuracy, a better convergence rate, and minimal computational complexity. The efficiency of our model is demonstrated by validation using the disaster tweets dataset and comparison with the four underlying approaches, namely, naive Bayes, ELM, FCM, and Log-Based Abnormal Task Detection. The cross-validation method is utilized in this paper to generate an ensemble of ELM classifiers for decision-making utilizing an ESVM-ELM algorithm. The proposed model offers improvements in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure values when compared to different baseline models. The experimental results demonstrated the efficiency of the ESVM-ELM model in improving the prediction accuracy, speedup, and scale-up for big data classification with reasonable processing time.

AB With the continued growth and popularity of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies there is a parallel growth in illegal mining to earn cryptocurrency. Since mining for cryptocurrencies requires high computational resource; malicious actors have resorted to using malicious file downloads and other methods to illegally use a victim's system to mine for cryptocurrency without them knowing. This process is known as host-based cryptojacking and is gradually becoming one of the most popular cyberthreats in recent years. There are some proposed traditional machine learning methods to detect host-based cryptojacking but only a few have proposed using deep-learning models for detection. This paper presents a novel approach, dubbed CryptoJackingModel. This approach is a deep-learning host-based cryptojacking detection model that will effectively detect evolving host-based cryptojacking techniques and reduce false positives and false negatives. The approach has an overall accuracy of 98% on a dataset of 129,380 samples and a low performance overhead making it highly scalable. This approach will be an improvement of current countermeasures for detecting, mitigating, and preventing cryptojacking.

AB One of the most critical infrastructures during the COVID-19 pandemic are intensive care units (ICU). ICU's crucial task is to preserve the lives of patients and mitigate the pandemic's impact on the population. However, most ICUs plan only one day ahead. This short-term planning becomes an obstacle during disaster situations since physicians need to decide efficiently and ensure the timely treatment of high-risk patients. Integrating machine learning (ML) systems for clinical decision support could improve this process by predicting the mortality risk of critically ill patients. Several ML approaches tackling this problem have already shown promising results. However, these systems mostly neglect the integration of explicit domain knowledge, which is crucial to ensure prediction quality and adaptability. Otherwise, black-box systems might base their decision on confounding variables and improper relationships. Following design science research, we utilize a unique dataset of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in ICU care to design a clinical decision support system by combining ML and expert knowledge in the form of a severity score. We show that by augmenting the system with expert knowledge, its overall performance improves compared to the baseline approach.

AB In India, agricultural production is a crucial factor for economic growth. However, plants can be attacked by diseases that range from mild to severe, leading to their destruction. Therefore, it is essential to detect plant diseases at an early stage to prevent such damage. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid Xception transfer learning with crossover optimized kernel extreme learning machine (HXTL-COKELM) method for identifying healthy and diseased plant leaves. The proposed approach preprocesses and extracts image features using transfer learning with the Xception model to improve computation accuracy before classification. Additionally, we developed a crossover-based tasmanian devil-optimized kernel extreme learning machine model to optimize the KELM's parameters using the TDO algorithm. We collected a dataset with 43,466 images of plant leaves from healthy and diseased plants to train, test, and validate the CNN model. Finally, we evaluated the system's efficacy using performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, specificity, F1-score, and kappa static value. Our experimental findings show that the proposed HXTL-COKELM method achieves a 98.9% accuracy rate, outperforming existing methods. The HXTL-COKELM model also exhibits superior overall performance. Thus, the proposed HXTL-COKELM model can effectively detect plant leaf diseases.

AB Constructing Bayesian network structures from data is an NP-hard problem. This paper presents a novel method for Bayesian network structure learning using a discrete Harris hawks optimization algorithm, named BNC-HHO. It uses the max-min parents and children algorithm, V-structure & log-likelihood function, and neighborhood structures to limit the search space during the initialization phase. Then, the Harris hawk optimization algorithm is extended from the continuous to the discrete domain by redefining the movement strategies of hawks using genetic operators in genetic algorithm. The crossover and mutation operations in the proposed method are controlled by an adaptive crossover and mutation rate based on the X-conditional cloud. To balance the exploration and exploitation phases, a nonlinear escaping energy curve is also designed. Finally, the quality of the solution is further improved using a local optimizer. Experiments on various standard networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can quickly get higher structure scores and better convergence accuracy in most cases compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. It indicates that the proposed algorithm can be used as an effective and feasible method for learning Bayesian network structures.

AB A differential evolution (DE) algorithm with superior-inferior mutation scheme (SIDE) is proposed to solve global optimization problems over continuous space. Firstly, a superior-inferior mutation scheme is introduced based on the superior individual and inferior individual. Secondly, the dynamic adjustment strategy of exploration factor for balancing superior individual and inferior individual is proposed, which indicates how much weight to place on local exploitation and global exploration. They are integrated to DE in different milestones of optimization to balance exploration and exploitation of the search space and can alleviate the premature convergence. In order to verify the performance of SIDE, a set of numerical experiments on 32 benchmark functions are executed for performance comparison with 8 advanced DE variants and 4 non-DE-based algorithms for 30, 50 and 100 variables. The experimental results indicate that SIDE is much better than compared DE algorithms in terms of optimization quality. Furthermore, SIDE has the best adaptability to high dimensional problems.

AB In large-scale multi-objective optimization problems (LSMOPs), multiple conflicting objectives and hundreds even thousands of decision variables are contained. Therefore, it is a great challenge to address LSMOPs due to the curse of dimensionality. To tackle LSMOPs, this paper proposes a resource allocation-based multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, decision variables are firstly divided into convergence-related variables and diversity-related variables by the proposed layer thickness-based variable classification (LTVC) method. Then, a resource allocation-based convergence optimization strategy is introduced for the convergence-related variables, which can allocate more computational resource to the sub-component with the best contribution. For the diversity-related variables, diversity optimization technique is adopted. Finally, the experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm has a competitive performance compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms.

ID DECISION-MAKING; BELIEF; FRAMEWORK
AB How to handle conflict in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is an open issue. Many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. The existing approaches can be divided into two kinds. The first is to improve the combination rule, and the second is to modify the data model. A typical method to improve combination rule is to assign the conflict to the total ignorance set T. However, it does not make full use of conflict information. A novel combination rule is proposed in this paper, which assigns the conflicting mass to the power set (ACTP). Compared with modifying data model, the advantage of the proposed method is the sequential fusion, which greatly decrease computational complexity. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, some numerical examples are given. Due to the less information loss, the proposed method is better than other methods in terms of identifying the correct evidence, the speed of convergence and computational complexity.

AB Fault diagnosis and detection in electrical power systems need a development of new and robust supervision structures. In the last years, different intelligent monitoring methods have been successfully proposed to deal with the problem of fault diagnosis in power transmission lines. In this work, a new hybrid strategy called FFT-FL combining Fuzzy Logic (FL) approach with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed and applied to fault diagnosis in power line network. The elaborated fault detection structure consists of indicating whether the electrical transmission is working correctly or a fault has occurred with an effective isolation step to determine the faulty zone in the line. Whereas, an identification step consists of determining faulty phase thus fault classification in the studied line network. The novel proposed algorithm (FFT-FL) is used to improve the fault diagnosis response time and to decouple between faults and disturbances. In this paper, a comparative study is presented between the two intelligent methods for detection, isolation and identification of faults using only FL and the hybrid FFT-FL structure. The obtained simulation results verify the effectiveness and the correctness of the proposed fault method for all types of faults in the power line networks and in different zones.

AB Image compression techniques realized in various ways have become an indispensable part in the practical storage and transmission of digital images. In this study, we present a novel method of lossy compression based on sampling and fuzzy encoding for grayscale images and discuss the problem of their reconstruction. First, an image is divided into a number of non-overlapping blocks of pixels. Next, we perform multiple rounds of random sampling. In each round, a number of pixels are selected as prototypes for the representing the corresponding block. Each pixel in the block is reconstructed based on the gray levels of the prototypes and membership degrees computed with respect to the distances of each pixel to the prototypes. The reconstruction abilities delivered by the prototypes are quantified by a certain objective fidelity criteria and the prototypes leading to lowest reconstruction error are determined as representatives of current block. Finally, once the representatives in each block have been determined, we reconstruct the whole image based on these prototypes. Experimental studies as well as visual evaluations show that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve high compression ratios while preserving the overall fidelity in the decompressed images.

AB The application of the double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic set (DHHFLTS) is frequently utilized for assessing and evaluating ecological environmental governance, addressing the complexities and uncertainties inherent in environmental decision-making.This paper proposes a double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic multi-attributive border approximation area method (DHHFL-MABAC) based on distance measure and synthetic weight, which facilitates a rational decision-making process for selecting the appropriate governance company within a complex decision environment. Initially, a double hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic distance measure based on least common multiple (DHHFLDM-LCME) based on the minimum common multiple is proposed to address the issue of language information loss in distance measurement calculations of DHHFLEs with varying lengths. Subsequently, the binary comparison method is introduced, and the comprehensive weight is derived by combining the entropy weight, followed by an analysis of its properties. Finally, the method is validated using a case study involving a sewage treatment enterprise, demonstrating its consideration for potential loss and its simplicity and stability in calculation.

DE Multi-view stereo; Deep learning; Uncertainty awareness; Adaptive
   propagation; Cost volume regularization
AB The learning-based multi-view stereo method predicts depth maps across various scales in a coarse-to-fine approach, effectively enhancing both the quality and efficiency of reconstruction. Addressing the challenge of obtaining adaptable deep refinement intervals and lightweight functionality within this technique, we propose uncertainty awareness with adaptive propagation for multi-view stereo (AP-UCSNet) as a solution. When sampling the depth hypothesis, we employ convolution operations to compute a set of neighboring points that are consistently located on the same physical surface for each pixel. We then weight and average the uncertainty awareness results for each pixel and all its neighbors to derive spatially related depth hypothesis samples, a process that mitigates the noise influence in some areas of weak texture. Furthermore, we extend the network to a four-scale structure to bolster its performance. The first three scales utilize the 3D UNet structure to regularize the cost volume, whereas for the final scale, the probability volume is constructed directly from the feature map to simplify the regularization process. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method delivers superior results and performance. In comparison to UCSNet, the completeness error and overall error are reduced by 0.051 mm and 0.021 mm, respectively. On the Quadro RTX 5000 GPU, predicting a depth map with a resolution of 1600 x 1184 only requires 0.57s and 4398 M, reflecting a decrease of approximately 19.7% and 34.2% respectively.

AB Traffic flow detection plays a significant part in freeway traffic surveillance systems. Currently, effective autonomous traffic analysis is a challenging task due to the complexity of traffic delays, despite the significant investment spent by authorities in monitoring and analysing traffic congestion. This study builds an intelligent analytic method based on machine-learning algorithms to investigate and predict road traffic flows in four locations in the United Kingdom (London, Yorkshire and the Humber, North East, and North West) with a range of relevant factors. While aiming to conduct the study, the dataset 'estimated annual average daily flows (AADFs) Data-major and minor roads' from the UK government was used. Machine-learning algorithms are used for this research and classification applied consists of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting. Each of these algorithms achieves an accuracy of over 93% and the F1 score of over 95%, with Random Forest outperforming the other algorithms. This analytical approach helps to focus attention on critical areas to reduce traffic flows on major and minor roads in the area. In summary, the findings on traffic analysis have been discussed in detail to demonstrate the practical insights of this study.

AB Data hiding in encrypted images (DHEI) can not only protect the content of the original image but also manage and control the encrypted image, which is important for protecting personal privacy and improving the efficiency of third-party data processing. However, the current DHEI algorithms still have room for progress in the embedding capacity. In this paper, a high-capacity DHEI algorithm based on compressive sensing and intra-block difference coding is proposed. The content-owner firstly utilizes the compressive sensing progressive reconstruction prediction method to obtain prediction error, then encodes the quantized prediction error and measurements, and finally gets the encrypted image by the stream cipher algorithm. The data-hider embeds secret data by bit substitution. The receiver executes the extraction of secret data or the recovery of the original image according to the possessed key. Experimental results show that our method achieves higher embedding capacity compared with other methods, and the reconstruction quality of the original image remains reliable at high embedding rate.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Automated Breast Ultrasound is a highly advanced breast tumor detection modality that produces hundreds of 2D slices in each scan. However, this large number of slices poses a significant burden for physicians to review. This paper proposes a novel 2.5D tumor detection model, named "ABUSDet," to assist physicians in automatically reviewing ABUS images and predicting the locations of breast tumors in images. At the core of this approach, a sequence of data blocks partitioned from a pre-processed 3D volume are fed to a 2.5D tumor detection model, which outputs a sequence of 2D tumor candidates. An aggregation module then clusters the 2D tumor candidates to produce the ultimate 3D coordinates of the tumors. To further improve the accuracy of the model, a novel mechanism for training deep learning models, called "Deliberate Training," is proposed. The proposed model is trained and tested on a dataset of 87 patients with 235 ABUS volumes. It achieves sensitivities of 77.94%, 75.49%, and 65.19% at FPs/volume of 3, 2, and 1, respectively. Compared with the 2D and 3D object detection models, the proposed ABUSDet model achieves the highest sensitivity with relatively low false-positive rates.

AB Decentralized multi-robot systems typically perform coordinated motion planning by constantly broadcasting their intentions to avoid collisions. However, the risk of collision between robots varies as they move and communication may not always be needed. This paper presents an efficient communication method that addresses the problem of "when" and "with whom" to communicate in multi-robot collision avoidance scenarios. In this approach, each robot learns to reason about other robots' states and considers the risk of future collisions before asking for the trajectory plans of other robots. We introduce a new neural architecture for the learned communication policy which allows our method to be scalable. We evaluate and verify the proposed communication strategy in simulation with up to twelve quadrotors, and present results on the zero-shot generalization/robustness capabilities of the policy in different scenarios. We demonstrate that our policy (learned in a simulated environment) can be successfully transferred to real robots.

AB Most existing network embedding based anomalous link detection methods regard network embedding and anomalous link detection as two independent tasks. However, removing anomalous links from the original network can reduce the data noise, thus hopefully improving the performance of network embedding models and anomalous link detection. In this paper, we propose an Anomaly Aware Network Embedding (AANE) framework by simultaneously learning node embedding and detecting anomalous links in a unified way. To instantiate the AANE framework, we propose a heuristic anomalous link selection based model AANE-H and an embedding disentangling based model AANE-D on Graph Auto-Encoder (GAE). In AANE-H, we adopt an anomalous link selector to iteratively select significant anomalous links based on a heuristic rule during model training, while in AANE-D the normal and anomalous links are generated by disentangled normal and anomalous embedding respectively. For the evaluation purpose, we propose a heuristic anomalous link generation algorithm to inject synthetic anomalous links into six real-world network datasets used in our experiments. Experimental results show that AANE outperforms both the state-of-the-art network embedding models and anomalous node detection models in terms of anomalous link detection performance. As a general network embedding model, AANE can also improve other downstream tasks like node classification.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB Recently, deep neural networks have been adopted in many application domains showing impressive performances that sometimes even exceed those of humans. However, the considerable size of deep learning models and their computational cost limits their use in mobile and embedded systems. Pruning is an important technique that has been used in the literature to compress a trained model by removing some of its elements (weights, neurons, filters, etc.) that do not notably contribute to its performance. In this paper, we propose a new block pruning method for residual networks that removes holes layers of the network based on the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework. The proposed method takes advantage of the existence of multiple trainable paths in residual models to identify and prune the less important residual blocks for inference. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using three different MAB algorithms, namely $\varepsilon $e-greedy, Win Stay Lose Shift (WSLS), and the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). The obtained results on different datasets show that our block pruning method can considerably reduce the model size and FLOPs with little to no impact on overall accuracy. We conducted a comparative analysis of our method with three existing techniques to demonstrate that our approach is highly competitive in terms of accuracy, while significantly reducing both model size and FLOPs. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that when our block pruning method is combined with a filter-level pruning technique, it leads to even greater reductions in model size and FLOPs while maintaining a relatively high accuracy.

AB The neural machine translation (NMT), which relies on a large training data (bilingual parallel sentences, for NMT) to obtain the state-of-the-art performance, is similar with deep learning. In order to construct NMT systems, the number of parallel sentences is very important. However, these bilingual resources are scarce for many low-resource language pairs. Although several works attempt to obtain bilingual parallel data from Internet, the quality and quantity of mined bilingual corpus are limited for low-resource language pairs. To address this problem, we propose the multi-view knowledge distillation model (MvKD) that use the knowledge of high-resource language pairs transfer into low-resource languages by leveraging internal language invariant in different languages. In particular, we treat the mining bilingual parallel sentence pair task as classifying task and use the multi-view classifier to detect bilingual parallel sentence pair. For multi-view classifier, we use two views to recognize the semantic difference of two sentences: (i) word-level representations and (ii) sentence-level representations. We encode sentence-level representations to capture semantically similar of two sentences. Moreover, we encode word-level representations to capture word translations in a pair of parallel sentences to avoid the problem that semantically similar but non-parallel sentences. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly mine amount of bilingual corpus and improve the quality of parallel sentences. In particular, we carry out the experiments on several real-world low-resource situations and achieve excellent results.

AB The most critical issue for financial and entrepreneurship institutions is determining customers' ability to repay the facilities. Furthermore, the customers' success in running and fulfilling their business should be considered. A wide range of research studies has been carried out on customers' authentication about granting personal credit cards and consumer loans to them. The issue that has remained untouched or less investigated is that most loans paid for starting up a business encounter the problem of not setting up that business; moreover, applicants may fail to maintain their business after launch. These issues can result in several issues such as inflation in society, non-growth of assets and stalled transactions, and huge losses for loan lending institutions. One appropriate solution to overcome such problems is to select proper applicants for granting facilities with minimum failure probability for project fulfillment or facility non-repayment. From this standpoint, the present study presents a decision-making model for the automatic selection of facility applicants which is a critical need in financial institutions. For this purpose, a relatively comprehensive and complete dataset based on existing standards is generated. This dataset is designed by considering the patterns of prosperous and non-prosperous customers in four areas of prediction: supervision status, facility status, number of generated jobs, and activity time duration. A deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) model is designed and developed to extract features from input data. The proposed DFNN model is tested and investigated not only on the generated dataset, but also on other datasets, and it is then compared to other methods available. It is observed that the proposed model is significantly successful and efficient.

AB Nowadays, the problem of university graduates being unemployed is gradually increasing. To keep down unemployment, universities are integrating the concept of "applied education" into their educational curricula. The concept of applied education brings with it the problem of the correct student-company matching. In this study, the company selection criteria were focused on to determine the companies that university students will be sent to within the scope of applied education. Company selection criteria are determined by experts in the field. However, the evaluation of experts with precise criteria values can be very challenging in the decision-making process. For this purpose, the criteria weights were calculated using the Pythagorean Fuzzy AHP method in this study. Evaluation of companies to which students will be matched for applied/workplace education is ranked with these fuzzy weights by using TOPSIS and PROMETHEE II methods. To evaluation the proposed decision process, a real case study is carried out in an industrial private university in Turkey. The case study results show that the proposed method can provide effective and consistent results in the evaluation of companies under fuzzy environment.

AB This paper proposed an ensemble methodology comprising neural networks, modified differential evolution algorithm and nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) (called neuro-evolutionary NARX or NE-NARX model) for time series forecasting. In NE-NARX, the structure is designed by connecting the neural model and NARX model, and the weight value connection is optimized by a modified differential evolution algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed NE-NARX model is tested on two well-known benchmark datasets, including the Canadian lynx and the Wolf sunspot. The proposed model is compared to other models, including the classical backpropagation algorithm, particle swarm optimization, differential evolution (DE) and DE variants. Additionally, an ARIMA model is employed as the benchmark for evaluating the capacity of the proposed model. And then, NE-NARX model is used for hourly energy consumption prediction through comparison with other machine learning models including gated recurrent units, convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), a hybrid CNN-LSTM and sequence-to-sequence learning. Results show convincingly the superiority of the proposed NE-NARX model over other models.

AB The development of bio-inspired aquatic robots for underwater operations and scientific research has dramatically improved over the past decades. Dynamic modelling of such robots relies on the reactive force produced through the physical movement of their body parts. It is highly complex to capture the complete hydrodynamics for defining the reactive force, making the modelling and control of robotic fish challenging. This paper captures the hydrodynamic parameters from real-time data using a grey-box model structure optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA). The GA-optimized model aligns with real-time experimentation, exhibiting an average mean square error of approximately 0.001 m(2) across six swimming speeds. Next, GA optimization is proposed for designing the fuzzy logic controller to control the speed of the robotic fish. GA adjusts the parameters of the membership function and minimizes the error function. Finally, the controller's performance is compared with the classical GA-tuned PID (GAPID) and conventional fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The proposed controller has significant improvement in terms of tracking error, integral square error (ISE), integral absolute error and integral time absolute error. The optimized controller has achieved an ISE improvement of 84.64% and 87.15% compared to FLC and GAPID controllers, respectively.

AB This article concentrates on the data-driven containment problem for a class of nonlinear discrete-time multiagent systems via reinforcement learning. A novel two-layer control architecture is designed. In the first layer, a reference model is introduced with which all signals of the multiagent systems will reach synchronization. On account of the critic-actor neural network architecture, an adaptive neural network controller with a multigradient recursive reinforcement learning algorithm and less learning parameters method is designed to tackle the tracking issues and actuator faults. Then in the distributed control layer, the virtual containment control input is developed via policy iteration with critic-actor neural networks such that the containment error will converge to a small neighborhood of the origin. Note that the proposed method makes the solution of optimal containment control problem independent of system dynamics and takes energy costs into consideration. Besides, the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded property of signals in the closed-loop system and the policy iteration convergence are guaranteed. Finally, some numerical illustrations are attached to consolidate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism.

AB Automated retinal blood vessel segmentation in fundus images provides important evidence to ophthalmologists in coping with prevalent ocular diseases in an efficient and non-invasive way. However, segmenting blood vessels in fundus images is a challenging task, due to the high variety in scale and appearance of blood vessels and the high similarity in visual features between the lesions and retinal vascular. Inspired by the way that the visual cortex adaptively responds to the type of stimulus, we propose a Stimulus-Guided Adaptive Transformer Network (SGAT-Net) for accurate retinal blood vessel segmentation. It entails a Stimulus-Guided Adaptive Module (SGA-Module) that can extract local-global compound features based on inductive bias and self-attention mechanism. Alongside a light-weight residual encoder (ResEncoder) structure capturing the relevant details of appearance, a Stimulus-Guided Adaptive Pooling Transformer (SGAP-Former) is introduced to reweight the maximum and average pooling to enrich the contextual embedding representation while suppressing the redundant information. Moreover, a Stimulus-Guided Adaptive Feature Fusion (SGAFF) module is designed to adaptively emphasize the local details and global context and fuse them in the latent space to adjust the receptive field (RF) based on the task. The evaluation is implemented on the largest fundus image dataset (FIVES) and three popular retinal image datasets (DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1). Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a competitive performance over the other existing method, with a clear advantage in avoiding errors that commonly happen in areas with highly similar visual features.

AB Providing personalized behavioral information as feedback to drivers can lead to safer practices. However, feedback efficacy is likely moderated by the driver's level of motivation towards behavioral change. Gamification of feedback, which is the incorporation of game design elements intended to motivate drivers toward safe behaviors, could potentially reduce unsafe behaviors in the long term. This article assesses a gamified driver feedback design in mitigating driver distraction and enhancing driving performance among younger drivers. A driving simulator study was conducted with 42 drivers, 21-30 years old, comparing: 1) no feedback; 2) real-time feedback; 3) real-time feedback + postdrive feedback; and 4) real-time feedback + postdrive feedback + game design elements to examine their impact on distraction engagement (manual-visual interactions with an in-vehicle display) and driving performance. Groups that received postdrive feedback, both with and without gamification elements, showed reduced distraction engagement and enhanced driving performance compared to no feedback. Between the two types of postdrive feedback, the nongamified feedback provided more benefits in reducing the 95th percentile glance duration to the in-vehicle display, and the one with gamification provided more benefits in reducing the rate of manual interactions with the in-vehicle display. Meanwhile, no benefits were observed with the real-time feedback only condition over no feedback. Despite minor differences in efficacy, both postdrive and gamification feedback appear to be effective countermeasures for distracted driving in the short term. Future research should investigate other game designs for driver feedback and assess the impact of feedback gamification over longer-term exposure.

AB The Internet of thing (IoT) is a global platform for connecting intelligent objects over the Internet. It facilitates the integration of the "supply chain (SC)"and "information and communication technology (ICT)"infrastructures inside a company and with its vendors and clients. The "supply chain management (SCM)"is presently required if a firm wishes to keep up with the rapid evolution of its consumers' needs. Several research has demonstrated that manufacturing companies must expedite the transition of their attention to sustainable development and the application of innovative technologies, such as IoT, in order to achieve their organizational objectives most efficiently. This study intends to examine the IoT's applicability in SCM and assess the most popular IoT systems. The difficulty of identifying the best suitable IoT system is dependent on a multitude of variables, which are sometimes stated as incomplete and unreliable estimations. In order to reach an outcome, this paper proposes a multi-criteria paradigm for IoT solution selection in a single-valued neutrosophic environment. Single-valued neutrosophic set (SiVNS) is a strong model to address uncertain information in terms of three membership functions, namely indeterminacy, truthfulness, and falsity. The goal of this study is to introduce some dynamic single-valued neutrosophic aggregation operators (AOs) for multi period decision-making problems that involve uncertain single-valued neutrosophic information. We develop novel Einstein AOs named as "dynamic single-valued neutrosophic Einstein weighted averaging (DSiVNEWA) operator and dynamic single-valued neutrosophic Einstein weighted geometric (DSiVNEWG) operator". Several characteristics of the suggested AOs are investigated. Additionally, we develop a multi-stage dynamic decision analysis utilizing ideal solutions. To illustrate the proposed technique, a numerical example is presented. Comparison and authenticity analyses are conducted to ascertain the efficacy and superiority of the suggested multi-stage dynamic decision analysis in the practical situation.

AB In a complex transaction and operation environment, supply chain usually faces the disruption risk, espe-cially the supplier selection. Fortunately, the blockchain technology not only can provide traceability and decentration for supply chain management, but also can increase supply chain resilience. With the aid of blockchain technology, this paper deeply proposes a two-stage performance measure model to assess suppliers reinforcing supply chain resilience. Firstly, we screen out the assessment criteria of supply chain and blockchain by using complex network. Subsequently, for depicting the hesitation of multiple experts, we formulate the generation mechanism of linguistic distribution. Besides, in the blockchain technology-enabled supply chain, the criteria of supply chain and blockchain are interactive. Therefore, considering the interactive criterion, we combine the PROMETHEE method with the internal interactive index to measure supplier performance in the first stage. Meanwhile, the robustness PROMETHEE method is further improved by designing three types of aggregation models. In the second stage, we also concern the supply chain situation before adopting blockchain technology. In this case, this paper further designs a correction method of supplier performance measure based on supplier historical information in order to select the reliable supplier. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed method. In general, this study enriches the evaluation criteria of supplier performance measure by considering the influence of blockchain technology and provides the correspond decision support for blockchain technology-enabled supply chain management.

AB In order to overcome the problems that the feature representation and classification effect of the existing methods need to be improved in complex contexts, this paper presents a novel few-shot relation extraction approach via the entity feature enhancement and attention-based prototypical network. The proposed model uses the pretrained RoBERTa model as the encoder while using the BiLSTM module for directional feature extraction. We further incorporate the entity feature enhancement module to improve the feature representation ability of the model. At last, the attention-based prototypical network is used to predict relations. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only outperforms the baseline models on the datasets from the bridge inspection and health domains but also achieves competitive results on the FewRel dataset in the general domain.

AB In recent years, neural networks have made pioneering achievements in the field of medical imaging. In particular, deep neural networks based on U-shaped structures are widely used in different medical image segmentation tasks. In order to improve the early diagnosis and clinical decision-making system of lung diseases, it has become a key step to use the neural network for lung segmentation to assist in positioning and observing the shape. There is still the problem of low precision. For the sake of achieving better segmentation accuracy, an optimized pure Transformer U-shaped segmentation is proposed in this article. The optimization segmentation network adopts the method of adding skip connections and performing special splicing processing, which reduces the information loss in the encoding process and increases the information in the decoding process, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the segmentation accuracy. The final experiment shows that our improved network achieves 97.86% accuracy in segmentation of the "Chest Xray Masks and Labels" dataset, which is better than the full convolutional network or the combination of Transformer and convolution.

AB This article proposes a methodology that uses machine learning algorithms to extract actions from structured chemical synthesis procedures, thereby bridging the gap between chemistry and natural language processing. The proposed pipeline combines ML algorithms and scripts to extract relevant data from USPTO and EPO patents, which helps transform experimental procedures into structured actions. This pipeline includes two primary tasks: classifying patent paragraphs to select chemical procedures and converting chemical procedure sentences into a structured, simplified format. We employ artificial neural networks such as long short-term memory, bidirectional LSTMs, transformers, and fine-tuned T5. Our results show that the bidirectional LSTM classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 0.939 in the first task, while the Transformer model attained the highest BLEU score of 0.951 in the second task. The developed pipeline enables the creation of a dataset of chemical reactions and their procedures in a structured format, facilitating the application of AI-based approaches to streamline synthetic pathways, predict reaction outcomes, and optimize experimental conditions. Furthermore, the developed pipeline allows for creating a structured dataset of chemical reactions and procedures, making it easier for researchers to access and utilize the valuable information in synthesis procedures.

AB Accurately predicting the performance in various sports is crucial in comprehending training characteristics and enhancing physical education and training processes. The increasing significance of sports in China has enhanced the interest for developing prediction models to assess athletes' sports performance, accurately. These models will greatly contribute to improving sports performance and implementing scientific training methods. This paper proposes a prediction model for athletes' sports performance using Neural Networks as the underlying framework. This research aims to enhance sports performance and scientific training by developing a reliable and effective prediction model.

AB Due to increasingly global cultural exchanges, people are more conscious about the importance of mastering a foreign language. Language translation and helping students in the colleges with their learning abilities to master one or more languages using computer-aided translation and training system has become an important research. Intelligibility is one of the most important indicators for translation evaluation of Chinese language spoken by English learners, but there is a big gap between the automatic translation intelligibility score and the human expert score. Based on this concept, this paper addresses the existing challenges faced by translation detection software to analyze their limitations and characteristics, especially related to learners' Chinese translation experience. To enhance translation recognition accuracy, we employ a data mining approach to identify imaging factors associated with incorrect translation by college students. First, we develop a data mining recognition and detection method, leading to improved accuracy in translation recognition by utilizing association specification and classification. The classifier is then utilized to distinguish various types of translation errors, while also incorporating a translation intelligibility evaluation to provide error correction feedback to learners. The proposed model outperforms standard translation methods and alternative approaches, achieving impressive identification accuracy (94.58%), efficiency (88.12%), and a low missed detection rate (5.32%). Moreover, it significantly reduces the translation mistakes, including grammatical (5.21%), semantic (3.45%), and contextual (2.18%) errors. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier outshines artificial neural network (ANN) classification in error detection, and the suggested scoring system demonstrates its superiority with the highest average correlation coefficient (0.822) compared to expert scoring. Experimental results confirm the improved accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed translation recognition and detection method.

AB The basic salp swarm algorithm (SSA) is a novel nature-inspired swarm intelligence optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of salp individuals in the deep sea. Since its development, the salp swarm algorithm has attracted widespread interest from scholars both at home and abroad for solving complex real-world practical problems. With continuous research, the SSA algorithm has revealed some shortcomings such as slow convergence speed and low accuracy. To enhance the optimization capability of the algorithm, in this paper, we propose an improved hybrid algorithm called TLSSA based on two phases of the teaching-learning-based optimization method: the teaching phase and the learner phase. In the teaching phase, students' ability is improved by updating the difference between the teacher and the class average level, which helps to improve the overall learning ability of the salp population, resulting in higher quality solutions. In the learning phase, by simulating the discussion, statement, and communication between students, the average level of the individual is improved, and the global search speed of the algorithm is accelerated. To verify the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed method, it is first tested on 30 IEEE CEC 2017 benchmark functions. The test results demonstrate that the proposed TLSSA method obtains better overall performance compared to 8 mainstream meta-heuristics and 8 advanced algorithms. After that, we applied the proposed method to solve two classical real-world engineering design problems and feature selection. Again, the experimental results show that our method has significant advantages over the traditional methods in solving these practical problems. The remarkable performance of our proposed improved TLSSA algorithm in solving theoretical and practical complex optimization problems also provides potential possibilities for applying more intelligent optimization algorithms to solve complex optimization problems in real-life situations in the future.

Thus, the objective of this paper is to propose a automated hyperparameter tuning approach for crack image classification. For this, a public dataset with 40,000 images of walls and floors of several buildings was used. The images are divided into two classes: negative (non-crack) and positive (crack). In this aspect, statistical methods are used for hyperparameter tuning, such as analysis of variance, Scott-Knott method and HyperTuningSK algorithm. Moreover, three new automated machine learning algorithms are proposed: AutoHyperTuningSK, AutoHyperTuningSK-test and AutoHyperTu-ningSK-DA. CNN architecture from the literature (MobileNet) and three types of hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer and data augmentation) are analyzed. In general, the recommended configurations reached the best results in relation to unselected hyperparameters. In this regard, a selected combinations achieved a mean accuracy of around 99% (test experiments) in binary crack classification.

AB Granular computing, an attractive branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on constructing, processing and communicating information granules. Although various useful structures involving fuzzy sets, rough sets and their extensions have been discussed in relation to this literature, there is still a research gap regarding the connections between hesitant fuzzy sets and rough sets. In response to this, we lay a preliminary foundation for two kinds of new rough structures induced by hesitant fuzzy sets. Using hesitant fuzzy information, we put forward one lower approximation, and two related upper approximations, for every crisp subset of the universe of discourse. We investigate the fundamental properties of the generalized rough structures produced from these approximations. We also reveal their connections with granular structures defined from binary relations: under very mild cardinality restrictions, both Pawlak's classical model and its extension to preordered-based approximations become particular cases of the new structures. In this framework, we introduce and investigate the notion of equivalent behavior toward granularity that can occur in various forms (when different hesitant fuzzy approximation spaces produce either the same upper or lower approximation, or the same collection of definable subsets). We describe an elegant mechanism which can be utilized to generate equivalent hesitant fuzzy approximation spaces in every possible way. Finally, these theoretical achievements are supported by a real-world application example dealing with life cycle assessment.

AB Graph theory is a developing field which has many advancements and developments in real-life applications. Although graph theory has rapid growth in modeling real-life issues, some vague details in real-life problems are hard to picture using the usual graph. Fuzzy graph theory is known for its applications in modeling the human thinking, which has the same structure as graph theory. The concept of fuzzy graphs extended to Pythagorean fuzzy sets depends on real-time situations. The purpose of interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic sets through which the values of the degree (membership, non-membership and neutral) can be taken from the intervals instead of the numbers so that it provides more adequate information about the uncertainty than traditional sets. This motivates us to introduce interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic sets in applications. The proposed investigation also leads to study the interval-valued Pythagorean neutrosophic graphs (IVPNGs) and their arithmetic operations. In addition, the concept of regular, strong, product, support strong, effective balanced IVPNGs are introduced for aggregating the IVPNGs information and analysed with suitable examples. Further, a methodology for successful curriculum design is examined to illuminate the adequacy and feasibility of the developed IVPNG.

AB Nowadays, attention to the goals of cost, quality, time, and risk is essential in every project. In this regard, the beneficiaries of each project seek to reduce the cost, time, and risk and increase the quality of the project simultaneously. As cost, risk, time, and quality are critical factors in project management, this study primarily focused on examining the trade-offs among these criteria to determine how increased costs and decreased risks can lead to reduced project implementation time and improved quality. To this end, in this research, a mathematical programming approach and metaheuristic algorithms have been suggested for PERT networks. The model is developed through a simulation process, and then the values of decision and response variables are obtained in each implementation. Finally, an artificial neural network model is designed, and several sample problems are generated on small, medium, and large scales to solve the model. This study has several contributions, including the development of a mathematical programming model for PERT networks that considers the cost-risk-time-quality trade-off. Additionally, an artificial neural network model is proposed for solving problems of various sizes. At the same time, NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms are utilized to handle NP-hard problems in the mathematical programming of PERT networks. Furthermore, the model considers multi-dimensional activities, with cost, quality, risk, and time as the four objective functions in the PERT network. Finally, AHP-TOPSIS methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of NSGA-II and MOPSO algorithms. The findings illustrated that the NSGA-II algorithm performed better than the MOPSO algorithm in all three designed problems. The proposed model became practical and closer to reality than the previous models by eliminating unrealistic assumptions.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB The study of renewable energy is expanding quickly, particularly in the areas of modeling and photovoltaic (PV) technology. The utilization of photovoltaic systems is prevalent in diverse renewable energy applications. The primary concern of photovoltaic systems is the optimization of output power to achieve maximum efficiency. Consequently, numerous investigations are being conducted to model photovoltaic systems with the aim of enhancing the power output. The process of maximizing power output on photovoltaic systems is commonly referred to as maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The implementation of MPPT methods is a crucial aspect of photovoltaic system engineering, aimed at enhancing the overall output power of photovoltaic panels. The adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) has been identified as the most efficient approach for MPPT due to its rapid response time and reduced oscillation, despite the existence of alternative techniques. Nevertheless, the acquisition of precise training data poses a significant obstacle in the development of an effective ANFIS-MPPT. This study focuses on the utilization of the modified fluid search optimization (MFSO) algorithm to regulate the incremental conductance (INC) controller, thereby ensuring maximum power tracking. The input variables considered in this investigation are the irradiance as well as temperature, while the output parameter is the optimum voltage (V-mpp). A model for MPPT is constructed using MATLAB/Simulink in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The method being proposed has been subjected to testing across various weather conditions. The outcomes of the simulation demonstrate the proficient monitoring of the suggested approach in the presence of various environmental circumstances. The study employs a simulation-based approach to evaluate the efficacy of the MFSO-ANFIS-based MPPT algorithm in achieving global maxima under diverse climate conditions. The obtained results validate the proposed method's effectiveness. This approach exhibits a high degree of efficiency, speed, and stability. The findings indicate that the suggested approach effectively monitors the improved maximum power point with a performance rate exceeding 99.3%.

AB The development of mobile and on the edge applications that embed deep convolutional neural models has the potential to revolutionise healthcare. However, most deep learning models require computational resources that are not available in smartphones or edge devices; an issue that can be faced by means of compact models that require less resources than standard deep learning models. The problem with such models is that they are, at least usually, less accurate than bigger models. We propose to address the accuracy limitation of compact networks with the application of semi-supervised learning techniques. In particular, we perform a thorough comparison of self-training methods, consistency regularisation techniques, and quantization techniques. We present a thorough analysis for the results obtained by combining 11 compact networks and 6 semi-supervised processes when applied to 10 biomedical datasets. Namely, combining semi-supervised methods and compact networks, we can create compact models that are not only as accurate as standard size models, but also faster and lighter. In addition, we have developed a Python library to facilitate the combination of compact networks and semi-supervised learning methods to tackle image classification tasks.

AB The degradation state of a bearing can be monitored effectively by using a wear indicator (WI). A WI curve having smoothness and monotonicity can lay a good foundation for predicting the remaining useful life of the bearing. Most traditional models for bearing WI construction, such as time-frequency indicators and signal decomposition, are complicated; for example, some WI construction models need several models to select from, and their fusion depends on the manual experience of engineers. For example, single and mixed traditional time-frequency indicators, such as the root mean square (RMS), Kurtosis, multiple time-frequency domain fusion. However, the mentioned-above time-frequency domain indicators are difficult to adaptively reflect the operating status of the equipment when the operating conditions of the mechanical system change. Some signal decomposition models are combined with other models and rely on manual experience to extract WI, such as the selection of effective intrinsic mode function components function, parameter setting of empirical mode decomposition and ensemble empirical mode decomposition model, etc. Deep learning models, such as stacked auto encoder (SAE) and convolution neural network, have been widely used in bearing health monitoring and WI construction, because its powerful learning and feature extraction capabilities of multiple hidden layer structures. But these deep learning models are designed to use output labels. Particularly when the data volume is large, it requires manpower, material resources, and experienced engineers to label the data, or it is difficult to label and distinguish the categories of data samples. Therefore, to solve these problems and eliminate the need for manual labor, such as labeling data and selecting models for fusion, we propose using SAE without an output label layer to extract WI from original signals directly. However, an extracted WI curve without good monotonicity (Mon) will result in a poor remaining useful life prediction accuracy. To improve the monotonicity of the extracted WI and reduce the complexity of the WI construction model, we propose an unsupervised enhanced SAE without an output layer, named SINSAE, by adding a sine function of an average value which is calculated form start time to current at each hidden layer to eliminate concussion. Moreover, to demonstrate that our proposed model is better than other models, such as the RMS, Kurtosis, multiple time-frequency domain fusion, SAE, SAE without an output layer, and signal decomposition models, the Mon indicator in this study is used to compare the monotonicity of the extracted WI. Lastly, the results of our experiments using different bearing datasets and various working conditions show that the smoothness and monotonicity of the WI curve extracted by the SINSAE is better than that of other models. Moreover, compared to the traditional commonly used single and multiple time-frequency domain indicators, supervised deep learning and basic unsupervised deep models, the unsupervised SINSAE model can increase the Mon indicators from [0.1, 0.8], [0.02, 0.1], [0.1, 0.8] to above 0.9, respectively.

AB Countersink inspection is crucial in various automated assembly lines, especially in the aerospace and automotive sectors. Advancements inmachine vision introduced automated robotic inspection of countersinks using laser scanners and monocular cameras. Nevertheless, the aforementioned sensing pipelines require the robot to pause on each hole for inspection due to high latency and measurement uncertainties with motion, leading to prolonged execution times of the inspection task. The neuromorphic vision sensor, on the other hand, has the potential to expedite the countersink inspection process, but the unorthodox output of the neuromorphic technology prohibits utilizing traditional image processing techniques. Therefore, novel event-based perception algorithms need to be introduced. We propose a countersink detection approach on the basis of event-based motion compensation and the mean-shift clustering principle. In addition, our framework presents a robust event-based circle detection algorithm to precisely estimate the depth of the countersink specimens. The proposed approach expedites the inspection process by a factor of 10x compared to conventional countersink inspection methods. The work in this paper was validated for over 50 trials on three countersink workpiece variants. The experimental results show that our method provides a standard deviation of 0.025 mm and an accuracy of 0.026 mm for countersink depth inspection despite the lowresolution of commercially available neuromorphic cameras.

ID ENTROPY
AB The reforming and updating of power systems play a key role in promoting the low-carbon technology progress, saving non-renewable energy resources and reducing carbon emissions. The evaluation of power system reform proposals is an uncertain multiple-criteria decision-making problem given that some indicators cannot be represented by real numbers such as the expected effect of the power system upgrade. The hesitant fuzzy set, as a powerful tool to portray uncertain information by several possible membership functions, is introduced to represent the evaluation information for power system reform proposals. First, based on the linear interpolation method and the proposed ignorance degree, we obtain the defuzzification value involving the linguistic term part and corresponding probability part. Next, the water-filling algorithm is utilized to determine the objective weight of the criterion by the optimization model to maximize the total capacity of the criteria. Then, to model uncertainties associated with intricate decision-making situations and conflicting assessments, the evidential reasoning algorithm is extended to the hesitant fuzzy environment. The proposed hesitant fuzzy evidential reasoning method not only manages conflicting evaluation information but also avoids information loss or distortion. The proposed method is applied to rank the proposals after establishing the indicator system for power system reform. Finally, sensitivity and comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method with a series of simulation experiments and nonparametric tests.

AB Due to the rapid expansion of online platforms, review-based recommender systems have become the standard way to determine consumers' preferences for various goods. The purpose of this study is to address three significant issues with review-based approaches. First, these techniques suffer from a class-imbalance problem, where rating levels with lower proportions are partially neglected. As a result, their rating performance for such rare levels is unsatisfactory. To address this drawback, this paper proposes a flexible dual-optimizer network that enhances performance by utilizing classification and regression losses in the first attempt to solve this problem. Second, the typical review-based approach of preprocessing review texts with word embeddings will result in inadequate contextual information extraction. Thus, the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformers (BERT) method is introduced as the preprocessing technique to fully extract semantic information. Third, existing techniques make recommendations without considering that the user preferences may change over time. We suggest a time-varying feature extraction scheme that includes a multiscale convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory to solve this problem. We then develop an interactive component that summarizes the contextual information associated with the user-item pairings. The efficiency of the proposed time-varying attention with dual-optimizer (TADO) model is demonstrated through extensive tests on 12 benchmark datasets derived from Amazon Product Reviews. Regarding the existing state-of-the-art techniques, the proposed model attains a substantial performance increase of 22.69%, 8.75%, and 17.35%, respectively, over the Aspect-aware Latent Factor Model (ALFM), Multi-Pointer Co-Attention Networks for recommendation (MPCN), and Aspect-based Neural Recommender (ANR). Moreover, an ablation study demonstrates the importance of jointly employing the components developed for TADO.

TI LANDMARK: language-guided representation enhancement framework for scene

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Scene graph generation; Unbiased method; Vision-language representation
   learning; Multi-semantics
AB Scene graph generation (SGG) is a sophisticated task that suffers from both complex visual features and the long-tail problem. Recently, various unbiased strategies have been proposed by designing novel loss functions and data balancing strategies. Unfortunately, these unbiased methods fail to emphasize language priors in the feature refinement perspective. Inspired by the fact that predicates are highly correlated with semantics hidden in subject-object pair and global context, we propose LANDMARK (LANguage-guiDed representation enhanceMent frAmewoRK) that learns predicate-relevant representations from language-vision interactive patterns, global language context, and object-predicate correlation. Specifically, we first project object labels to three distinctive semantic embeddings for different representation learning. Then, Language Attention Module (LAM) and Experience Estimation Module (EEM) processes subject-object word embeddings to attention vector and predicate distribution, respectively. Language Context Module (LCM) encodes global context from each word embedding, which avoids isolated learning from local information. Finally, module outputs are used to update visual representations and the SGG model's prediction. All language representations are purely generated from object categories so that no extra knowledge is needed. This framework is model-agnostic and consistently improves performance on existing SGG models. Besides, representation-level unbiased strategies endow LANDMARK with compatibility of other methods. Code is available at https://github.com/rafa-cxg/PySGG-cxg.

ID TIME; MAINTENANCE
AB A novel AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle) control architecture has recently been proposed where the AGV is controlled remotely by a virtual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), which is deployed on a Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) platform and connected to the AGV via a radio link in a 5G network. In this scenario, we leverage advanced deep learning techniques based on ensembles of N-BEATS (state-of-the-art in time-series forecasting) to build predictive models that can anticipate the deviation of the AGV's trajectory even when network perturbations appear. Therefore, corrective maneuvers, such as stopping the AGV, can be performed in advance to avoid potentially harmful situations. The main contribution of this work is an innovative application of the N-BEATS architecture for AGV deviation prediction using sequence-to-sequence modeling. This novel approach allows for a flexible adaptation of the forecast horizon to the AGV operator's current needs, without the need for model retraining or sacrificing performance. As a second contribution, we extend the N-BEATS architecture to incorporate relevant information from exogenous variables alongside endogenous variables. This joint consideration enables more accurate predictions and enhances the model's overall performance. The proposed solution was thoroughly evaluated through realistic scenarios in a real factory environment with 5G connectivity and compared against main representatives of deep learning architectures (LSTM), machine learning techniques (Random Forest), and statistical methods (ARIMA) for time-series forecasting. We demonstrate that the deviation of AGVs can be effectively detected by using ensembles of our extended N-BEATS architecture that clearly outperform the other methods. Finally, a careful analysis of a real-time deployment of our solution was conducted, including retraining scenarios that could be triggered by the appearance of data drift problems.

ID CONTOURLET TRANSFORM; SUPERRESOLUTION
AB Depth map super resolution has been paid much attention in 3D applications due to the limitation of depth sensors. Few textures in objects with clear contours along them is the most important characteristic of depth map. An efficient image representation should be directional, multiscale and anisotropic. From this we propose a novel multiscale and multidirection depth map super resolution framework with semantic inference to improve the quality of depth maps. In this framework, a multiscale and multidirection depth map contour fusion scheme captures and assembles intrinsic geometrical structures through a multiview non-subsampled contourlet transform manner. This scheme not only isolates the discontinuities of contours but retains the smoothness along the contours. The semantic inference is also utilized to segment and label the depth map into objects/backgrounds-level which are coplanar. Furthermore, a semantic-aware label refinement strategy is introduced to correct the rarely inaccurate labels of the label map for upscaling the target pixel with pixels in the same object or background. Experimental results on benchmark depth map dataset demonstrate that the proposed multiscale and multidirection depth map super resolution framework with semantic inference has a significant improvement than the state-of-the-art algorithms both visually and quantitatively.

ID MOVING CAMERA; SEGMENTATION
AB A good understanding of geometrical concepts as well as a broad familiarity with objects lead to excellent human perception of moving objects. The human ability to detect and segment moving objects works in the presence of multiple objects, complex background geometry, motion of the observer and even camouflage. How we perceive moving objects so reliably is a longstanding research question in computer vision and borrows findings from related areas such as psychology, cognitive science and physics. One approach to the problem is to teach a deep network to model all of these effects. This is in contrast with the strategy used by human vision, where cognitive processes and body design are tightly coupled and each is responsible for certain aspects of correctly identifying moving objects. Similarly, from the computer vision perspective there is evidence that classical, geometry-based techniques are better suited to the "motion-based" parts of the problem, while deep networks are more suitable for modeling appearance. In this work, we argue that the coupling of camera rotation and camera translation can create complex motion fields that are difficult for a deep network to untangle directly. We present a novel probabilistic model to estimate the camera's rotation given the motion field. We then rectify the flow field to obtain a rotation-compensated motion field for subsequent segmentation. This strategy of first estimating camera motion, and then allowing a network to learn the remaining parts of the problem, yields improved results on the widely used DAVIS benchmark as well as the more recent motion segmentation data set MoCA (Moving Camouflaged Animals).

TI Crots: Cross-Domain Teacher-Student Learning for Source-Free Domain
   Adaptive Semantic Segmentation

ID ADAPTATION
AB Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to transfer source knowledge to the target domain from pre-trained source models without accessing private source data. Existing SFDA methods typically adopt the self-training strategy employing the pre-trained source model to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled target data. However, these methods are subject to strict limitations: (1) The discrepancy between source and target domains results in intense noise and unreliable pseudo-labels. Overfitting noisy pseudo-labeled target data will lead to drastic performance degradation. (2) Considering the class-imbalanced pseudo-labels, the target model is prone to forget the minority classes. Aiming at these two limitations, this study proposes a CROss domain Teacher-Student learning framework (namely CROTS) to achieve source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation. Specifically, with pseudo-labels provided by the intra-domain teacher model, CROTS incorporates Spatial Aware Data Mixing to generate diverse samples by randomly mixing different patches respecting to their spatial semantic layouts. Meanwhile, during inter-domain teacher-student learning, CROTS fosters Rare-Class Patches Mining strategy to mitigate the class imbalance phenomenon. To this end, the inter-domain teacher model helps exploit long-tailed rare classes and promote their contributions to student learning. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that: (1) CROTS mitigates the overfitting issue and contributes to stable performance improvement, i.e., + 16.0% mIoU and + 16.5% mIoU for SFDA in GTA5?Cityscapes and SYNTHIA?Cityscapes, respectively; (2) CROTS improves task performance for longtailed rare classes, alleviating the issue of class imbalance; (3) CROTS achieves superior performance comparing to other SFDA competitors; (4) CROTS can be applied under the black-box SFDA setting, even outperforming many white-box SFDA methods. Our codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/luoxin13/CROTS.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB A solver's runtime and the quality of the solutions it generates are strongly influenced by its parameter settings. Finding good parameter configurations is a formidable challenge, even for fixed problem instance distributions. However, when the instance distribution can change over time, a once effective configuration may no longer provide adequate performance. Realtime algorithm configuration (RAC) offers assistance in finding high-quality configurations for such distributions by automatically adjusting the configurations it recommends based on instances seen so far. Existing RAC methods treat the solver as a black box, meaning the solver is given a configuration as input, and it outputs either a solution or runtime as an objective function for the configurator. However, analyzing intermediate output from the solver can enable configurators to avoid wasting time on poorly performing configurations. We propose a gray-box approach that utilizes intermediate output during evaluation and implement it within the RAC method Contextual Preselection with Plackett-Luce (CPPL blue). We apply cost-sensitive machine learning with pairwise comparisons to determine whether ongoing evaluations can be terminated to free resources. We compare our approach to a black-box equivalent on several experimental settings and show that our approach reduces the total solving time in several scenarios and improves solution quality in an additional scenario.

AB Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is one of the oldest healing systems, which plays an essential role in daily health management. However, TCM is frequently controversial due to its subjectivity and lack of scientific quantification. Modern sensing technologies, enabling the detection of various physiological signals, have the remarkable performance of multifunctionality, superintegration, and ultraminiaturization. Combining with modern sensing technology is a good opportunity for the modernization, objectification, and scientization of TCM. This article proposes an intelligent wristband for simultaneous multiparameter measurement of pulse, skin temperature, and perspiration, essential physiological signals in TCM. As a significant functional material, a carbon nanotube/poly(dimethylsiloxane) nanocomposite with 3D interpenetrating network structures exhibits great electrical conductivity, stress effect, and thermoresistive effect, ensuring intelligent wristband's high accuracy, high sensitivity, and good stability for pulse and temperature measurements. Furthermore, the perspiration sensing unit is also integrated. The as-prepared intelligent wristband is applied during fumigation and washing therapy, and artificial intelligence is introduced to judge whether the user is during fumigation and washing therapy or in the resting state by classifying the user's physiological state, with an accuracy of up to 100%. This work offers a unique strategy for TCM and wearable sensing technology with an important practical significance.

AB Sleep problems are serious issues that make life difficult for all people, including sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, which causes breathlessness for more than 10 s, is linked to severe health problems due to the serious damage it can induce. To mitigate the risk of these disorders, the monitoring of patients has become increasingly challenging. Wearable technologies offer an effective healthcare solution for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis. A novel wearable system based on Arduino technology is introduced, specifically designed to monitor the breath patterns of patients. The analysis of breath data from patients holds great importance for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of sleep apnea. To address this need, an advanced image processing system based on deep learning techniques is presented. This system automatically detects respiratory patterns, including inhalation, exhalation, and breathlessness. The device has an average of 97.6% sensitivity, 79.7% specificity, and 96% accuracy in identifying breath patterns. The designed device can offer patients and healthcare institutions a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and ergonomic system for the analysis of breath patterns that can be further extended for sleep apnea diagnosis.

AB For multivariate time series forecasting problems, entirely using the dependencies between series is a crucial way to achieve accurate forecasting. Real-life multivariate time series often have complex time dependence, spatial dependence and high nonlinearity simultaneously, so Euclidean space is no longer sufficient to describe them. graph neural network presents a vital idea to solve this problem by modelling multivariate time series as graphs. Using the nature of graphs makes it possible to capture the dependencies between multivariate time series. However, no graph structure can perfectly characterize the relationships among multivariate time series; the facts underlying multivariate time series are much more complex. Therefore, we propose an integrated model (iGoRNN), which improves the model's understanding of the deep relationships of multivariate time series by fusing the information captured by multiple graph operators through an integrator with a specific structure. In addition, we conducted experiments on the Metr-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the baseline model in three evaluation metrics, MAE, MAPE and RMSE, and can forecast complex multivariate time series.

AB Facial beauty prediction (FBP) is a frontier topic in the fields of machine learning and computer vision, focusing on how to enable computers to judge facial beauty like humans. The existing FBP methods are mainly based on deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs lack global characteristics and only build local dependencies, so FBP still suffers from insufficient supervision information, low accuracy and overfitting. A transformer is a self-attention-based architecture that possesses better global characteristics than DNNs and can build long-term dependencies. Transformers have been widely used to solve some computer vision problems in recent years and have produced better results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive transformer with global and local multihead self-attention for FBP, called GLAFormer. However, GLAFormer does not converge and is prone to overfitting when the training samples are insufficient. The broad learning system (BLS) can accelerate the model convergence process and reduce overfitting. Therefore, we further combine GLAFormer with the BLS to form TransBLS, in which a GLAFormer block is designed as a feature extractor, the features extracted by it are transferred to the BLS for further refining and fitting, and the results are output. Experimental results indicate that TransBLS achieves state-of-the-art FBP performance on several datasets with different scales, better solving the low accuracy and overfitting problems encountered in FBP. It can also be widely applied in pattern recognition and object detection tasks.

AB The use of computer-assisted legal judgment prediction (LJP) is a current research hotspot, driven by advances in artificial intelligence technology. Previous LJP methods have mainly relied on feature models and emphasized parameter sharing within the coding layer, ignoring progressive sequential relationships between LJP subtasks as well as potential similarity correlations between cases. These limitations have hindered the improvement of the accuracy of LJP methods. This article proposes an LJP algorithm, called MTL-LJP, based on optimised multi-task learning that fuses similarity correlations. MTL-LJP uses EnMo to encode cases and SiMa to compute similarity matrices between cases. MuTa, which is based on multi-task learning, is used to predict LJP subtasks. EnMo vectorises case facts from multiple perspectives using encoders based on CNN, Bi-GRU, Bi-GRU with attention mechanism and MMoE. SiMa computes centroids and distance vectors based on historical case labels and LJP subtask predictions, allowing the computation of similarity matrices for each subtask with low computational complexity. MuTa predicts subsequent subtasks by using the intermediate results of previous subtasks through the forward auxiliary mechanisms. MuTa modifies predictions by correlating the similarity of cases. Experimental results on several real case datasets show that MTL-LJP outperforms previous methods on LJP subtasks.

AB In practical scenarios, many graphs dynamically evolve over time. The new node classification without labels and historical information is challenging. To address this challenge, we design a double-layer attentive graph convolutional network (DLA-GCN) based on the transfer learning, which mainly includes three deep learning components: the double-layer graph convolutional network (DLGCN), node multi-parameter learning (NMPL) algorithm, and domain-adversarial transfer learning (DATL) method. In terms of dynamic spatial correlation, DLGCN jointly exploits the pre-defined and adaptive adjacency matrix to capture local and global feature aggregation. An inter-graph attention mechanism is further used to produce a unified representation for each node in graphs by automatically merging different spatial correlations. To reduce the complexity and improve accuracy, the matrix decomposition method is designed to learn the node-specific patterns of nodes in the NMPL component. In terms of dynamic time correlation, DATL is proposed to learns and transfers similar features as historical information of new nodes by optimizing three different loss functions, namely source classifier loss, domain classifier loss, and target classifier loss as a whole. The experimental results on two real-world graph classification datasets show that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy by 18% and 10%, respectively, compared with the state-of-art baselines.

AB This paper researches robust H-8 asynchron-ous fault detection for uncertain singular Markov jump systems with time-varying delays based on hidden Marko-v model strategy. The aim is to implement asynchronous fault detection for uncertain singular Markov jump system and realize stochastic admissibility with H-8 performance level for augmented uncertain singular Markov jump fault detection system. By applying singular value decomposition method and free weighting matrix technique, modified admissibility conditions are addressed based on Lyapunov stability theory. Robust fault detection problem is translated into H-8 filter design in this work. A hidden Markov model is used to describe a kind of asynchronous phenomenon produced by original system's modes and fault detection filter's modes, and the desired filter gains are obtained by solving linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example and a direct current motor system are used to verify the effectiveness of this approach.
