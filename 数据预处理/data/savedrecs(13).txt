ID MODEL
AB Deep neural networks are static by nature, meaning they use a single set of parameters to process each data sample. However, for more complex and larger systems, for which samples can be obtained under a large variety of circumstances, a need for more dynamic networks that adapt to these variations seems apparent. To this end, the concept of context information and its integration in deep learning is considered. Contrary to current practices, that treat all modalities as equally informative to the decision process, contextual and feature information is considered to be vastly different in nature. A set of definitions and subsequent arguments are given in order to provide the necessary clarification regarding the interpretation of context with the purpose of using all information in a maximally efficient way. From this interpretation, a problem statement of context aware deep learning is constructed and consequently linked to its multiple model and transfer learning solutions. These solutions, however, are in-efficient since samples are spread across models. Based on the existence of this multiple model solution, a new approach, which integrates contextual information directly into a single context-dependent model, is proposed. This single model uses weight matrices that are dynamically assembled based on the contextual information to process each data sample individually. This allows for the single model to consume and learn from all samples. The corresponding training routine is constructed and evaluated on multiple benchmark problems. We start with an artificially generated problem on which the methods' ability to model multiple linear classification problems concurrently is confirmed. Next, both a time series forecasting and image classification dataset are used for evaluation. Evaluations of our proposed method are done and compared to standard context aware implementations based on concatenation and gating. These standard methods implement context information by adding additional parameters in order to try modeling all interactions between the context information and the samples. However, our proposed approach integrates the contextual information directly into the network weights, allowing parameter efficient modeling of dynamic contextual behavior. In both cases the proposed solution outperforms its standard counterparts with significant margins in both evaluation metrics and parameter efficiency. Specifically, a mean absolute error improvement of eleven standard deviations and an eight percent increase in classification accuracy, for the forecasting and image classification problems respectively, is observed, showing the potential of our approach.

TI Occupational models from 42 million unstructured job postings

DT Article
AB Structuring jobs into occupations is the first step for analysis tasks in many fields of research, including economics and public health, as well as for practical applications like matching job seekers to available jobs. We present a data resource, derived with natural language processing techniques from over 42 million unstructured job postings in the National Labor Exchange, that empirically models the associations between occupation codes (estimated initially by the Standardized Occupation Coding for Computer-assisted Epidemiological Research method), skill keywords, job titles, and full-text job descriptions in the United States during the years 2019 and 2021. We model the probability that a job title is associated with an occupation code and that a job description is associated with skill keywords and occupation codes. Our models are openly available in the sockit python package, which can assign occupation codes to job titles, parse skills from and assign occupation codes to job postings and resumes, and estimate occupational similarity among job postings, resumes, and occupation codes.

AB Emerging economies are predicted to be future emission hotspots due to expected levels of urbanization and industrialization, and their CO2 emissions are receiving more scrutiny. However, the driving forces underlying dynamic change in emissions are poorly understood, despite their crucial role in developing targeted miti-gating pathways. We firstly compile energy-related emissions of 30 selective emerging economies from 2010 to 2018. Then, three growth patterns of emissions in these economies have been identified through emission data, which imply different low-carbon pathways. Most emerging economies saw an increase of varying degrees in emissions, driven by economic growth and partly offset by better energy efficiency and improvements in energy mixes. Furthermore, the industrial structure was another factor that slowed emis-sions, especially in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our research contributes to the heterogeneous explo-ration of CO2 emissions produced by energy among sectors and the creation of low-carbon development pathways in emerging economies.

ID CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB This paper presents a Tamil language (TL) encoder that benefits advanced encryption technologies such as the advanced encryption standard (AES). It defines a product set of vowel and consonant sounds of the Tamil language and reveals its connection to Hardy-Ramanujan prime factors and Tamil letters as a one-to-one mapping. It also reveals that the Tamil letters, combined with the digits from 1 to 9, form a Galois field of 28 over an irreducible polynomial of degree 8. Additionally, it implements these two mathematical properties, models the TL encoder, and replaces the pre-round transformation of AES with the model to enhance cryptographic strengths. The cryptographic strengths are measured by the runs test scores of the bit sequences of the ciphers of AES and compared with that of English language. The modeling and simulation conclude that the TL encoder enhances the cryptographic strength of AES at every step of the encryption flow.

TI Malicious source code detection using a translation model
SO PATTERNS
LA English
DT Article
AB Modern software development often relies on open-source code sharing. Open-source code reuse, however, allows hackers to access wide developer communities, thereby potentially affecting many products. An increasing number of such "supply chain attacks"have occurred in recent years, taking advantage of open-source software development practices. Here, we introduce the Malicious Source code Detection using a Translation model (MSDT) algorithm. MSDT is a novel deep-learning-based analysis method that detects real-world code injections into source code packages. We have tested MSDT by embedding exam-ples from a dataset of over 600,000 different functions and then applying a clustering algorithm to the resulting embedding vectors to identify malicious functions by detecting outliers. We evaluated MSDT's performance with extensive experiments and demonstrated that MSDT could detect malicious code injec-tions with precision@k values of up to 0.909.

TI Understanding common human driving semantics for autonomous vehicles

DT Article
ID NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Autonomous vehicles will share roads with human-driven vehicles until the transition to fully autonomous transport systems is complete. The critical challenge of improving mutual understanding between both vehicle types cannot be addressed only by feeding extensive driving data into data-driven models but by enabling autonomous vehicles to understand and apply common driving behaviors analogous to human drivers. Therefore, we designed and conducted two electroencephalography experiments for comparing the cerebral activities of human linguistics and driving understanding. The results showed that driving acti-vates hierarchical neural functions in the auditory cortex, which is analogous to abstraction in linguistic un-derstanding. Subsequently, we proposed a neural-informed, semantics-driven framework to understand common human driving behavior in a brain-inspired manner. This study highlights the pathway of fusing neuroscience into complex human behavior understanding tasks and provides a computational neural model to understand human driving behaviors, which will enable autonomous vehicles to perceive and think like hu-man drivers.

AB A comprehensive pan-human spectral library is critical for biomarker discovery using mass spectrometry (MS) -based proteomics. DPHL v.1, a previous pan-human library built from 1,096 data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS data of 16 human tissue types, allows quantifying of 10,943 proteins. Here, we generated DPHL v.2 from 1,608 DDA-MS data. The data included 586 DDA-MS data acquired from 18 tissue types, while 1,022 files were derived from DPHL v.1. DPHL v.2 thus comprises data from 24 sample types, including several cancer types (lung, breast, kidney, and prostate cancer, among others). We generated four variants of DPHL v.2 to include semi-tryptic peptides and protein isoforms. DPHL v.2 was then applied to two colorectal cancer cohorts. The numbers of identified and significantly dysregulated proteins increased by at least 21.7% and 14.2%, respectively, compared with DPHL v.1. Our findings show that the increased human proteome coverage of DPHL v.2 provides larger pools of potential protein biomarkers.

DE Response selection; Chatbots; Neural networks
AB In this paper we present the results of our experiments in training and deploying a self-supervised retrieval-based chatbot trained with contrastive learning for assisting customer support agents. In contrast to most existing research papers in this area where the focus is on solving just one component of a deployable chatbot, we present a complete set of solutions to take the reader from an unlabelled chatlog corpus to a real-life chatbot, deployed in a scalable manner.. This set of solutions includes creating a self-supervised dataset and a weakly labelled dataset from chatlogs, as well as a systematic approach to selecting a fixed list of canned responses. We present a hierarchical-based RNN architecture for the response selection model, chosen for its ability to cache intermediate utterance embeddings, which helped to meet deployment inference speed requirements. We compare the performance of this architecture across 3 different learning objectives: self-supervised contrastive learning, binary classification, and multi-class classification. We find that using a self-supervised contrastive learning model outperforms training the binary and multi-class classification models on a weakly labelled dataset. Our results validate that the self-supervised contrastive learning approach can be effectively used for a real-world chatbot scenario.

AB This paper presents a quantized-state-based decentralized control strategy for uncertain interconnected nonlinear systems with time-varying delays under a networked control environment. Full state variables quantized via a uniform-hysteretic quantizer are available only for a decentralized adaptive control design. Unlike the existing decentralized adaptive recursive control designs, this study is focused on establishing a quantized-state based decentralized learning mechanism for neural networks using discontinuously quantized states. Moreover, the stability of a decentralized neural network tracking system in the presence of time delays is analyzed. For each subsystem, a neural-network-based local adaptive tracker using a delay compensator is designed based on the local quantized state feedback. Technical lemmas pertaining to quantization errors and adaptive laws are presented to ensure the boundedness of all closed-loop signals and the convergence of local tracking errors to an adjustable neighborhood of the origin. Finally, illustrative simulations clarify and verify the decentralization strategy of the developed state-quantized adaptive tracking system. The control performance is evaluated using the root mean square control errors, where the values are 0.0293 and 0.0134 for each subsystem in Example 1 and 0.0467 and 0.0384 for each subsystem in Example 2.

AB The identification of DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) sites is an important field of bioinformatics. Statistical learning methods and deep learning have been applied in this direction. The previous methods focused on feature representation and feature selection, and did not take into account the deviation of noise samples for recognition. Moreover, these models were not established from the perspective of prediction error distribution. To solve the problem of complex error distribution, we propose a maximum multi-correntropy criterion based kernelized higher-order fuzzy inference system (MMC-KHFIS), which is constructed with multi-correntropy fusion. There are 6 4mC and 8 UCI data sets are employed to evaluate our model. The MMC-KHFIS achieves better performance in the experiment.

AB A mapping f from a bitopological space (X, tau(1), tau(2)) into a bitopological space (Y, tau (1), t(2) 2) is said to be a pair-homeomorphism if and only if the induced functions f1 : ( X, tau(1)) -> (Y, tau '(1)) 1) and f(2) : ( X, tau(2)) -> (Y, tau '(2)) 2) are homeomorphisms. The deck of a bitopological space ( X, tau(1), tau(2)) is the set D (X) = {[ Xx(]) : x epsilon X}, where [ Z] denotes the pair-homeomorphism class of Z. A bitopological space X is reconstructible if whenever D( X) = D(Y) then ( X, tau(1), tau(2)) is pair-homeomorphic to (Y, tau(1) tau(2)) A property P of a bitopological space X is recognizable if D( X) = D(Y) implies " X has P if and only if Y has P ''. It is shown that every finite bitopological space with at most three non pair-homeomorphic cards and no isolated point is recognizable.

ID ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING; SIMILARITY MEASURES; MEAN OPERATORS; SETS
AB Interval-valued q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (IVq-ROFNs), as a generalization of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers, are a more robust and reliable tool when dealing with uncertain information during decision-making processes, and can therefore be applied to a broader range of situations. This paper presents an approach to a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) problem in an IVq-ROF environment. In decision-making, the most sensitive part is information fusion (information aggregation); for this purpose, we extend the Einstein geometric aggregation operator for IVq-ROFNs. Einstein operators are valuable in information fusion, as they consider the interrelationship between arguments. Thus, while dealing with the information fusion process, the interrelationship between arguments ensures that aggregated values do not lose information. We use the traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) approach to rank the alternatives based on the attributes. In the GRA approach, we use positive and negative ideal solutions to obtain the grey relational coefficient (GRC). The GRCs of alternatives are calculated based on a new distance measure, which utilizes the hesitancy or indeterminacy degree of IVq-ROFNs. Utilizing the hesitancy or indeterminacy degree in distance measures reduces information loss significantly. The proposed approach considers three cases of attributes' weights: partially known, completely unknown, and known. Consideration of three cases of attributes' weights allows the approach to be applied to any appropriate MAGDM problem. We establish an optimization model to compute partially known attributes' weights; we use the entropy weight determination method to compute unknown attributes' weights. Finally, we discuss a real-world case study to validate the proposed approach.

AB According to research, lung cancer is the highest mortality rate in today's society, and it has been increasing every year. The new DNA nanoprobe diagnostic technology integrates DNA technology and nanotechnology, resulting in higher sensitivity and faster speed in detecting tumor markers. To analyze and study whether it is possible to use functional DNA nanoprobes to detect tumor markers while incorporating immune checkpoint inhibitors and combined use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and its predictive value. This article will select 120 patients with non-small cell lung cancer from hospitals in A City and divide them into an observation group and a control group. The control group treated patients through existing treatment methods, while the observation group added PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors to the control group for treatment. The proportion of complete remission clinical efficacy in the control group was 24%, 20% in partial remission clinical efficacy, 18% in stable clinical efficacy, 38% in progressive clinical efficacy, and 62% in total effective clinical efficacy; the proportion of complete remission clinical efficacy in the observation group is 40%, partial remission clinical efficacy is 26%, stable clinical efficacy is 18%, progressive clinical efficacy is 16%, and total effective clinical efficacy is 84%. Through this experiment, not only can the treatment effect of patients be greatly improved, but the number of surviving patients also increases, and the toxicity and side effects are also lower than those of ordinary treatment.

AB IntroductionStroke survivors often compensate for the loss of motor function in their distal joints by altered use of more proximal joints and body segments. Since this can be detrimental to the rehabilitation process in the long-term, it is imperative that such movements are indicated to the patients and their caregiver. This is a difficult task since compensation strategies are varied and multi-faceted. Recent works that have focused on supervised machine learning methods for compensation detection often require a large training dataset of motions with compensation location annotations for each time-step of the recorded motion. In contrast, this study proposed a novel approach that learned a linear classifier from energy-based features to discriminate between healthy and compensatory movements and identify the compensating joints without the need for dense and explicit annotations. MethodsSix healthy physiotherapists performed five different tasks using healthy movements and acted compensations. The resulting motion capture data was transformed into joint kinematic and dynamic trajectories. Inspired by works in bio-mechanics, energy-based features were extracted from this dataset. Support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) algorithms were then applied for detection of compensatory movements. For compensating joint identification, an additional condition enforcing the independence of the feature calculation for each observable degree of freedom was imposed. ResultsUsing leave-one-out cross validation, low values of mean brier score (<0.15), mis-classification rate (<0.2) and false discovery rate (<0.2) were obtained for both SVM and LR classifiers. These methods were found to outperform deep learning classifiers that did not use energy-based features. Additionally, online classification performance by our methods were also shown to outperform deep learning baselines. Furthermore, qualitative results obtained from the compensation joint identification experiment indicated that the method could successfully identify compensating joints. DiscussionResults from this study indicated that including prior bio-mechanical information in the form of energy based features can improve classification performance even when linear classifiers are used, both for offline and online classification. Furthermore, evaluation compensation joint identification algorithm indicated that it could potentially provide a straightforward and interpretable way of identifying compensating joints, as well as the degree of compensation being performed.

AB A large law firm typically exhibits a collective intelligence comprised of hundreds or thousands of legal minds aimed at simultaneously engaging thousands of active matters across scores of industries and dozens of practice specialties with distinct doctrinal and procedural characteristics. The firm is challenged not only to achieve successful, cost-effective outcomes for its clients, but must also simultaneously, in competition with other firms and alternative service providers, attract and cultivate talent, develop and coordinate capabilities across multiple evolving areas of practice and continually improve a robust collective intelligence to gain a competitive edge. As various types of machine intelligences and tools are introduced, firms must also groom these into the collective. In this paper we explore a human-machine hybrid system for addressing this large scale, multi-dimensional, dynamic optimization challenge to coordinate a collective intelligence of humans and machines. Machine intelligence is needed to handle the computational complexity and it is complemented by human intelligence to help handle exceptions and novel situations. We believe this approach has potential for transforming the collective intelligence that is the large law firm.

AB Swarming or collective motion is ubiquitous in natural systems, and instrumental in many technological applications. Accordingly, research interest in this phenomenon is crossing discipline boundaries. A common major question is that of the intricate interactions between the individual, the group, and the environment. There are, however, major gaps in our understanding of swarming systems, very often due to the theoretical difficulty of relating embodied properties to the physical agents-individual animals or robots. Recently, there has been much progress in exploiting the complementary nature of the two disciplines: biology and robotics. This, unfortunately, is still uncommon in swarm research. Specifically, there are very few examples of joint research programs that investigate multiple biological and synthetic agents concomitantly. Here we present a novel research tool, enabling a unique, tightly integrated, bio-inspired, and robot-assisted study of major questions in swarm collective motion. Utilizing a quintessential model of collective behavior-locust nymphs and our recently developed Nymbots (locust-inspired robots)-we focus on fundamental questions and gaps in the scientific understanding of swarms, providing novel interdisciplinary insights and sharing ideas disciplines. The Nymbot-Locust bio-hybrid swarm enables the investigation of biology hypotheses that would be otherwise difficult, or even impossible to test, and to discover technological insights that might otherwise remain hidden from view.

AB Music can serve as a potent tool for conveying emotions and regulating learners' moods, while the systematic application of emotional assessment can help to improve teaching efficiency. However, existing music emotion analysis methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) rely primarily on pre-marked content, such as lyrics and fail to adequately account for music signals' perception, transmission, and recognition. To address this limitation, this study first employs sound-level segmentation, data frame processing, and threshold determination to enable intelligent segmentation and recognition of notes. Next, based on the extracted audio features, a Radial Basis Function (RBF) model is utilized to construct a music emotion classifier. Finally, correlation feedback was used to label the classification results further and train the classifier. The study compares the music emotion classification method commonly used in Chinese music education with the Hevner emotion model. It identifies four emotion categories: Quiet, Happy, Sad, and Excited, to classify performers' emotions. The testing results demonstrate that audio feature recognition time is a mere 0.004 min, with an accuracy rate of over 95%. Furthermore, classifying performers' emotions based on audio features is consistent with conventional human cognition.

AB In this article, a method of railway catenary insulator defects detection is proposed, named RCID-YOLOv5s. In order to improve the network's ability to detect defects in railway catenary insulators, a small object detection layer is introduced into the network model. Moreover, the Triplet Attention (TA) module is introduced into the network model, which pays more attention to the information on the defective parts of the railway catenary insulator. Furthermore, the pruning operations are performed on the network model to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, by comparing with the original YOLOv5s model, experiment results show that the average precision (AP) of the proposed RCID-YOLOv5s is highest at 98.0%, which can be used to detect defects in railway catenary insulators accurately.

AB Effective denoising strategies are increasingly important for portfolio investors. Considering that the common ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD)-based stepwise denoising algorithms suffer from white noise interference and ignore the effect of low-frequency redundant noise components on the portfolio, a novel complete EEMD with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) denoising algorithm is proposed to improve the portfolio performance. Specifically, we apply CEEMDAN to decompose noisy prices into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, a series of tests based on the correlations between the original noisy prices and the decomposed IMFs are performed to identify which IMFs are noisy modes. If the tests accept the null hypothesis, the IMFs are considered as noisy components. Finally, we use the soft-threshold technique to process the noisy components and sum the non-noisy components to construct the denoised prices. The empirical results show that under the dynamic minimum-CVaR framework, the proposed CEEMDAN denoising algorithm is not affected by white noise and outperforms the EEMD denoising and stepwise denoising algorithms in improving out-of-sample portfolio returns. Overall, the proposed CEEMDAN denoising is the optimal denoising algorithm, which can help investors improve portfolio performance to the greatest extent.

AB In today's life, huge data are being generated from hospitals related to health. Most of the research is carried out on this Big Data which is being analysed to detect the disease such that care can be taken at an early stage. But there is a little research towards Big Data networking. Hence, this paper proposes an efficient resource management for Big Data using machine learning in Health Care Machine learning impacts the behaviour of the system. In this paper, bandwidth is considered to be the major resource. Huge data generated from health centres are transmitted to virtual machines for processing and analysis through Health Care Web Service framework. Big Data Analysis Module in virtual machine performs analysis of the data. Machine learning-based scheduling algorithm is proposed in which the deep feed forward layers are incorporated for the appropriate selection of virtual machines that can enhance the resource utilization. The performance metrics such as throughput and network delay are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The virtual machine is selected such that the throughput is more and delay is less. The proposed system, ERMB-DL is simulated and evaluated in terms of throughput, network delay and resource utilization with varying number of data streams and data sizes. The performance of ERMB-DL is compared to the system which incorporates decision tree, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest and proved to be better solution. The network delay with varying data size is reduced by 62.2%, 34.4% and 24.1% when compared to decision tree algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours, and random forest algorithms, respectively. Throughput with varying number of data streams is enhanced by 49.4%, 41.3%, and 27.9% when compared to decision tree algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours, and random forest algorithms, respectively. Resource Utilization with varying number of data streams is enhanced by 9.6%, 6.3%, and 5.1% when compared to decision tree algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbours, and random forest algorithms, respectively.

AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) leads to vision loss, a significant issue among people with diabetes. The DR significantly impacts society's financial conditions, particularly in the medical sector. With proper treatment, vision loss can be averted in about 90% of DR patients. Thus, there is a need for the development of automated DR detection model to classify the DR's diverse phases as well as levels of severity in order to provide better treatment. Compared to traditional screening methods, deep learning algorithms can provide faster and more accurate results, making screening more efficient and cost-effective. This article will develop a novel Inception V3 model, the custom convolutional neural network (CNN) 15 & 20 layers, as well as the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm-based CNN model, known as the PBIL-CNN model, for the DR's detection as well as classification from the color fundus images. To this end, there is the PBIL's application for detecting quality suboptimal parameters and hyper-parameter sets. The CNN hyper-parameter optimization with an evolutionary algorithm will facilitate the human expertise-based values' replacement with the optimized values. The PBIL-CNN model's simulation is done with a benchmark DR Kaggle database, and its outcomes will demonstrate the PBIL-CNN model's superiority over the existing approaches. It is evident from the simulated outcomes that the PBIL-CNN model could accomplish maximum results.

AB Over the past few years, there has been an increasing demand for enhanced and efficient tools capable of managing ambiguous and uncertain data. An example of such a tool is the Pythagorean fuzzy set, which was initially presented by Yager (in: Proceedings of joint IFSA world congress and NAFIPS annual meeting, June 24-28, Edmonton, Canada, pp 57-61, 2013). On the other hand, game theory has proved to be a useful framework for analyzing competitive situations involving individuals or organizations across multiple fields. Nevertheless, the conventional matrix game models face limitations in addressing issues under Pythagorean fuzzy circumstances. Furthermore, prior research on matrix games has overlooked the importance of considering the self-confidence levels of the involved experts. To overcome these limitations, this contribution presents a new approach for solving two-player zero-sum matrix games with payoffs represented by Pythagorean fuzzy numbers that include self-confidence levels. First, we introduce a novel aggregation operator called the generalized sine trigonometric Pythagorean fuzzy confidence-weighted average (GST-PFCWA) operator. This operator combines PFNs with self-confidence levels, and its mathematical properties and special cases are explored in detail. Next, we develop basic concepts and mathematical models for matrix games with payoffs represented by PFNs with self-confidence levels. In this context, we derive a pair of Pythagorean fuzzy auxiliary linear/nonlinear-programming optimization models that can be used to solve this class of game problems. Finally, the paper presents a numerical example illustrating the proposed solution approach. In summary, this work presents a novel framework that integrates Pythagorean fuzzy sets and game theory to provide a more comprehensive approach for dealing with competitive situations under uncertain and vague information environments.

AB Modeling data acquisition systems (DASs) can support the vehicle industry in the development and design of sophisticated driver assistance systems. Modeling DASs on the basis of multiple criteria is considered as a multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Although literature reviews have provided models for DASs, the issue of imprecise, unclear, and ambiguous information remains unresolved. Compared with existing MCDM methods, the robustness of the fuzzy decision by opinion score method II (FDOSM II) and fuzzy weighted with zero inconsistency II (FWZIC II) is demonstrated for modeling the DASs. However, these methods are implemented in an intuitionistic fuzzy set environment that restricts the ability of experts to provide membership and nonmembership degrees freely, simulate real-world ambiguity efficiently, utilize a narrow fuzzy number space, and deal with interval data. Thus, this study used a more efficient fuzzy environment interval-valued linear Diophantine fuzzy set (IVLDF) with FWZIC II for criterion weighting and IVLDF with FDOSM for DAS modeling to address the issues and support industrial community characteristics in the design and implementation of advanced driver assistance systems in vehicles. The proposed methodology comprises two consecutive phases. The first phase involves adapting a decision matrix that intersects DAS alternatives and criteria. The second phase (development phase) proposes a decision modeling approach based on formulation of IVLD-FWZIC II and IVLD-FDOSM II to model DASs. A total of 14 DASs were modeled on the basis of 15 DAS criteria, including seven subcriteria for "comprehensive complexity assessment" and eight subcriteria for "design and implementation," which had a remarkable effect on the DAS design when implemented by industrial communities. Systematic ranking, sensitivity analysis, and modeling checklists were conducted to demonstrate that the modeling results were subject to systematic ranking, as indicated by the high correlations across all described scenarios of changing criterion weight values, supporting the most important research points, and proposing a value-adding process in modeling the most desirable DAS.

AB This paper aims to evaluate the possibility of applying the nuclear norm minimization technique to the problem of incompleteness of an additive preference pairwise matrix. The proposed technique applies to the case of missing values in any position within a matrix of any order, provided that all the alternatives are connected, or equivalently that there is a preference path between each pair of alternatives. The unknown entries are estimated by finding a matrix that best matches the given entries, assuming that the reconstructed matrix can be well approximated by a lower-rank matrix and that the entries are missing completely at random. A series of applications with simulated data were used to evaluate the validity of the proposed technique, particularly in comparison to another popular technique of missing value estimation based on the minimization of an index measuring matrix inconsistency. The simulation results suggest the effectiveness of nuclear norm minimization as a completion technique in some of the considered setting, in particular if violations of strong transitivity property are considered.

AB This study investigated the three-dimensional (3D) printing of tubular tissue, especially vascular tissue, using a self-developed 3D bioprinter platform and tubular tissue support frame system based on machine vision technology. A 3D printing quality inspection scheme for tubular tissue based on machine vision was proposed by combining the current advanced image acquisition sensor device and theoretical and experimental analysis to measure the printing area in real time. A quantitative relationship between the quality of the tissue profile and the angle and brightness of tissue printed by hydrogel was established by changing the process parameters. A mathematical model for the visual inspection of tissue contour quality was established to realize its visual inspection and evaluation. This method can monitor the quality status of the printing target in real time and provide a basis for improving the accuracy of 3D bioprinting of tubular tissue and shortening the printing time.

AB Deep models need a large number of labeled samples to be trained. Furthermore, in practical application settings where objects' features are added or changed over time, it is difficult and expensive to get enough labeled samples in the beginning. Cognitive learning mechanism can actively raise the deep models' proficiency online with a few training labels gradually. In this paper, inspired by human being's cognition procedure to acquire new knowledge stage by stage, we develop a novel deep active recognition framework based on the analysis of models' cognitive error knowledge to fine-tune the deep models online. The transformation of the cognitive errors is defined, and the corresponding knowledge is obtained to identify the models' cognitive information. Based on the cognitive knowledge, the sensitive samples are selected to finely tune the models online. To avoid forgetting the previous learned knowledge, the selected prior training samples are used as the refreshening samples at the same time. The experiments demonstrate that the sensitive samples can benefit the target recognition and the cognitive learning mechanism can boost the deep models' performance efficiently. The characterization of cognitive information can restrain the other samples' disturbance to the models' cognition effectively and the online training method can save mass of the time evidently. In conclusion, we introduce this work to provide a trial of thought about the cognitive lifelong learning used in deep learning scenarios.

AB Male infertility negatively affects the lives of infertile couples. Sperm head morphology is an essential factor in evaluating semen in male infertility. The lack of samples with abnormal sperm heads compared to the normal sperm head samples makes the classification of sperm head images an imbalance classification problem. In comparison with other deep networks such as convolutional neural networks, capsule neural networks (CapsNets) provide an optimal platform for designing imbalanced classification models by considering spatial relationships of features. Also, generative adversarial networks (GANs) help to improve the imbalanced classification of images by producing suitable synthetic samples. In this paper, a new architecture based on CapsNets and GANs is proposed and evaluated for imbalanced classification of human sperm head images. The new proposed conditional generative adversarial capsule network outperformed other deep learning networks in the balanced and imbalanced classification of human sperm head images. Based on the comparison between the general methods for increasing the data and the proposed network, the general methods have less robustness to reducing the amount of data than the proposed network. The presented network performed a balanced classification of sperm head images with 97.8% accuracy. Additionally, the proposed network maintained an accuracy of over 80% up to the ratio of minority to majority class of 1:30, indicating that it performed properly in the imbalanced classification of sperm images.

   Attention calibration; Synergistic advantage
AB Underwater object detection is a prerequisite for underwater robots to achieve autonomous operation and ocean exploration. However, poor imaging quality, harsh underwater environments and concealed underwater targets greatly aggravate the difficulty of underwater object detection. In order to reduce underwater background interference and improve underwater object perception, we propose a multi-dimensional, multi-functional and multi-level attention module (mDFLAM). The multi-dimensional strategy first enhances the robustness of attention application by collecting valuable information in different target dimensions. The multi-functional strategy further improves the flexibility of attention calibration by capturing the importance of channel semantic information and the dependence of spatial location information. The multi-level strategy finally enriches the diversity of attention perception by extracting the intrinsic information under different receptive fields. In pre-processing and post-processing stages, cross-splitting and cross-linking stimulate the synergistic calibration advantage of multi-dimensional and multi-functional attention by redistributing channel dimensions and restoring feature states. In the attention calibration stage, adaptive fusion stimulates the synergistic calibration advantage of multi-level attention by assigning learnable parameters. In order to meet the high-precision and real-time requirements for underwater object detection, we integrate the plug-and-play mDFLAM into YOLO detectors. The full-port embedding further strengthens the semantic information expression by improving the feature fusion quality between scales. In underwater detection tasks, ablation and comparison experiments demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of our attention design. In other detection tasks, our work shows good robustness and generalization.

AB Hyperparameter optimization is vital in improving the prediction accuracy of support vector regression (SVR), as in all machine learning algorithms. This study introduces a new hybrid optimization algorithm, namely PSOGS, which consolidates two strong and widely used algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and grid search (GS). This hybrid algorithm was experimented on five benchmark datasets. The speed and the prediction accuracy of PSOGS-optimized SVR models (PSOGS-SVR) were compared to those of its constituent algorithms (PSO and GS) and another hybrid optimization algorithm (PSOGSA) that combines PSO and gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The prediction accuracies were evaluated and compared in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error. For the sake of reliability, the results of the experiments were obtained by performing 10-fold cross-validation on 30 runs. The results showed that PSOGS-SVR yields prediction accuracy comparable to GS-SVR, performs much faster than GS-SVR, and provides better results with less execution time than PSO-SVR. Besides, PSOGS-SVR presents more effective results than PSOGSA-SVR in terms of both prediction accuracy and execution time. As a result, this study proved that PSOGS is a fast, stable, efficient, and reliable algorithm for optimizing hyperparameters of SVR.

AB With the development of depth sensors and pose estimation algorithms, human skeleton action recognition based on graph convolutional networks has acquired widespread attention and application. The latest methods achieve dynamically learning different topologies for modeling and use first-order, second-order, and third-order features, i.e., joint, bone, and motion representations, which has led to high accuracy. However, many models are still confused by actions that have similar motion trajectories, and most of the existing methods model the spatial dimension before the temporal dimension, whereas in fact, spatial and temporal information should be interrelated. In this paper, we propose an efficient graph convolutional network based on multi-order feature information (MFGCN) for human skeleton action recognition. Firstly, our method introduces angle features (noted as fourth-order features), which are implicitly embedded in other third-order features by encoding angular features, to powerfully capture detailed features in the spatio-temporal dimension and enhance the ability to distinguish similar actions. Secondly, we use a content-adaptive approach to construct the adjacency matrix and dynamically learn the topology between the skeleton joints. Finally, we develop a spatio-temporal information sliding extraction module (STISE) to improve the inter-correlation of spatial and temporal information. The proposed method has extensively experimented on the NTU-RGB D, NTU-RGB D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA datasets, and the experimental results show that our method can achieve superior performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant harm globally, prompting us to prioritize prevention measures. Effective hand-washing is one of the most critical and straightforward measures that can help prevent the spread of this virus. Medical staff's hands are considered a major source of hospital infection. Effective hand-washing can prevent up to 30% of diarrhea-related illnesses, which is crucial in preventing nosocomial infections (Tartari et al. in Clin Microbiol Infect 23(9):596-598, 2017). This paper proposes an electronic-based real-time hand-washing identification framework called Alpha Hand Washing (ALPHA HW). The system uses camera-based identification, edge computing, and deep learning to automatically identify correct hand-washing behaviors, thereby facilitating effective hand-washing (Bertasius et al. in: Computer vision and pattern recognition, 2015). We achieved an accuracy of 78.0% mAP and a speed of 52 FPS in detecting scenes using specific monitoring datasets in hospitals by constructing the complex recognition system into a grid computing problem. Leveraging edge computing, our system achieves real-time identification with low memory consumption and high-efficiency computation. Alpha HW presents scientific and financial values in epidemic prevention and control that can facilitate popularization to reduce virus spread (Bewley et al. in 2016 IEEE international conference on image processing, 2016).

AB This article presents a cross-domain robot (CDR) that experiences drive efficiency degradation when operating on water surfaces, similar to drive faults. Moreover, the CDR mathematical model has uncertain parameters and non-negligible water resistance. To solve these problems, a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) algorithm is proposed for the robot both on land and water surfaces. The proposed algorithm consists of a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) and an RBFNN. The RBFNN is used to estimate the impact of drive faults, water resistance, and model parameter uncertainty on the robot and the output value compensates the controller. Additionally, an anti-input saturation control algorithm is designed to prevent driver saturation. To optimize the controller parameters, a human decision search algorithm (HDSA) is proposed, which mimics the decision-making process of a crowd. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.

AB Contextual Path Generation (CPG) refers to the task of generating knowledge path(s) between a pair of entities mentioned in an input textual context to determine the semantic connection between them. Such knowledge paths, also called contextual paths, can be very useful in many advanced information retrieval applications. Nevertheless, CPG involves several technical challenges, namely, sparse and noisy input context, missing relations in knowledge graphs, and generation of ill-formed and irrelevant knowledge paths. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based model architecture. In this approach, we leverage a mixture of pre-trained word and knowledge graph embeddings to encode the semantics of input context, a transformer decoder to perform path generation controlled by encoded input context and head entity to stay relevant to the context, and scaling methods to sample a well-formed path. We evaluate our proposed CPG models derived using the above architecture on two real datasets, both consisting of Wikinews articles as input context documents and ground truth contextual paths, as well as a large synthetic dataset to conduct larger-scale experiments. Our experiments show that our proposed models outperform the baseline models, and the scaling methods contribute to better quality contextual paths. We further analyze how CPG accuracy can be affected by different amount of context data, and missing relations in the knowledge graph. Finally, we demonstrate that an answer model for knowledge graph questions adapted for CPG could not perform well due to the lack of an effective path generation module.

ID CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE; DECOMPOSITION
AB Causal discovery is one of the most important research directions in the field of machine learning, aiming to discover the underlying causal relationships in the observed data. In practice, the time complexity of causal discovery will grow exponentially with increasing variables. To alleviate this problem, many methods based on divide-and-conquer strategies have been proposed. Existing methods usually partition the variables heuristically using scattered variables to achieve the dividing process, which makes it difficult to minimize vertex cut-set C and then leads to diminished causal discovery performance. In this work, we design an elaborated causal partition strategy called Causal Partition Base Graph (CPBG) to solve this problem. CPBG uses a set of low-order conditional independence (CI) tests to construct a rough skeleton S corresponding to the observed data and takes a heuristic method to search S for the optimal vertex cut-set C. Then the observed data can be partitioned into multiple variable subsets. We therefore can run a causal discovery method on each part and finally obtain the complete causal structure by merging the partial results. The proposed method is evaluated by various real-world causal datasets. Experimental results show that the CPBG method outperforms its existing counterparts, which proves that the method can support more effective and efficient causal discovery. The source code of the proposed method and all experimental results are available at .

To do this, we propose a new type of fuzzy set called a p, q-cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy set ( p, q-CQOFS). The p, q-CQOFS allows for a more flexible and detailed expression of incomplete information through the use of an additional parameter. The paper describes the concept of p, q-CQOFS and its relationship to other types of fuzzy sets, introduces score and accuracy functions for p, q-CQOFS and analyzes some of its mathematical properties, defines the Hamming distance measure between two p, q-CQOFSs and examines some of its important properties, investigates the basic operations of p, q-CQOFSs and extends these laws to aggregation operators, and introduces weighted averaging and geometric aggregation operators for combining p, q-cubic quasi-rung orthopair fuzzy data.

AB Venture capitalists are heavily influenced by their psychological state and intuition when making investment decisions in uncertain investment environments. To choose promising enterprises in China, it is necessary to understand how to consider both the uncertainty of venture capital and constrained rationality of venture capitalists. Considering the risk of information ambiguity and psychological factors of venture capitalists in a complex environment, a multiple-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach combining TOPSIS and prospect theory is investigated under a probabilistic linguistic q-Rung ortho-pair fuzzy (PLq-ROF) situation. First, a modified weight determination rule is proposed to derive the attribute importance owing to the different preferences of venture capitalists on the attribute sets. Second, psychological risk factors of venture capitalists are introduced into decision-making with the PLq-ROFS, and its prospect value function is also defined. Furthermore, the PLq-ROFS assessment is converted into a value matrix, and based on this, the ratio of gains to losses for each enterprise is computed to determine the ranking of the enterprises. Finally, the application process of the proposed method is demonstrated using Ali Capital as an example to select the most profitable enterprise for venture capitalists. The effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method are further illustrated by a comparison with existing methods.

AB Muscles are stretched with bursts of spikes that come from motor neurons connected to the cerebellum through the spinal cord. Then, alpha motor neurons directly innervate the muscles to complete the motor command coming from upper biological structures. Nevertheless, classical robotic systems usually require complex computational capabilities and relative high-power consumption to process their control algorithm, which requires information from the robot's proprioceptive sensors. The way in which the information is encoded and transmitted is an important difference between biological systems and robotic machines. Neuromorphic engineering mimics these behaviors found in biology into engineering solutions to produce more efficient systems and for a better understanding of neural systems. This paper presents the application of a Spike-based Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller to a 6-DoF Scorbot ER-VII robotic arm, feeding the motors with Pulse-Frequency-Modulation instead of Pulse-Width-Modulation, mimicking the way in which motor neurons act over muscles. The presented frameworks allow the robot to be commanded and monitored locally or remotely from both a Python software running on a computer or from a spike-based neuromorphic hardware. Multi-FPGA and single-PSoC solutions are compared. These frameworks are intended for experimental use of the neuromorphic community as a testbed platform and for dataset recording for machine learning purposes.

AB Metaheuristics represent an evolving problem-solving methodology that has proven to be effective in addressing optimization problems across various fields. Over the years, researchers have continuously strived to enhance the framework of metaheuristics in order to broaden their applicability, bolster their robustness, and ensure greater flexibility. In line with these objectives, we propose a novel framework called the Confluence Metaheuristic, which incorporates the concept of river confluence into the metaheuristic approach. The Confluence Metaheuristic operates by dividing the initial population into multiple streams, each subject to a different stochastic algorithm. These streams eventually converge at a single point and undergo further evolution through a specified number of iterations, yielding optimal results eventually. The proposed framework is of a general nature and has been implemented using two stochastic algorithms: particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive testing on ten benchmark functions. Furthermore, to substantiate the efficacy of our proposed idea, we subjected it to evaluation through three classical engineering problems. Statistical analysis was performed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests, while sensitivity analysis was also conducted. The results obtained from this comprehensive evaluation were found to be highly satisfactory. Additionally, we compared the outcomes of our approach with the latest concept of 'Multipopulation'. Moreover, our study contributes to improving various aspects of the metaheuristic framework, including the development of a more effective initialization strategy, a suitable parameter tuning approach, and an enhanced search technique.

AB Energy can be generated from renewable sources such as geothermal heat, rain, wind, tides, and sunlight. All nations' economies and political systems depend on their access to energy resources. That is, why it is so important for any nation to make the most prudent energy investment decisions possible. Because of climate change, every country has announced its intention to include more renewable energy sources in their energy portfolios. In this work, the authors present hesitant fuzzy multi-factor decision analysis tactics for choosing the best renewable energy sources, building on the insights of a hesitant fuzzy set system, a valuable tool for handling indecision in the occurrence of ambiguous or incomplete data. Based on a hesitant fuzzy analytical hierarchy process technique, this study ranks preferences according to how closely they match an ideal outcome. This is in line with specialized valuation scores that can be written as semantic expressions, hesitant fuzzy numbers, or crisp numbers. Hesitant fuzzy set concepts form the basis of this combined method, and they are used to objectively or subjectively weigh alternatives in light of specific domain-specific requirements. With the proposed strategy, the best renewable energy choice will be identified. According to the achieved results, landfill gas and biogas have the highest rank among the alternatives to renewable energy. The achieved results are compared with another method of fuzzy multicriteria decision-making, and it shows that the hesitant fuzzy decision-making method is found to be the most accurate in providing results on the selection of renewable energy resources. Furthermore, it will help government officials and related individuals decide on better sustainable and renewable energy resources that can cost less and give more sustainable results in the future.

AB Data missing is very common in the spatial-temporal traffic data collected by various detectors, and how to accurately impute the missing values is particularly important in intelligent transportation systems. Because the method based on tensor decomposition has advantages in solving the problem of multidimensional data imputation, in this paper, we regard the missing traffic speed data imputation as a tensor decomposition problem and propose a three-process framework based on the tensor decomposition of spatial-temporal regularization, which imputes the missing traffic speed data by using the hidden spatial-temporal characteristics and underlying structure. Specifically, we first propose a high-precision initialization method based on the low-rank tensor completion model. The experimental results show that the optimal initialization of tensor decomposition has good imputation performance. Then, we design a threshold and flexibly choose the truncation rank in the truncated higher-order singular value decomposition, to get the core tensor of appropriate size and better capture the characteristics of each dimension. Finally, we apply these features and add regularization term constraints related to the time interval of one day and the location of road detectors, and the missing traffic speed data are estimated by spatial-temporal regularized Tucker decomposition (STRTD). In addition to the scenes of element-like random missing (EM) and fiber-like random missing (FM), our experiment also creates a region-like random missing (RM) by imitating the real-world loss. We have done experiments on real-world traffic speed data sets, and the results show that our STRTD model is better than the most advanced imputation model at present, even in the case of a high missing rate.

   aware adversarial training
AB Adversarial training has been empirically shown to be more prone to overfitting than standard training. The exact underlying reasons are still not fully understood. In this paper, we identify one cause of overfitting related to current practices of generating adversarial examples from misclassified samples. We show that, following current practice, adversarial examples from misclassified samples results in harder-to-classify samples than the original ones. This leads to a complex adjustment of the decision boundary during training and hence overfitting. To mitigate this issue, we propose A3T, an accuracy aware AT method that generate adversarial example differently for misclassified and correctly classified samples. We show that our approach achieves better generalization while maintaining comparable robustness to state-of-the-art AT methods on a wide range of computer vision, natural language processing, and tabular tasks.

AB The recognition of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has been an important research field in Brain-computer interface. The semi-supervised classification can improve the classification performance of EEG. Formative Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) uses the affinity matrix between samples and Expectation-maximization (EM) to mine hidden features between samples. It isn't effective to apply FSSL to EEG classification directly due to the non-stationary and nonlinear of EEG. FSSL only uses Euclidean distances in the affinity matrix, which is not sufficient to process EEG signals and may restrict the effect of subsequent feature extraction. In response to this problem, combined model formative Semi-Supervised Learning (CMFSSL) was proposed to construct a combined model based on Euclidean metric and Riemannian metric. The weight update strategy is designed to constrain the model in the EM algorithm, and the weights of the combined model are constantly adjusted to construct a better basic model. Then the hidden features extracted based on the combined model are used to construct the training set and the Broad Learning System is used for classification. The algorithm is verified on three BCI data sets and compared with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the algorithm achieves better results on three data sets: 74.86%, 73.52%, 75.49% and has a good effect on cross-domain classification. The combined model uses adaptive weights to build a better data model for subsequent hidden features, which not only maintains the original security advantages, but also improves the classification results.

DE Knowledge enhancement; Entity; Entity description
AB Several studies have focused on incorporating language models with entity descriptions to facilitate the model with a better understanding of knowledge. Existing methods usually either integrate descriptions in the pre-training stage by designing description-related tasks, or in the fine-tuning stage by directly appending description strings to the original input, this paper falls into the latter group. We separate entity descriptions from the original text and process them by another lighter module. Specifically, we use the original large model to encode the original input, while the lighter module processes the entity descriptions. We also propose a layer-wise fusion strategy to deeply couple the representations of the input and descriptions. To further improve the fusion of the two representations, we explore two auxil-iary tasks: the entity-description enhancement task and the entity contrastive task. Experiments on (Open Entity, FIGER, FewRel, TACRED, SST) datasets yield respective improvements of (0.9, 1.4, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3). Utilizing ChatGPT as the description embedding method holds the potential for even more promis-ing results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We explore different strategies to integrate prior domain knowledge into the design of graph neural networks (GNN). Our study is supported by a use-case of estimating the potential energy of chemical systems (molecules and crystals) represented as graphs. We integrate two elements of domain knowledge into the design of the GNN to constrain and regularise its learning, towards higher accuracy and generalisation. First, knowledge on the existence of different types of relations/graph edges (e.g. chemical bonds in our case study) between nodes of the graph is used to modulate their interactions. We formulate and compare two strategies, namely specialised message production and specialised update of internal states. Second, knowledge of the relevance of some physical quantities is used to constrain the learnt features towards a higher physical relevance using a simple multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm. We explore the potential of MTL to better capture the underlying mechanisms behind the studied phenomenon. We demonstrate the general applicability of our two knowledge integrations by applying them to three architectures that rely on different mechanisms to propagate information between nodes and to update node states. Our implementations are made publicly available. To support these experiments, we release three new datasets of out-of-equilibrium molecules and crystals of various complexities.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper shows that time series forecasting Transformer (TSFT) suffers from severe over-fitting problem caused by improper initialization method of unknown decoder inputs, especially when handling non-stationary time series. Based on this observation, we propose GBT, a novel two-stage Transformer framework with Good Beginning. It decouples the prediction process of TSFT into two stages, including Auto-Regression stage and Self-Regression stage to tackle the problem of different statistical properties between input and prediction sequences. Prediction results of Auto-Regression stage serve as a 'Good Beginning', i.e., a better initialization for inputs of Self-Regression stage. We also propose the Error Score Modification module to further enhance the forecasting capability of the SelfRegression stage in GBT. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that GBT outperforms SOTA TSFTs (FEDformer, Pyraformer, ETSformer, etc.) and many other forecasting models (SCINet, N-HiTS, etc.) with only canonical attention and convolution while owning less time and space complexity. It is also general enough to couple with these models to strengthen their forecasting capability. The source code is available at: https://github.com/OrigamiSL/GBT & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB Every day, humans make hundreds of decisions, most of which are based on information we gather from our surroundings. The majority of this perception when it comes to driving is visual. Autonomous vehicles that are capable of recognizing items around them and making quick decisions in response to these impulses are self driving cars. Self-driving cars are the main concern and an emerging subject for every automobile giant in the world. Death due to human failure in a road accident increases with every passing month and with technology assisting humans in every possible field, it is essential to prioritize road safety with it. In a thorough investigation of traffic safety, it was discovered that human error was the sole cause of 57% of accidents and a contributory factor in more than 90% of them. In comparison, only 2.4% of crashes were the result of a mechanical issue, and 4.7% were the result of environmental variables alone. Autonomous cars not only help reduce human errors while driving but also help in reducing driver's fatigue to a greater extent. This study examines the work of a number of scholars in order to provide a quick summary of how computer vision is being used in autonomous cars today. Previous research has shown the use of deep learning algorithms with the help of LiDAR sensors but they come with the problem of being relied on costly hardware. This paper focuses on the vertical and lateral movement of the car while using a more budget friendly yet effective option using just simple computer vision algorithms like Color space transformation, Canny edge detection and Hough line transformation to make the car detect lane lines and steering the car so that it remains bound to them. Simple computer vision requires less operational hardware which indicates that using cost effective boards like Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano can yield much more powerful results. The paper also highlights the reconstruction of a ready-made remote-controlled car that helps understanding autonomous cars even better.

AB Wheel and rail profiles have significant impacts on the vehicle system dynamics. Improper wheel and rail profiles lead to the decay of vehicle dynamics performance, hunting instability and derailment. In this study, we propose a model, stacking feature deep forest, to determine the limit wheel profile for hunting instability using wheel/rail geometric contact parameters. We calculate the critical speed of the vehicles under various wheel and rail profiles and record their wheel/rail geometric contact parameters as samples. Two experiments are conducted. One is the binary classification aiming to identify whether the wheel/rail geometric contact parameters guarantee the vehicle's critical speed is higher than the threshold of its operational speed. The other is the multi-classification to determine the interval of the critical speed. The results show the stacking feature deep forest achieves an accuracy of 85.10% on the test set which is higher than other popular ensemble models. However, all models' accuracy is lower than 70% in multi-classification. The Shapley additive explanations are utilized to enhance the explainability of the stacking feature deep forest. The Shapley additive explanation importance reveals that the equivalent conicity of 1 mm has the most impact on hunting. Its importance is 1.32 times more than the equivalent conicity of 3 mm. Nevertheless, the equivalent conicity of 3 mm is nearly positively correlated to the hunting probability and this characteristic is suitable as a qualitative criterion.

AB As a recent noticeable topic, domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable model on multiple source domains, which is expected to perform well on unseen test domains. Great efforts have been made to learn domain-invariant features by aligning distributions across domains. However, existing works are often designed based on some relaxed conditions which are generally hard to satisfy and fail to realize the desired joint distribution alignment. In this article, we propose a novel domain generalization method, which originates from an intuitive idea that a domain-invariant classifier can be learned by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence between posterior distributions from different domains. To enhance the generalizability of the learned classifier, we formalize the optimization objective as an expectation computed on the ground-truth marginal distribution. Nevertheless, it also presents two obvious deficiencies, one of which is the side-effect of entropy increase in KL-divergence and the other is the unavailability of ground-truth marginal distributions. For the former, we introduce a term named maximum in-domain likelihood to maintain the discrimination of the learned domain-invariant representation space. For the latter, we approximate the ground-truth marginal distribution with source domains under a reasonable convex hull assumption. Finally, a constrained maximum cross-domain likelihood (CMCL) optimization problem is deduced, by solving which the joint distributions are naturally aligned. An alternating optimization strategy is carefully designed to approximately solve this optimization problem. Extensive experiments on four standard benchmark datasets, i.e., Digits-DG, PACS, Office-Home, and miniDomainNet, highlight the superior performance of our method.

AB Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common knee injury that can have serious consequences and require medical intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred method for ACL tear diagnosis. However, manual segmentation of the ACL in MRI images is prone to human error and can be time-consuming. This study presents a new approach that uses deep learning technique for localizing the ACL tear region in MRI images. The proposed multi-scale guided attention-based context aggregation (MGACA) method applies attention mechanisms at different scales within the DeepLabv3+ architecture to aggregate context information and achieve enhanced localization results. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 917 knee MRI images, resulting in 15265 slices, obtaining state-of-the-art results with accuracy scores of 98.63%, intersection over union (IOU) scores of 95.39%, Dice coefficient scores (DCS) of 97.64%, recall scores of 97.5%, precision scores of 98.21%, and F1 Scores of 97.86% on validation set data. Moreover, our method performed well in terms of loss values, with binary cross entropy combined with Dice loss (BCE_Dice_loss) and Dice_loss values of 0.0564 and 0.0236, respectively, on the validation set. The findings suggest that MGACA provides an accurate and efficient solution for automating the localization of ACL in knee MRI images, surpassing other state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and loss values. However, in order to improve robustness of the approach and assess its performance on larger data sets, further research is needed.

AB In this article, we present a parameterized Colored Petri Net (CPN) model of the IEEE 802.11e protocol for wireless communications with mobile stations. CPNs provide a graphical model for the modeling and analysis of concurrent systems, which can be parameterized by the use of constants, and thus they allow us to create more flexible models. Our CPN model captures the protocol's behavior, and the specific parameters used for the 802.11e protocol and the scenarios to be evaluated are captured by the CPN parameters. The model presented is flexible enough to cover full customization of traffic types, user mobility and collision avoidance protocols. In this model, there is an access point (AP) which is visible to all the stations, and we assume that due to physical restrictions, there are two range groups. All the stations in the same range group are visible to each other. The impact of mobility is then analyzed by studying a situation in which the stations move in a controlled way to the same range group. The simulation results demonstrate the impact on network performance for sensitive and insensitive traffic types, as well as the role of the RTS/CTS protocol in collision avoidance, especially when users are located in different regions. Specifically, we show how the performance improves in the different scenarios when the stations move to the same area, where they can see each other, and we also study the impact on the performance for each type of traffic.

AB Recently, segmentation-based approaches have been proposed to tackle arbitrary-shaped text detection. The trade-off between speed and accuracy is still a challenge that hinders its deployment in practical applications. Previous methods adopt complex pipelines to improve accuracy while ignoring inference speed. Moreover, the performance of most efficient scene text detectors often suffers from weak feature extraction when equipping lightweight networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distillation method for efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection, termed kernel-mask knowledge distillation. Our approach equips a low computational-cost visual transformer module (VTM) and a feature adaptation layer to make full use of feature based and response-based knowledge in distillation. More specifically, first, the text features are obtained by aggregating the multi-level information extracted in the respective backbones of the teacher and student networks. Second, the text features are respectively sent to the VTM to enhance the feature representation ability. Then, we distill the feature-based and response based kernel knowledge of the teacher network to obtain an efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detection model. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. It is worth noting that our method can achieve a competitive F-measure of 86.92% at 34.5 FPS on Total-text. Code is available at https:// github.com/giganticpower/KKDnet.

AB Due to the barriers of finance, talent, and technology, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have faced uncertainty and risks if they fail to engage in digital transformation (DT). A good choice is for SMEs to choose solutions already on the market, provided by professional DT solutions suppliers. However, how to choose the most suitable DT solution remains a major challenge for SMEs. Thus, to help SMEs to select an appropriate DT solution, we proposed a novel, prospect theory-based evidential reasoning (ER) assessment method under a hesitant picture fuzzy linguistic sets (HPFLSs) environment. First, the novel distance measures of picture fuzzy sets (PFSs) and HPFLSs are proposed, then, based on the proposed distance measures of HPFLSs, novel, prospect theory formula are constructed. Additionally, a novel HPFLS ER method was developed to aggregate the evaluation information. Afterward, an assessment and selection decision approach for DT solutions for SMEs, based on the prospect theory-based ER of HPFLSs, was conducted. Finally, actual examples of DT solutions for SMEs to illustrate the decision-making approach were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the conclusions were summarized.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Detail fidelity; recurrent structure preservation; single image
   super-resolution (SISR); wavelet pyramid
AB Many single image super-resolution (SISR) methods that use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learn the relationship between low-and high-resolution images directly, without considering the context structure and detail fidelity. This can limit the potential of CNNs and result in unrealistic, distorted edges and textures in the reconstructed images. A more effective approach is to incorporate prior knowledge about the image into the model to aid in image reconstruction. In this study, we propose a novel recurrent structure-preserving mechanism that innovatively uses the multiscale wavelet transform (WT) as an image prior, namely, wavelet pyramid recurrent structure-preserving attention network (WRSANet), to process both low-and high-frequency subnetworks at each level separately and recursively. We propose a novel structure scale preservation (SSP) architecture that differs from traditional WTs. This architecture allows us to incorporate and learn structure preservation subnetworks at each level. By using our proposed structure scale fusion (SSF) combined with inverse WT, we can recursively restore and preserve rich low-frequency image structure through the combination of SSP at various levels. Furthermore, we also propose novel low-to-high-frequency information transmission (L2HIT) and detail enhancement (DE) mechanisms to address the issue of detail distortion in high-frequency images by transferring information from structure preservation subnetworks. This allows us to preserve the low-frequency structure while reconstructing high-frequency details, improving detail fidelity and avoiding structural distortion. Finally, a joint loss function is also used to balance the fusion of low-and high-frequency information at different degrees, with hyperparameters being adjusted during training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WRSANet achieves better performance and visual presentation than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on synthetic and real datasets, especially in terms of context structure and texture details.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Predictive learning is receiving growing interests with wide applications. Combining RNN and CNN, recent works attempt to capture temporal dependencies and spatial correlations simultaneously. However, these methods tend to be deeper networks without feature compression in scale and easily suffer from high computational costs, especially for high-resolution frames. To reduce resource burden, we introduce a novel and efficient network named CASTnet for spatiotemporal predictive learning. In this paper, we present a concise architecture cascading multiple stages, which can directly accept the raw frames without information loss in the first stage and compress features in the following stages leading to low computation relatively. Then, we adopt a special prediction head to aggregate multi-level features into predictions, which helps our model capture multi-scale targets. As for the spatiotemporal block, we adopt bidirectional convolutional attention (BCA) operations to capture the local and long-range information simultaneously without quadratic calculation complexity. In order to further improve the model performance while not causing much additional computation burden, we propose frame-wise knowledge distillation, which enables each frame at low-level to learn from each one at high-level. To evaluate our model, we conduct quantitative qualitative and ablation experiments on the MovingMNIST and Radar Echo datasets. The results show that our CASTnet achieves competitive results with lower computational costs and fewer network parameters than the state-of-the-art models.

AB Recently, event cameras, as a new generation of bionic cameras with characteristics of high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, provide a brand new competitive modal for multi-modal tracking. However, recent works on RGBE tracking pay too much attention to utilizing the complementary information while ignoring to enhance the modality-shared information and the global relations inside and across modalities. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end full attention tracker named Swin Transformer Event Frame Tracker (SwinEFT) to fully explore both modality-specific and modality-shared information. To be specific, we firstly adopt a simple but effective event representation to narrow the domain gap as well as obtain a clearer tracking target. With the deployment of shifted window based attention mechanism, our tracker is better able to leverage the global relations, resulting in locating a more accurate bounding box. Besides, in order to enhance the modality-shared information, we design Swin Decoder by introducing cross-attention based on shifted windows for information interaction. Extended experiments on two realistic RGBE tracking datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance and robustness of SwinEFT against the state-of-the-art methods under various challenging scenarios.

   Lightweight network; Convolution-free feature extraction
AB The accuracy of detecting and classifying surface-mounted devices (SMDs) on printed circuit boards (PCBs) is influenced by the complexity of the background and the variations in scale among the SMDs. Several object detection networks, such as the you only look once (YOLO) series-based networks and two-stage models like Mask R-CNN, have been developed to handle the detection of surface-mounted devices (SMDs) at various scales. However, the majority of these networks exhibit a complex structure with an abundance of parameters, which presents difficulties in deploying SMD detection networks in real-world application scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we introduce SD2Net, a convolution-free attention-based network specifically designed for accurate SMD detection. The front-end of SD2Net employs the proposed pyramid vision transformer (PVT) block-based backbone to extract SMD features in five stages, incorporating an attention mechanism. Subsequently, the extracted multi-scale features are fed into the feature pyramid network (FPN) for efficient feature fusion. In the back-end of SD2Net, the final stage integrates the VarifocalNet head module (VFH). By utilizing the Varifocal loss and generalized intersection over union (GIoU), it performs precise regression and computation of the localization and class mapping vector for SMDs. We conduct extensive experiments using two well-established publicly available datasets: FICS-PCB and PCB-WACV. The experimental results indicate the superior performance of our model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Automated machine learning (AutoML) has been developed for automatically building effective machine learning pipelines. However, existing AutoML frameworks use a single individual pipeline or a weighted ensemble of several pipelines to create the final predictive model, which ignores the difference between the unseen instances and leads to undesirable performance. To construct customized models for different unseen instances, we propose a novel AutoML method based on dynamic ensemble selection of machine learning pipelines, where the most competent combination of base pipelines is selected and aggregated to predict a specific unseen instance. First, an effective base pipeline pool is generated by filtering out the underperforming pipelines. Second, when an unseen instance appears, we deploy a new dynamic balanced accuracy criterion to select the most competent ensemble of base pipelines according to its local region. Finally, the outputs of the selected pipelines are integrated to give the final prediction. Comprehensive experiments on 39 publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to some state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks.

AB In Smart Energy Grids, the information flow used to make decisions is the result of fusion of different sources. Communication latency, possible sensor faults and inaccuracies, may negatively impact the data quality and hence the taken decisions. For these reasons, the construction of a robust representation of the input signals that replaces and/or corrects the inaccurate data is crucial for effective classification, anomaly detection and planning. Recent works on Data Fusion and data imputation suggest that the usage of other signals in the same context can empower the representation and can be a useful preprocessing task. In this work we describe an Autoencoder-based data fusion architecture with convolutional layers, skip connections and ad-hoc augmented training sets for data imputation applied to the power consumption measurements obtained by different sub-meters. Among the investigated architectures, the approach with the shared convolutional layers and an augmented dataset that consider missing data in the random positions and located in the central part (AE-A-ALL-CNN), is the most promising one. In presence of one half of the input signal, in the central part, completely erased, it improves the imputation capability, respect to two most employed approaches (denoising autoencoder and MICE) in the average of 12 %.

   Autoencoder; Geometric transformation
AB Anomalies (or outliers) indicate a minority of data items that are quite different from the majority (inliers) of a dataset in a certain aspect. Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) is an important but not yet extensively studied research topic. Recent deep learning based methods exploit the reconstruction gap between inliers and outliers to discriminate them. However, it is observed that the reconstruction gap often decreases rapidly as the training process goes. And there is no reasonable way to set the training stop point. To support effective UAD, we propose a new UAD framework by introducing a Latent Feature Reconstruction (LFR) layer that can be applied to recent UAD methods. The LFR layer acts as a regularizer to constrain the latent features in a low-rank subspace from which inliers can be reconstructed well while outliers cannot. We develop two new UAD methods by implementing the proposed framework with autoencoder architecture and geometric transformation scheme. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our proposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases.

AB The classical ID3 decision tree algorithm cannot directly handle continuous data and has a poor classification effect. Moreover, most of the existing approaches use a single mechanism for node measurement, which is unfavorable for the construction of decision trees. In order to solve the above problems, we propose an improved ID3 algorithm (called DIGGI) based on variable precision neighborhood rough sets. First, we introduce the notions of variable precision neighborhood (VPN) equivalence relation and VPN equivalence granule, and probe some basic properties of these notions. Second, we give the model of VPN rough sets and propose two extended measures: the VPN information gain and the VPN Gini index. Finally, we construct a hybrid measure by using the VPN dependence to combine the above two extended measures, and adopt the VPN equivalence granule as the splitting rule of DIGGI. Experimental results show that DIGGI is effective and its accuracy is greatly improved compared with three traditional decision tree algorithms, the neighborhood decision tree (NDT) and variable precision neighborhood decision tree (VPNDT) proposed in the latest literature.

AB Due to the fantastic ability to capture consistent and complementary information between views, multi-view graph clustering has attracted extensive research attention. However, multi-view data are mostly high-dimensional, which may contain many redundant and irrelevant features. At the same time, the original data are usually contaminated by noise and outliers, which may destroy the intrinsic structural information of data and reduce the reliability of the affinity matrix learned. Moreover, most models assign different weights to each view to fully consider the relation between views. The intrinsic information of some views cannot be fully utilized due to the small view weights assigned to them. To deal with these problems, in this study, we propose a robust multi-view clustering model by combining low-dimensional and low-rank latent space learning, self-representation learning, and multi-view discrepancy induction fusion into a unified framework. Specifically, the original high-dimensional data is first reconstructed in a low-dimensional and low-rank space. A self-representation learning method is used to learn the reliable affinity matrix for each view. Furthermore, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion is used as a discrepancy induction module for the complementary fusion of views. Finally, to preserve the data's local geometric structure, a simple adaptive graph regularization term is applied to the affinity matrix for each view. The comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets validate that the proposed model outperforms the six state-of-the-art comparison models in robustness and clustering performance.

AB This study examines an optimal pricing policy for managing deteriorating products in a stochastic inventory system. Customer arrival is formulated as a Poisson process with a fixed rate, and customer demand is probabilistically expressed based on the valuation of the product. Typically, customer interest in items decreases over time because of the declining quality of deteriorating products. A dynamic pricing policy is needed to increase retailer profitability under stochastic scenarios. This paper combines the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach to realize an optimal solution for the dynamic pricing strategy with specific boundaries using an analytical approach. Furthermore, an artificial intelligence-based High-Order Neural Network (HONN) model is implemented as an intelligent strategy to approximate the complex dynamic behaviors of the stochastic inventory system. The present study aims to fill the research gap by comparing the analytical solution obtained from the hybrid optimization using HJB-PSO and the intelligent strategy obtained from the HONN model. The proposed approaches bring greater accuracy and efficiency to inventory management tools. The performance difference between the proposed algorithms indicates that the error does not exceed the desired limit (<= 1%), indicating that the analytical and numerical solutions found can be used interchangeably in practice. Furthermore, all validation tests ensure that the proposed decision support system can aid policymakers in managing stochastic inventory systems with minimal effort and adopting strategies to ensure resilience and customer satisfaction.

TI Boosting deep cross-modal retrieval hashing with adversarially robust

AB Deep hashing methods effectively enhance the performance of conventional machine learning retrieval models, particularly in visual medium evolving cross-modal retrieval tasks, by relying on the outstanding feature extraction ability of deep neural networks (DNNs). The state-of-the-art deep hashing research focuses on designing prominent models by employing DNNs to discover semantic information from different modalities of data and execute relevant information retrieval tasks. However, the robustness attribute considered essential for reliable DNN model design has limited concerns on deep hashing models. In this article, we present an end-to-end adversarial training framework for cross-modal retrieval. Our framework leverages a projected gradient descent(PGD)-based method to generate adversarial samples, which are then combined with normal samples to achieve robust training. Our approach addresses the vulnerability issues of existing cross-modal retrieval models and fills the gap in retrieval task design. We conduct extensive experiments and compare our model with state-of-the-art cross-modal retrieval models on three benchmark datasets to verify that our model can effectively boost the performance of deep hashing retrieval models on cross-modal retrieval . This work highlights the effectiveness of adversarial training in efficient deep hashing model design.

AB Six-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) object pose estimation is a critical task for robot manipulation, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. Category-level 6DoF object pose estimation is trending because it can generalize to same-category unknown objects. However, existing mean shape based methods do not consider that predicting adjustment must model shape differences, which makes these methods still suffer from shape variations among same-category objects, limiting their accuracy. Also, existing methods overlook the importance of object segmentation to 6DoF pose estimation and use an RGB-based object segmentation method with low accuracy. To address these problems, we propose difference-aware shape adjustment and RGB-D feature fusion-based object segmentation for category-level 6DoF object pose estimation. The proposed method encodes shape differences, improving mean shape adjustment and alleviating same-category shape variations. Specifically, a difference-aware shape adjustment network (DASAN) is proposed to model shape differences between the object instance and mean shape by feature subtraction with an attention mechanism. We also propose an RGB-D feature fusion-based object segmentation method that uses a coarse-to-fine framework: a 2D detector and a novel RGB-D feature fusion-based binary classification network for coarse and fine segmentation. Experiments on two well-known datasets demonstrate the proposed method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estimation accuracy. In addition, we construct comparative experiments on the latest dataset (Wild6D) and a self-collected dataset (OBJECTS) and achieve high accuracies, demonstrating the strong generalizability of the proposed method. Also, we apply the proposed method to unknown object grasping, thus demonstrating the practicability of the proposed method.

TI A DNN Framework for Learning Lagrangian Drift With Uncertainty

DE Uncertainty representations; Pixel-wise regression; Flow modelling; CNN;
   Physical science; Lagrangian drift
AB Reconstructions of Lagrangian drift, for example for objects lost at sea, are often uncertain due to unresolved physical phenomena within the data. Uncertainty is usually overcome by introducing stochasticity into the drift, but this approach requires specific assumptions for modelling uncertainty. We remove this constraint by presenting a purely data-driven framework for modelling probabilistic drift in flexible environments. Using ocean circulation model simulations, we generate probabilistic trajectories of object location by simulating uncertainty in the initial object position. We train an emulator of probabilistic drift over one day given perfectly known velocities and observe good agreement with numerical simulations. Several loss functions are tested. Then, we strain our framework by training models where the input information is imperfect. On these harder scenarios, we observe reasonable predictions although the effects of data drift become noticeable when evaluating the models against unseen flow scenarios.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Graph neural network; Graph augmentation; Topology features;

AB The complexity and non-Euclidean structure of graph data hinders the development of data augmentation methods similar to those in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a feature augmentation method for graph nodes based on topological regularization, in which topological structure information is introduced into an end-to-end model to promote better learning of node representation. Specifically, we first obtain topology embedding of nodes through Node2vec, an unsupervised graph feature learning method based on random walk. Then, the topological embedding as additional features and the original node features are input into a Symmetric Graph Neural Network framework for propagation, and two different high-order neighborhood representations of the nodes are obtained. On this basis, we propose a regularization technique to bridge the differences between the two different node representations, eliminate the adverse effects caused by the topological features of graphs directly used, and greatly improve the performance. Our framework can be effectively combined with other graph neural network models, and can effectively prevent over-smoothing of deep graph network. Experimental results on five datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.

AB Nowadays, biometric systems have emerged as a powerful tool for personal identification. Advanced research with significant results has been provided. Despite the important progress, there is a big need for improvement in the performance of security applications. More recently, an Autonomous Learning Multi-Model Classifier of 0- Order (ALMMo-0) has been proposed as a universal efficient tool of classification, autonomous, non-iterative, and fully explainable solving the problem of supervised pattern recognition. Thereby, our aim with this paper is to propose a new efficient methodology based on the ALMMo-0 classifier for authentication systems exploiting face modality. The proposed methodology is entirely data-driven, non-iterative, and feedforward. The proposed approach extracts the most relevant features from the face image by the Gabor filter bank descriptor, which is then fed into the ALMMo-0 classifier that extracts automatically the data clouds and builds its multimodal structure, forms its AnYa Fuzzy rule base (FRB) sub-classifiers for each class, generating objectively the score of confidence based on the mutual distribution then classify the new data using "winner takes all" strategy, as a result, the system decides whether the person is genuine or an imposter. Strong evidence of ALMMo-0 was found when experiments were conducted on nine face databases. Results were presented in the form of rank-1, equal error rate (EER), cumulative match curve (CMC), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Furthermore, to provide more valuable information about our proposed system, results were also presented in the form of True Positive Rate (TPR) or the Genuine Acceptance Rate ( GAR). The results demonstrated high performance of the proposed approach with not just a low error rate (EER) of 0.0% and a high accuracy (rank- 1) of 100% but also high explainability and low computational complexity.

AB This paper presents a novel (PIIDD mu 2)-I-lambda 1-D-lambda 2-D-mu 1 controller for the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) system. The AVR system controls the terminal voltage of synchronous generators. In this way, it contributes to voltage stability in power systems. The parameters of the proposed controller are optimized with the recently developed Mayfly algorithm for various objective functions. These objective functions are Zwe-Lee Gaing, the integral of time multiplied absolute error, the integral of squared error, the integral of time multiplied squared error and the integral of absolute error (IAE). The best result in terms of transient response parameters (settling time, rise time, and maximum overshoot) at terminal voltage is compared to controllers developed in recent years. Both time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis is used in this comparison. From the comparison results, it has been observed that the proposed controller provided better performance as compared to existing controllers in the literature. In addition to time and frequency domain analysis, robustness, nonlinear effect, and external disturbance rejection performances of the proposed controller are analyzed for the AVR system. As a result of all these analyses, it is seen that the proposed controller displays outstanding performance.

AB We live in an age where the use of smart devices and Internet are redefining our community standards. Additionally, the pandemic Covid-19 enforced the community to use applications on smart devices for various activities. Currently, many organizations are developing their applications that are accessible through various platforms, including Windows Phone Store, Apple App Store, and Google Play. To facilitate the customer the banking sector is also providing their mobile applications for various online services. Mobile banking applications (mbanking apps) have considerably upgraded the efficiency of the banks and living standards of the people. The people can easily download applications from app stores and are permitted to leave reviews or comments on the mobile application. The sentiment analysis is an area that allows us to examine the user opinion to improve the online services. Therefore, for any organization it is of prime importance to explore and evaluate the weaknesses affecting the delivery of their online services. In this work, sentiment analysis is performed to evaluate ten (10) mbanking apps of Pakistan using valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning and machine learning (ML) based approaches. Performance of three classifiers through supervised ML techniques multinomial Naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine, and ensemble model is compared and employed. Moreover, the thematic analysis of reviews is also performed to discover various factors as themes that affect the effectiveness of the mbanking apps by using Top2Vec Model. The results indicate that the ensemble model is best performing model with f1-score of 90%. The thematical analysis uncovers 346 positive themes like ease of use, helpful, reliable, user friendly, good aesthetics, convenience, secured and many more, whereas 441 negative themes comprise performance issue, poor updates/new version in apps, account registration issue, app crash problem, etc.

However, mobile manipulators, especially quadruped manipulators, are relatively novel systems to be implemented in the industry compared to traditional machinery. Consequently, no standardized interface evaluation method has been established for them. The proposed scheme is the first of its kind in evaluating mobile manipulator teleoperation. It comprises a set of robot motion tests, objective measures, subjective measures, and a prediction model to provide a comprehensive evaluation. The motion tests encompass locomotion, manipulation, and a combined test. The duration for each trial is collected as the response variable in the objective measure. Statistical tools, including mean value, standard deviation, and T-test, are utilized to cross-compare between different predictor variables. Based on an extended Fitts' law, the prediction model employs the time and mission difficulty index to forecast system performance in future missions. The subjective measures utilize the NASA-task load index and the system usability scale to assess workload and usability. Finally, the proposed scheme is implemented on a real-world quadruped manipulator with two widely-used HRTIs, the gamepad and the wearable motion capture system.

AB Contrastive learning (CL) is a prominent technique for self-supervised representation learning, which aims to contrast semantically similar (i.e., positive) and dissimilar (i.e., negative) pairs of examples under different augmented views. Recently, CL has provided unprecedented potential for learning expressive graph representations without external supervision. In graph CL, the negative nodes are typically uniformly sampled from augmented views to formulate the contrastive objective. However, this uniform negative sampling strategy limits the expressive power of contrastive models. To be specific, not all the negative nodes can provide sufficiently meaningful knowledge for effective contrastive representation learning. In addition, the negative nodes that are semantically similar to the anchor are undesirably repelled from it, leading to degraded model performance. To address these limitations, in this article, we devise an adaptive sampling strategy termed "AdaS." The proposed AdaS framework can be trained to adaptively encode the importance of different negative nodes, so as to encourage learning from the most informative graph nodes. Meanwhile, an auxiliary polarization regularizer is proposed to suppress the adverse impacts of the false negatives and enhance the discrimination ability of AdaS. The experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets firmly verify the effectiveness of our AdaS in improving the performance of graph CL.

AB Accurately extracting buildings from aerial images has essential research significance for timely understanding human intervention on the land. The distribution discrepancies between diversified unlabeled remote sensing images (changes in imaging sensor, location, and environment) and labeled historical images significantly degrade the generalization performance of deep learning algorithms. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms have recently been proposed to eliminate the distribution discrepancies without re-annotating training data for new domains. Nevertheless, due to the limited information provided by a single-source domain, single-source UDA (SSUDA) is not an optimal choice when multitemporal and multiregion remote sensing images are available. We propose a multisource UDA (MSUDA) framework SPENet for building extraction, aiming at selecting, purifying, and exchanging information from multisource domains to better adapt the model to the target domain. Specifically, the framework effectively utilizes richer knowledge by extracting target-relevant information from multiple-source domains, purifying target domain information with low-level features of buildings, and exchanging target domain information in an interactive learning manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies constructed on 12 city datasets prove the effectiveness of our method against existing state-ofthe-art methods, e.g., our method achieves 59.1% intersection over union (IoU) on Austin and Kitsap ? Potsdam, which surpasses the target domain supervised method by 2.2%. The code is available at https://github.com/QZangXDU/SPENet.

DE Complementarity learning; consistency; graph fusion; graph-based
   multiview clustering; inconsistency
ID SELF-REPRESENTATION; LOW-RANK
AB In real scenarios, graph-based multiview clustering has clearly shown popularity owing to the high efficiency in fusing the information from multiple views. Practically, the multiview graphs offer both consistent and inconsistent cues as they usually come from heterogeneous sources. Previous methods illustrated the importance of leveraging the multiview consistency and inconsistency for accurate modeling. However, when fusing the graphs, the inconsistent parts are generally ignored and hence the valued view-specific attributes are lost. To solve this problem, we propose an accurate complementarity learning (ACL) model for graph-based multiview clustering. ACL clearly distinguishes the consistent, complementary, and noise and corruption terms from the initial multiview graphs. In contrast to existing models that overlooked the complementary information, we argue that the view-specific characteristics extracted from the complementary terms are beneficial for affinity learning. In addition, ACL exploits only the positive parts of the complementary information for preserving the evidence on the positive sample relationship, and ignores the negative cues to avoid the vanishing of effective affinity strengths. This way, the learned affinity matrix is able to properly balance the consistent and complementary information. To solve the ACL model, we introduce an efficient alternating optimization algorithm with a varying penalty parameter. Experiments on synthetic and real-world databases clearly demonstrated the superiority of ACL.

AB This study develops a research model to explain the acceptance of social banking. In order to find the antecedents of social banking intention, a meta-combination has been used. The results of a systematic review of the last decade of social commerce acceptance studies and the use of fuzzy Delphi and fuzzy DEMATEL methods led to the development of the model. The obtained model was investigated by the partial least squares method in the statistical community of banking customers. Then, by analyzing intermediate variables, the final results were obtained. Based on the obtained model, three types of effects were investigated: direct effects with the presence of the mediating factor or factors, direct effects by removing the mediating factor or factors, and indirect effect by considering the mediating factor or factors. The results show that except for privacy considerations, other factors including trust, attitude, social support, social commerce constructs, word of mouth, social influence, customer social responsibility and perceived usefulness have a direct and indirect effect on social banking intention. The privacy consideration factor has only indirect effect on social banking intention through the full mediation of the trust factor. Except for the effect of factors on the intention of social banking, based on the model obtained from meta-combination, the effect of factors on each other was also investigated and some were confirmed. This research introduces a socio-technical innovation by combining the application of social banking with a social commerce platform and presents a comprehensive model of the willingness to accept this innovation.

AB This work addresses the output reachable set-based leader-following consensus problem, focusing on a group of pos-itive agents over directed dwell-time switching networks. Two types of non-negative disturbances, namely, 1) L1-norm bounded disturbances and 2) L8,1-norm bounded disturbances are stud-ied. Meanwhile, a class of directed dwell-time switching networks for modeling the communication protocol of positive agents is investigated. To deal with the presence of disturbances, an output-feedback control protocol is developed to achieve a robust consensus with positivity preserved based on the output reach-able set. By exploiting the positive characteristics, switched linear copositive Lyapunov functions are adopted to establish out-put reachable set-based consensus conditions. These conditions can facilitate the control protocol design by solving a bilin-ear programming problem, and also generate hyperpyramidal regions to confine the output consensus error. A particle swarm optimization-based (PSO-based) algorithm is applied to compute the controller gains and optimize the volume of the hyper-pyramids. The proposed methods are verified by the presented numerical case studies.

AB The progress of deep learning architectures, machine learning models and pathology slide digitization is an encouraging step toward meeting the growing demand for more precise classification and prediction diagnosis for the breast tumours. The BreakHis dataset with four magnification factors (40X, 100X, 200X and 400X), as well as seven deep learning architectures used for feature extraction (DenseNet 201, Inception ResNet V2, Inception V3, ResNet 50, MobileNet V2,VGG16 and VGG19), four machine learning models for classification (MLP, SVM, DT, and KNN), and two combination rules (hard and weighted voting) were investigated in this paper to design and evaluate a new proposed approach consisting of building deep hybrid homogenous ensemble. Additionally, the best proposed models were compared to deep stacked, deep bagging, deep boosting, and deep hybrid heterogenous ensemble to choose the best strategy in building deep ensemble learning techniques. The four performance measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used in the empirical evaluations, as well as 5-fold cross-validation, the Scott Knott statistical test, and the Borda Count voting method. The results demonstrated the new approach's potential since it outscored both singles and other deep ensemble learning strategies, achieving accuracy values of 98.3% and 97.7% for the MFs 40X, 100X and 200X, 400X, respectively. The empirical results demonstrated that the proposed ensembles are impactful for histopathological breast cancer images classification, and they provided a promising tool to assist pathologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

AB Colonoscopy is a common method for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). The segmentation of colonoscopy imagery is valuable for examining the lesion. However, as colonic polyps have various sizes and shapes, and their morphological characteristics are similar to those of mucosa, it is difficult to segment them accurately. To address this, a novel neural network architecture called CrossFormer is proposed. CrossFormer combines cross-attention and multi-scale methods, which can achieve high-precision automatic segmentation of the polyps. A multi-scale cross-attention module is proposed to enhance the ability to extract context information and learn different features. In addition, a novel channel enhancement module is used to focus on the useful channel information. The model is trained and tested on the Kvasir and CVC-ClinicDB datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms most existing polyps segmentation methods.

AB Instance retrieval is concerned with obtaining representations of instances (objects) in images and using them for similarity comparisons between instances. However, most methods require instance-level categories to train the model, which increases the burden of annotation. Along with the advancement of convolutional neural networks and transformers in computer vision, in this work, we propose a hierarchical with a spatial pyramidal structure for weakly supervised multi-instance hash learning. It merges the advantages of local and multi-scale perception on CNN with the global field of view on Transformer. Further, it leverages the principle of multi-instance learning, allowing the proposed model to implement an instance-level hash mapping capability in a weakly supervised learning manner. The experimental results on three public datasets achieved more improved results compared to the typical methods, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Many kinds of information entropy are employed for feature selection, but they lack corresponding probabilities to interpret; Despite many statistical indicators utilized in feature selection, neither probability nor mathematical expectation was applied to perform feature selection directly. To address such two problems, this article redefines three kinds of probabilities and their corresponding mathematical expectations from the perspective of granular computing and investigates their properties. These novel probabilities and mathematical expectations extend the meanings of classical probability and mathematical expectation and provide statistical interpretation for their corresponding information entropy, and then, attribute reducts based on probabilities and mathematical expectations are defined, which are proved to be equivalent to those based on their corresponding information entropy. A framework of feature selection algorithms based on probabilities and mathematical expectations (ARME) is designed after the presentation of their properties. Moreover, a novel definition form for feature selection is proposed, and another feature selection algorithm based on the mathematical expectation of conditional probability (ARMEC) is designed to reduce negative features on classification. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that probabilities and mathematical expectations have super efficiency than their corresponding information entropy when they are considered as criteria of feature selection. Therefore, the novel method has the advantage over many state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Semantics in natural language processing is largely dependent on contextual relationships between words and entities in a document collection. The context of a word may evolve. For example, the word "apple" currently has two contexts-a fruit and a technology company. The changes in the context of words or entities in text data such as scientific publications and news articles can help us understand the evolution of innovation or events of interest. In this work, we present a new diffusion-based temporal word embedding model that can capture short- and long-term changes in the semantics of entities in different domains. Our model captures how the context of each entity shifts over time. Existing temporal word embeddings capture semantic evolution at a discrete/granular level, aiming to study how a language developed over a long period. Unlike existing temporal embedding methods, our approach provides temporally smooth embeddings, facilitating prediction and trend analysis better than those of existing models. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proposed temporal embedding model performs better in sense-making and predicting relationships between words and entities in the future compared to other existing models.

AB Many businesses benefit from the business-to-business (B2B) campaign recommendation strategy. Complex commodities and user profiles restrict the performance of automated B2B marketing recommendations to business owners. The existing solutions supplied B2B marketing campaign solutions without accounting for social and ambiguous preferences, limiting the accuracy of B2B marketing campaign recommendations. It motivates us to propose a novel model to improve the performances further. To achieve accurate and fast B2B marketing campaign recommendations, we design a novel approach consisting of social context-aware (SCA), fuzzy preference (FP), personalized temporal graph (PTG), and low-rank graph reconstruction (LRGR). The proposed SCA-FTL approach consolidates the social and fuzzy preferences for accurate recommendations. The main steps of the SCA-FTL model are pre-processing, preference modeling, and automatic recommendations. Pre-processing removes noise and artifacts to improve suggestion accuracy. The hybrid preference extraction uses FP-PTG and LRGR. PF-PTG describes each client's purchasing strategy using a fuzzy methodology to solve ambiguous/vague tailored preferences. Mixing FP-PTG with social context helps derive customer preferences. SCA-FT gets each customer's preferences using the fuzzy temporal graph and social context. LRGR discovers unobserved edges in SCA-FT to increase recommendation predictability. SCA-FT-LRGR findings provide B2B marketing ideas. The results of the experiments reveal that the proposed model recommended B2B marketing campaigns with improved accuracy and minimum computing requirements than the existing solutions. Compared to existing methods, overall recommendation accuracy improves by 25.23%, and recommendation time decreases by 8.46%.

The accessing the web becomes barrier and difficulty ratings remained computed. ANOVA and Tukey's HSD remained recycled to detect alterations between centuries for overall positions. ANOVA repeat measurements were utilized to analyze changes in the US government websites, and Pearson's connection factor (r) was calculated toward assess the connection among convenience and difficulty. Arbitrary webpages gradually develop unreachable as difficulty rises. The complexity of the US government websites is increasing while they are still accessible through fuzzy classifier. It is not necessary for increasing complexity, which is frequently brought on by adding complicated components to a Web page, to result in greater accessibility hurdles reducing the use of scripts in webpage design will increase complexity.

AB In order to reduce cross-infections during epidemics such as COVID-19, it is valuable to design a campus takeout system of intelligent self-pickup cabinets (ISPCs). This research aims to design such a system by optimizing the sites of cabinets, their capacity types, and the location-allocation scheme. In view of maximizing profits of the system, we formulate this design problem as a zero-one integer nonlinear programming model, where the demand of takeout is distance dependent and congestion dependent, rather than a fixed constant. On the basis of model property analysis, the original model is transformed into an integer linear programming problem such that it is solved by off-the-shelf solvers. By case study and sensitivity analyses, it is found that: The proposed method is valuable for providing an optimal strategy for a takeout system of ISPCs by optimizing the sites of the cabinets, the capacity types and the location-allocation strategy; With the optimal strategy derived from the proposed model and algorithm, the developed system is more applicable in the areas of intensively distributed users or the areas closer to canteens in view of creating significant effects of scale economy; For the groups of consumers with different distance-dependent or congestion-dependent sensitivities, it is suggested to implement distinct optimal strategies of building the takeout system even for those in the same service area; The takeout demand grows up with an increasing unit selling price in the developed system, rather than reduction as in an ordinary relation between the demand of products and the price. Thus, the designed self-pickup takeout system seems more applicable to be adopted for the high-quality takeout.

ID PASSENGER FLOW
AB In recent years, most cities in China have started operating rail transit, but rail transit is mostly located underground and in relatively closed locations. When safety incidents occur, it will cause great safety hazards. Therefore, rail safety operation is very important. With the rapid growth of China's economy and society, as well as the continuous advancement of urbanization, the development speed of rail transit is becoming faster and more important, making China's rail system appear increasingly grand and complex, and the degree of hidden dangers is also becoming increasingly severe. To solve these problems, machine learning processing technology should be applied to urban subways, which is undoubtedly a very effective attempt. Therefore, we are committed to exploring machine learning based object recognition technology to better assist us in achieving public safety warning for urban rail transit. Therefore, this article constructs a comprehensive system framework to collect valuable information from monitoring images, thereby more accurately identifying and recording dangerous signals. Due to the development of modernization, the urban rail transit system has become increasingly complex. It is not only an infrastructure, but also provides support for business, society, energy, and information transmission. This article focuses on the important aspects of the safe operation of urban rail transit public safety networks based on machine learning algorithms. The system test results are relatively satisfactory, but we cannot accurately predict all possible risks, and due to the uncertainty of probability.

AB The paper proposes an alternative approach to improve the performance of image retrieval. In this work, a framework for image retrieval based on machine learning and semantic retrieval is proposed. In the preprocessing phase, the image is segmented objects by using Graph-cut, and the feature vectors of objects presented in the image and their visual relationships are extracted using R-CNN. The feature vectors, visual relationships, and their symbolic labels are stored in KD-Tree data structures which can be used to predict the label of objects and visual relationships later. To facilitate semantic query, the images use the RDF data model and create an ontology for the symbolic labels annotated. For each query image, after extracting their feature vectors, the KD-Tree is used to classify the objects and predict their relationship. After that, a SPARQL query is built to extract a set of similar images. The SPARQL query consists of triple statements describing the objects and their relationship which were previously predicted. The evaluation of the framework with the MS-COCO dataset and Flickr showed that the precision achieved scores of 0.9218 and 0.9370, respectively.

AB With the appearance of complete mammalian genomes, comparative approaches have experienced a recent upsurge. Searching maximal exact match is among the most used tasks in sequence searching within a larger DNA sequence or database. Many exact algorithms have been designed to deal with this problem. The best improvements made by these algorithms have led to a time and space complexity of O(n) and they remain practically less effective for large sequences. Heuristic methods will therefore be a good alternative to implement. In this work, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm based on PSO metaheuristic to deal with the problem of searching the maximal exact match of small searched sequences in large ones. The time and space complexity of the designed algorithm is of O(1). The experimental results showed the efficiency of the proposed search algorithm for finding maximal exact match in large sequences when compared with two other sequence searching algorithms.

TI Uncertainty-guided dual-views for semi-supervised volumetric medical
   image segmentation
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Deep learning has led to tremendous progress in the field of medical artificial intelligence. However, training deep-learning models usually require large amounts of annotated data. Annotating large-scale datasets is prone to human biases and is often very laborious, especially for dense prediction tasks such as image segmentation. Inspired by semi-supervised algorithms that use both labelled and unlabelled data for training, we propose a dual-view framework based on adversarial learning for segmenting volumetric images. In doing so, we use critic networks to allow each view to learn from high-confidence predictions of the other view by measuring a notion of uncertainty. Furthermore, to jointly learn the dual-views and the critics, we formulate the learning problem as a min-max problem. We analyse and contrast our proposed method against state-of-the-art baselines, both qualitatively and quantitatively, on four public datasets with multiple modalities (for example, computerized topography and magnetic resonance imaging) and demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised method substantially outperforms the competing baselines while achieving competitive performance compared to fully supervised counterparts. Our empirical results suggest that an uncertainty-guided co-training framework can make two neural networks robust to data artefacts and have the ability to generate plausible segmentation masks that can be helpful for semi-automated segmentation processes.
   It is challenging to obtain a sufficient amount of high-quality annotated images for deep-learning applications in medical imaging, and practical methods often use a combination of labelled and unlabelled data. A dual-view framework builds on such semi-supervised approaches and uses two independently trained critic networks that learn from each other to generate segmentation masks in different medical imaging modalities.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been widely used in skeleton-based action recognition. Though significant performance has been achieved, it is still challenging to effectively model the complex dynamics of skeleton sequences. A novel position-aware spatio-temporal GCN for skeleton-based action recognition is proposed, where the positional encoding is investigated to enhance the capacity of typical baselines for comprehending the dynamic characteristics of action sequence. Specifically, the authors' method systematically investigates the temporal position encoding and spatial position embedding, in favour of explicitly capturing the sequence ordering information and the identity information of nodes that are used in graphs. Additionally, to alleviate the redundancy and over-smoothing problems of typical GCNs, the authors' method further investigates a subgraph mask, which gears to mine the prominent subgraph patterns over the underlying graph, letting the model be robust against the impaction of some irrelevant joints. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve competitive results comparing to the previous state-of-art methods.

AB A stimulus can be encoded in a population of spiking neurons through any change in the statistics of the joint spike pattern, yet we commonly summarize single-trial population activity by the summed spike rate across cells: the population peristimulus time histogram (pPSTH). For neurons with a low baseline spike rate that encode a stimulus with a rate increase, this simplified representation works well, but for populations with high baseline rates and heterogeneous response patterns, the pPSTH can obscure the response. We introduce a different representation of the population spike pattern, which we call an "information train," that is well suited to conditions of sparse responses, especially those that involve decreases rather than increases in firing. We use this tool to study populations with varying levels of burstiness in their spiking statistics to determine how burstiness affects the representation of spike decreases (firing "gaps"). Our simulated populations of spiking neurons varied in size, baseline rate, burst statistics, and correlation. Using the information train decoder, we find that there is an optimal level of burstiness for gap detection that is robust to several other parameters of the population. We consider this theoretical result in the context of experimental data from different types of retinal ganglion cells and determine that the baseline spike statistics of a recently identified type support nearly optimal detection of both the onset and strength of a contrast step.

TI Graph-Regularized Tensor Regression: A Domain-Aware Framework for

SO NEURAL COMPUTATION

DT Article
ID DATA ANALYTICS; DECOMPOSITIONS
AB Modern data analytics applications are increasingly characterized by exceedingly large and multidimensional data sources. This represents a challenge for traditional machine learning models, as the number of model parameters needed to process such data grows exponentially with the data dimensions, an effect known as the curse of dimensionality. Recently, tensor decomposition (TD) techniques have shown promising results in reducing the computational costs associated with large-dimensional models while achieving comparable performance. However, such tensor models are often unable to incorporate the underlying domain knowledge when compressing high-dimensional models. To this end, we introduce a novel graph-regularized tensor regression (GRTR) framework, whereby domain knowledge about intramodal relations is incorporated into the model in the form of a graph Laplacian matrix. This is then used as a regularization tool to promote a physically meaningful structure within the model parameters. By virtue of tensor algebra, the proposed framework is shown to be fully interpretable, both coefficient-wise and dimension-wise. The GRTR model is validated in a multiway regression setting and compared against competing models and is shown to achieve improved performance at reduced computational costs. Detailed visualizations are provided to help readers gain an intuitive understanding of the employed tensor operations.

AB We examine the efficiency of information processing in a balanced excitatory and inhibitory (E-I) network during the developmental critical period, when network plasticity is heightened. A multimodule network composed of E-I neurons was defined, and its dynamics were examined by regulating the balance between their activities. When adjusting E-I activity, both transitive chaotic synchronization with a high Lyapunov dimension and conventional chaos with a low Lyapunov dimension were found. In between, the edge of high-dimensional chaos was observed. To quantify the efficiency of information processing, we applied a short-term memory task in reservoir computing to the dynamics of our network. We found that memory capacity was maximized when optimal E-I balance was realized, underscoring both its vital role and vulnerability during critical periods of brain development.

AB Dimension reduction is one of the key data transformation techniques in machine learning and knowledge discovery. It can be realized by using linear and nonlinear transformation techniques. An additive autoencoder for dimension reduction, which is composed of a serially performed bias estimation, linear trend estimation, and nonlinear residual estimation, is proposed and analyzed. Compared to the classical model, adding an explicit linear operator to the overall transformation and considering the nonlinear residual estimation in the original data dimension significantly improves the data reproduction capabilities of the proposed model. The computational experiments confirm that an autoencoder of this form, with only a shallow network to encapsulate the nonlinear behavior, is able to identify an intrinsic dimension of a dataset with low autoencoding error. This observation leads to an investigation in which shallow and deep network structures, and how they are trained, are compared. We conclude that the deeper network structures obtain lower autoencoding errors during the identification of the intrinsic dimension. However, the detected dimension does not change compared to a shallow network. As far as we know, this is the first experimental result concluding no benefit from a deep architecture compared to its shallow counterpart.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

DT Article
DE Event detection; Incremental learning; Knowledge distillation; Pseudo
   labels; Catastrophic forgetting
AB Event detection (ED) is of fundamental importance for many information extraction tasks. But conventional ED models require a fixed set of pre-defined event types. When an event trigger that cannot be categorized as any of these types occurs, they have to be re-trained from scratch with data from both old and new classes, so they are impractical in real life. In this paper, we propose a more realistic incremental event detection (IED) model that incrementally learns new event types at different times while not catastrophically forgetting the learned old classes. Although a knowledge distillation-based (KD-based) approach can be used to solve catastrophic forgetting, we find that conflicts arise when applying a general KD method to the IED task. Specifically, such conflicts mainly occur in two common scenarios: the first is that the triggers are labeled as a non-trigger word class in the current step, but at the same time, predicted as an old event type by the previous model (None-old class label confusion). The second is that the triggers are labeled as a new event type in the current step, but at the same time, predicted as a non-trigger word class by the previous model (None-new class label confusion). To solve the conflicts in each scenario, we generate pseudo labels and modify the distillation loss to improve the prediction accuracy on old and new classes, respectively. Comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming the state-of-the-art model.

DE Facial expression recognition; Cross-hierarchy contrast
ID DEEP; ATTENTION; FEATURES
AB Facial expression recognition (FER) tasks with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have seen remarkable progress. However, these CNN-based approaches do not well capture detailed and crucial features that can distinguish different facial expressions from a global perspective. There is still much room for improvement in the performance of existing CNN-based models for FER. To address this, we propose a novel cross-hierarchy contrast (CHC) framework called FER-CHC for FER tasks. FER-CHC employs a contrastive learning mechanism to utilize these crucial features in improving the performance of CNN-based models for FER. Specifically, FER-CHC utilizes CHC to regularize the feature learning of the backbone network and enhance global representations of facial expressions. The CHC captures common and differential features from different facial expressions with a cross-hierarchy contrast mechanism. Furthermore, a fusion network globally integrates the features learned from both the backbone network and CHC to learn a more robust feature representation. We conducted comprehensive experiments on six popular datasets: CK+, FER2013, FER+, RAF-DB, AffectNet, and JAFFE. The results show that our proposed FER-CHC achieves state-of-the-art performances on these datasets. Additionally, an ablation study was conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components in FER-CHC.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Video salient object detection targets at extracting the most conspicuous objects in a video sequence, which facilitate various video processing tasks, e.g., video compression, video recognition, etc. Although remarkable progress has been made for video salient object detection, most existing methods still suffer from coarse edge boundaries which may hinder their usage in real-world applications. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a Motion Context guided Edge-preserving network (MCE-Net) model for video salient object detection. MCE-Net can generate temporally consistent salient edges, which are then leveraged to refine the salient object regions completely and uniformly. The core innovation in MCE-Net is an Asymmetric Cross-Reference Module (ACRM), which is designed to exploit the cross-modal complementarity between spatial structure and motion flow, facilitating robust salient object edge extraction. To leverage the extracted edge features for salient object refinement, we fuse them with multi-level spatial-temporal embeddings in a paralleled guidance manner, generating the final saliency results. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and the edge annotations are generated automatically from ground truth saliency maps. Experimental evaluations on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve superior performance to other outstanding methods. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that our method can preserve salient objects with clear boundary structures in video sequences.

AB Formalizing surgical activities as triplets of the used instruments, actions performed, and target anatomies is becoming a gold standard approach for surgical activity modeling. The benefit is that this formalization helps to obtain a more detailed understanding of tool-tissue interaction which can be used to develop better Artificial Intelligence assistance for image-guided surgery. Earlier efforts and the CholecTriplet challenge introduced in 2021 have put together techniques aimed at recognizing these triplets from surgical footage. Estimating also the spatial locations of the triplets would offer a more precise intraoperative context-aware decision support for computer-assisted intervention. This paper presents the CholecTriplet2022 challenge, which extends surgical action triplet modeling from recognition to detection. It includes weakly-supervised bounding box localization of every visible surgical instrument (or tool), as the key actors, and the modeling of each tool-activity in the form of & LANGBRAC;instrument,verb, target & rang; triplet. The paper describes a baseline method and 10 new deep learning algorithms presented at the challenge to solve the task. It also provides thorough methodological comparisons of the methods, an in-depth analysis of the obtained results across multiple metrics, visual and procedural challenges; their significance, and useful insights for future research directions and applications in surgery.

AB In responding to freight transportation fire incidents, first responders refer to the terials labeled on the freights and the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) for guidance on the initial response. However, when the burning goods are mixed or unknown, first responders require support on the appropriate response strategy. In this work, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) enabled tool to aid first responders in the initial emergency response to fire incidents involving mixed or unknown materials. We used many different machine learning models, including MultiRocket, Omni-Scale CNN (OS-CNN), Ultra-Fast Shapelets (UFA), WEASEL+MUSE, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Time Series Forest (TSF), the Random Interval Spectral Ensemble (RISE), and InceptionTime, to develop a trained machine learning (ML) model integrated into the AI tool. The ML model identifies the hazard characteristics (e.g., toxicity and explosivity) of a given fire, based on chemicals found in the effluent. The effluent data was collected from samples of burning materials using a cone calorimeter and a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) gas analyzer. We discuss the methodologies behind developing the ML model and demonstrate its high classification accuracy with time series augmentations to enhance the training dataset. We also implemented Self-Supervised Learning, Domain-Agnostic Contrastive Learning (DACL), and Adversarial Perturbation-based Latent Construction (APLR) to further improve the model. The results show that MultiRocket outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and running time. Furthermore, we developed a user interface for our AI-enabled tool, which uses a data sample as input to provide not only predictions of the fire hazards but also actionable intelligence to the first responders for safe and effective fire suppression strategies. Our proposed toolkit benefiting from AI will pave the way to further research in accessible, easily-deployable AI-enabled tools in fire sciences and management. Environmental Implications We leverage machine learning to predict the hazard classification of materials that may not be considered hazardous by Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) used by Transport Canada, but may release toxic substances when burning. For example, polyvinyl chloride is not considered as hazardous by ERG, but toxic and corrosive hydrochloric gas is produced when burning. We aim to provide more decision support to first responders in freight transportation fires involving non-hazardous or unknown materials to identify the scope of the emergency from the early stage of the fire, which is critical to protect the environment from the effects of the fire.

AB The eye-tracking and electroencephalogram data, as physiological information, have been viewed as effective supplements to subjective reporting for guiding the product appearance design. In this context, how to combine heterogeneous information is a challenging question. This study proposes different methods to determine sub-jective and objective weights of criteria regarding the self-reporting, eye-tracking, and electroencephalogram data for the evaluation of product appearance design. We introduce the probabilistic linguistic term set with interval uncertainty (IUPLTS) to represent complex self-reporting data, and develop a method to aggregate IUPLTSs. An algorithm is proposed to fuse physiological data on the data layer and feature layer. To combine the obtained heterogeneous information, we define an objective weighting method that examines the differences in indicator data and the correlation between indicators, and then use a level difference maximization model to fuse subjective and objective weights. To ensure the stability of decision-making results for the problem involving a large number of indicators, we use the Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to the Compromise Solution (MARCOS) to rank alternatives. An example regarding the evaluation of automobile appearance design schemes is presented to show the validity and practicality of the proposed method. The prototype support system of the proposed method has been developed and is freely available at https://github.com/BitSecret/DAQQSO.

ID CONSENSUS
AB This article investigates the problem of communication-efficient and resilient multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). Specifically, we consider a setting where a set of agents are interconnected over a given network, and can only exchange information with their neighbors. Each agent observes a common Markov Decision Process and has a local cost which is a function of the current system state and the applied control action. The goal of MARL is for all agents to learn a policy that optimizes the infinite horizon discounted average of all their costs. Within this general setting, we consider two extensions to existing MARL algorithms. First, we provide an event-triggered learning rule where agents only exchange information with their neighbors if a certain triggering condition is satisfied. We show that this enables learning while reducing the amount of communication. Next, we consider the scenario where some of the agents can be adversarial (as captured by the Byzantine attack model), and arbitrarily deviate from the prescribed learning algorithm. We establish a fundamental trade-off between optimality and resilience when Byzantine agents are present. We then create a resilient algorithm and show almost sure convergence of all reliable agents' value functions to the neighborhood of the optimal value function of all reliable agents, under certain conditions on the network topology. When the optimal Q-values are sufficiently separated for different actions, we show that all reliable agents can learn the optimal policy under our algorithm.

   function; quantum computing; quantum neuron framework
AB Quantum computing has been revolutionizing the development of algorithms. However, only noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are available currently, which imposes several restrictions on the circuit implementation of quantum algorithms. In this article, we propose a framework that builds quantum neurons based on kernel machines, where the quantum neurons differ from each other by their feature space mappings. Besides contemplating previous quantum neurons, our generalized framework has the capacity to instantiate other feature mappings that allow us to solve real problems better. Under that framework, we present a neuron that applies a tensor-product feature mapping to an exponentially larger space. The proposed neuron is implemented by a circuit of constant depth with a linear number of elementary single-qubit gates. The previous quantum neuron applies a phase-based feature mapping with an exponentially expensive circuit implementation, even using multiqubit gates. Additionally, the proposed neuron has parameters that can change its activation function shape. Here, we show the activation function shape of each quantum neuron. It turns out that parametrization allows the proposed neuron to optimally fit underlying patterns that the existing neuron cannot fit, as demonstrated in the nonlinear toy classification problems addressed here. The feasibility of those quantum neuron solutions is also contemplated in the demonstration through executions on a quantum simulator. Finally, we compare those kernel-based quantum neurons in the problem of handwritten digit recognition, where the performances of quantum neurons that implement classical activation functions are also contrasted here. The repeated evidence of the parametrization potential achieved in real-life problems allows concluding that this work provides a quantum neuron with improved discriminative abilities. As a consequence, the generalized framework of quantum neurons can contribute toward practical quantum advantage.

AB Remote sensing image technology to the ground has important guiding significance in disaster assessment and emergency rescue deployment. In order to realize the fast automatic registration of multi-sensor remote sensing images, the remote sensing image block registration idea is introduced, and the image reconstruction is processed by using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD) method. The scale-invariant feature transformation (SIFT) algorithm is improved and optimized by combining the function-fitting method. By this way, it can improve the registration accuracy and efficiency of multi-sensor remote sensing images. The results show that the average peak signal-to-noise ratio of the image processed by the CGD method is 25.428. The average root mean square value is 17.442. The average image processing time is 6.093 s. These indicators are better than the passive filter algorithm and the gradient descent method. The average accuracy of image registration of the improved SIFT registration method is 96.37%, and the average image registration time is 2.14 s. These indicators are significantly better than the traditional SIFT algorithm and speeded-up robust features algorithm. It is proved that the improved SIFT registration method can effectively improve the accuracy and operation efficiency of multi-sensor remote sensing image registration methods. The improved SIFT registration method effectively solves the problems of low accuracy and long time consumption of traditional multi-sensor remote sensing image fast registration methods. While maintaining high registration accuracy, it improves the image registration speed and provides technical support for a rapid disaster assessment after major disasters such as earthquakes and floods. And it has an important value for the development of the efficient post-disaster rescue deployment.

AB Musculoskeletal Disorders associated with the elbow are one of the most common forms of work-related injuries. Exoskeletons have been proposed as an approach to reduce and ideally eliminate these injuries; however, exoskeletons introduce their own problems, especially discomfort due to joint misalignment. The Elbow-sideWINDER with its associated control strategy is a novel elbow exoskeleton to assist elbow flexion/extension during occupational tasks. This study describes the exoskeleton showing how this can minimize discomfort caused by joint misalignment, maximize assistive performance, and provide increased robustness and reliability in real worksites. The proposed medium-level control strategy can provide effective assistive torque using three control units as follows: an arm kinematics estimator, a load estimator, and a friction compensator. The combined hardware/software system of the Elbow-sideWINDER is tested in load-lifting tasks (2 and 7 kg). This experiment focuses on the reduction in the activation level of the biceps brachii and triceps brachii in both arms and the change in the range of motion of the elbow during the task. It is shown that using the Elbow-sideWINDER, the biceps brachii, responsible for the elbow flexion, was significantly less activated (up to 38.8% at 2 kg and 25.7% at 7 kg, on average for both arms). For the triceps brachii, the muscle activation was reduced by up to 37.0% at 2 kg and 35.1% at 7 kg, on average for both arms. When wearing the exoskeleton, the range of motion of the elbow was reduced by up to 13.0 & DEG; during the task, but it was within a safe range and could be compensated for by other joints such as the waist or knees. There are extremely encouraging results that provide good indicators and important clues for future improvement of the Elbow-sideWINDER and its control strategy.

DE Feature fusion; multimodal learning; predictive coding (PC);
   self-supervised learning; sound source separation
ID INTEGRATION
AB The framework of visually guided sound source separation generally consists of three parts: visual feature extraction, multimodal feature fusion, and sound signal processing. An ongoing trend in this field has been to tailor involved visual feature extractor for informative visual guidance and separately devise module for feature fusion, while utilizing U-Net by default for sound analysis. However, such a divide-and-conquer paradigm is parameter-inefficient and, meanwhile, may obtain suboptimal performance as jointly optimizing and harmonizing various model components is challengeable. By contrast, this article presents a novel approach, dubbed audio-visual predictive coding (AVPC), to tackle this task in a parameter-efficient and more effective manner. The network of AVPC features a simple ResNet-based video analysis network for deriving semantic visual features, and a predictive coding (PC)-based sound separation network that can extract audio features, fuse multimodal information, and predict sound separation masks in the same architecture. By iteratively minimizing the prediction error between features, AVPC integrates audio and visual information recursively, leading to progressively improved performance. In addition, we develop a valid self-supervised learning strategy for AVPC via copredicting two audio-visual representations of the same sound source. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AVPC outperforms several baselines in separating musical instrument sounds, while reducing the model size significantly. Code is available at: https://github.com/zjsong/Audio-Visual-Predictive-Coding.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Camouflaged object segmentation (COS); deep learning; polyp
   segmentation; salient object detection
AB In the biosphere, camouflaged objects take the advantage of visional wholeness by keeping the color and texture of the objects highly consistent with the background, thereby confusing the visual mechanism of other creatures and achieving a concealed effect. This is also the main reason why the task of camouflaged object detection is challenging. In this article, we break the visual wholeness and see through the camouflage from the perspective of matching the appropriate field of view. We propose a matching-recognition-refinement network (MRR-Net), which consists of two key modules, i.e., the visual field matching and recognition module (VFMRM) and the stepwise refinement module (SWRM). In the VFMRM, various feature receptive fields are used to match candidate areas of camouflaged objects of different sizes and shapes and adaptively activate and recognize the approximate area of the real camouflaged object. The SWRM then uses the features extracted by the backbone to gradually refine the camouflaged region obtained by VFMRM, thus yielding the complete camouflaged object. In addition, a more efficient deep supervision method is exploited, making the features from the backbone input into the SWRM more critical and not redundant. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MRR-Net runs in real-time (82.6 frames/s) and significantly outperforms 30 state-of-the-art models on three challenging datasets under three standard metrics. Furthermore, MRR-Net is applied to four downstream tasks of camouflaged object segmentation (COS), and the results validate its practical application value. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/MRR-Net.

AB Building upon the foundational principles of the grid search algorithm and Monte Carlo numerical simulation, this article introduces an innovative epidemic monitoring and prevention plan. The plan offers the capability to accurately identify the sources of infectious diseases and predict the final scale and duration of the epidemic. The proposed plan is implemented in schools and society, utilizing computer simulation analysis. Through this analysis, the plan enables precise localization of infection sources for various demographic groups, with an error rate of less than 3%. Additionally, the plan allows for the estimation of the epidemic cycle duration, which typically spans around 14 days. Notably, higher population density enhances fault tolerance and prediction accuracy, resulting in smaller errors and more reliable simulation outcomes. Overall, this study provides highly valuable theoretical guidance for effective epidemic prevention and control efforts.

AB Personalized recommendation is a technical means to help users quickly and efficiently obtain interesting content from massive information. However, the traditional recommendation algorithm is difficult to solve the problem of sparse data and cold start and does not make reasonable use of the user-item rating matrix. In this article, a personalized recommendation method based on deep belief network (DBN) and softmax regression is proposed to address the issues with traditional recommendation algorithms. In this method, the DBN is used to learn the deep representation of users and items, and the user-item rating matrix is maximized. Then softmax regression is used to learn multiple categories in the feature space to predict the probability of interaction between users and items. Finally, the method is applied to the area of movie recommendation. The key to this method is the negative sampling mechanism, which greatly improves the effectiveness of the recommendations, as a result, creates an accurate list of recommendations. This method was verified and evaluated on Douban and several movielens datasets of different sizes. The experimental results demonstrate that the recommended performance of this model, which has high accuracy and generalization ability, is much better than typical baseline models such as singular value decomposition (SVD), and the mean absolute error (MAE) value is 98%, which is lower than the best baseline model.

AB The great advance and affordability of technologies, communications and sensor technology has led to the generation of large amounts of data in the field of the Internet of Things and smart environments, as well as a great demand for smart applications and services adapted to the specific needs of each individual. This has entailed the need for systems capable of receiving, routing and processing large amounts of data to detect situations of interest with low latency, but despite the many existing works in recent years, studying highly scalable and low latency data processing systems is still necessary. In this area, the efficiency of complex event processing (CEP) technology is of particular significance and has been used in a variety of application scenarios. However, in most of these scenarios there is no performance evaluation to show how the system performs under various loads and therefore the developer is challenged to develop such CEP-based systems in new scenarios without knowing how the system will be able to handle different input data rates and address scalability and fault tolerance. This article aims to fill this gap by providing an evaluation of the various versions of one of the most reputable CEP engines-Esper CEP, as well as its integration with two renowned messaging brokers for data ingestion-RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka. For this purpose, we defined a benchmark with a series of event patterns with some of the most representative operators of the Esper CEP engine and we performed a series of tests with an increasing rate of input data to the system. We did this for three alternative software architectures: integrating open-source Esper and RabbitMQ, integrating one instance of Esper enterprise edition with Apache Kafka, and integrating two distributed instances of Esper enterprise edition with Apache Kafka. We measured the usage of CPU, RAM memory, latency and throughput time, looking for the data input rate with which the system overloads for each event pattern and we compared the results of the three proposed architectures. The results have shown a very low CPU consumption for all implementation options and input data rates; a balanced memory usage, quite similar among the three architectures, up to an input rate of 10,000 or 15,000 events per second, depending on the architecture and event pattern, and a quite efficient response time up to 10,000 or 15,000 events per second, depending on the architecture and event pattern. Based on a more exhaustive analysis of results, we have concluded that the different options offered by Esper for CEP provide very efficient solutions for real-time data processing, although each with its limitations in terms of brokers to be used for data integration, scalability, and fault tolerance; a number of suggestions have been drawn out for the developer to take as a basis for choosing which CEP engine and which messaging broker to use for the implementation depending on the of the system in question.

AB The segmentation of quasi-periodic time series (QTS) is crucial for modeling analysis in industrial and medical fields. However, it is challenging to automatically and effectively split different types of QTSs under the same settings. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced graph-based QTS automatic segmentation (EGQAS) framework that integrates an enhanced graph structure and hybrid clustering. The enhanced graph structure improves the stability of QTS segmentation, especially for a large number of QTS, by using edge weight filtering and aggregation. Hybrid clustering, which consists of hierarchical clustering and a modified k-means algorithm, removes clusters with outliers and incomplete divisions to improve the integrity of the final QTS split points. For four different types of public datasets, EGQAS outperforms the current state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its better adaptability. In tests with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB), EGQAS proves itself to be effective and stable with a large number of data.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB As a class of randomized learning algorithms, stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in various intelligent scenarios. Regarding these algorithms, a growing interest in recent years has been shown in sparse representation, which is a powerful tool in many large-scale applications with high-dimensional data. However, few methods currently exist to fit sparse models in distributed environments. In this paper, we focus on devising two fully distributed learning algorithms for SCNs with sparsity regularization. The first algorithm is based on sample-wise division which is appropriate for the problem of large samples. The second algorithm is fit for high-dimensional data, which is based on feature-wise division. The sparse solutions for the decentralized optimization problems are obtained by introducing the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the distributed average consensus (DAC) algorithm. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB This paper mainly provides a group decision-making (GDM) method based on linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy preference relations (LIVIFPRs), where consistency and consensus analysis is conducted. The multiplicative consistency of LIVIFPRs is first introduced, and a consistency-based model is built to ascertain the missing values of an incomplete LIVIFPR. Considering the smallest distance, an optimization model is established to repair the unacceptably multiplicatively consistent LIVIFPR to have acceptable consistency. Meanwhile, the linguistic interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy priority weights of LIVIFPR are constructed via the optimal solutions of a programming model. Then, Algorithm I for decision-making with one incomplete LIVIFPR is presented. For the GDM problem, the weights of experts are determined before aggregating the individual LIVIFPRs. Moreover, when the consensus of an individual LIVIFPR is unacceptable, a mathematical model is utilized to reach the consensus requirement. Subsequently, Algorithm II for GDM with incomplete LIVIFPRs is proposed step-by-step. Finally, the new GDM method is used to evaluate four Chinese express companies, and the advantages of this approach are demonstrated by performing a comparison analysis.

   An oriented derivative of stick filter
AB Automatic segmentation of curvilinear objects in medical images plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of human diseases, yet it is a challenging uncertainty in the complex segmentation tasks due to different issues such as various image appearances, low contrast between curvilinear objects and their surrounding backgrounds, thin and uneven curvilinear structures, and improper background illumination conditions. To overcome these challenges, we present a unique curvilinear structure segmentation framework based on an oriented derivative of stick (ODoS) filter and a deep learning network for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images. Currently, a large number of deep learning models emphasize developing deep architectures and ignore capturing the structural features of curvilinear objects, which may lead to unsatisfactory results.In consequence, a new approach that incorporates an ODoS filter as part of a deep learning network is presented to improve the spatial attention of curvilinear objects.Specifically, the input image is transferred into four-channel image constructed by the ODoS filter. In which, the original image is considered the principal part to describe various image appearance and complex background illumination conditions, a multi-step strategy is used to enhance the contrast between curvilinear objects and their surrounding backgrounds, and a vector field is applied to discriminate thin and uneven curvilinear structures. Subsequently, a deep learning framework is employed to extract various structural features for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images.Which can effectively capture the spatial attention of curvature objects. The performance of the computational model is validated in experiments conducted on the publicly available DRIVE, STARE and CHASEDB1 datasets. Compared with ground truths, the presented model acquired high F1 values of 0.826, 0.819 and 0.808, and high accuracy of 0.969, 0.973, and 0.973 on three different datasets, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the presented model yields surprising results compared with those of some state-of-the-art methods.

AB In the absence of sufficient labels, deep neural networks (DNNs) are prone to overfitting, resulting in poor performance and difficulty in training. Thus, many semisupervised methods aim to use unlabeled sample information to compensate for the lack of label quantity. However, as the available pseudolabels increase, the fixed structure of traditional models has difficulty in matching them, limiting their effectiveness. Therefore, a deep-growing neural network with manifold constraints (DGNN-MC) is proposed. It can deepen the corresponding network structure with the expansion of a high-quality pseudolabel pool and preserve the local structure between the original and high-dimensional data in semisupervised learning. First, the framework filters the output of the shallow network to obtain pseudolabeled samples with high confidence and adds them to the original training set to form a new pseudolabeled training set. Second, according to the size of the new training set, it increases the depth of the layers to obtain a deeper network and conducts the training. Finally, it obtains new pseudolabeled samples and deepens the layers again until the network growth is completed. The growing model proposed in this article can be applied to other multilayer networks, as their depth can be transformed. Taking HSI classification as an example, a natural semisupervised problem, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method, which can mine more reliable information for better utilization and fully balance the growing amount of labeled data and network learning ability.

AB Multiview learning (MVL) concentrates on the problem where each instance is represented by multiple different feature sets. Efficiently exploring and exploiting the common and complementary information among different views remains challenging in MVL. Nevertheless, many existing algorithms deal with multiview problems via pairwise strategies, which limit the exploration of relationships among different views and dramatically increase the computational cost. In this article, we propose a multiview structural large margin classifier (MvSLMC) that simultaneously satisfies the consensus and complementarity principles in all views. Specifically, on the one hand, MvSLMC employs a structural regularization term to promote cohesion within-class and separability between-class in each view. On the other hand, different views provide extra structural information to each other, which favors the diversity of the classifier. Moreover, the introduction of hinge loss in MvSLMC results in sample sparsity, which we leverage to construct a safe screening rule (SSR) for accelerating MvSLMC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at safe screening in MVL. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MvSLMC and its safe acceleration method.

TI Chinese Idiom Paraphrasing
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Idioms are a kind of idiomatic expression in Chinese, most of which consist of four Chinese characters. Due to the properties of non-compositionality and metaphorical meaning, Chinese idioms are hard to be understood by children and non-native speakers. This study proposes a novel task, denoted as Chinese Idiom Paraphrasing (CIP). CIP aims to rephrase idiom-containing sentences to non-idiomatic ones under the premise of preserving the original sentence's meaning. Since the sentences without idioms are more easily handled by Chinese NLP systems, CIP can be used to pre-process Chinese datasets, thereby facilitating and improving the performance of Chinese NLP tasks, e.g., machine translation systems, Chinese idiom cloze, and Chinese idiom embeddings. In this study, we can treat the CIP task as a special paraphrase generation task. To circumvent difficulties in acquiring annotations, we first establish a large-scale CIP dataset based on human and machine collaboration, which consists of 115,529 sentence pairs. In addition to three sequence-to-sequence methods as the baselines, we further propose a novel infill-based approach based on text infilling. The results show that the proposed method has better performance than the baselines based on the established CIP dataset.

ID WORD RECOGNITION; PHONOLOGICAL FREQUENCY
AB Neural network models have been proposed to explain the grapheme-phoneme mapping process in humans for many alphabet languages. These models not only successfully learned the correspondence of the letter strings and their pronunciation, but also captured human behavior in nonce word naming tasks. How would the neural models perform for a non-alphabet language (e.g., Chinese) unknown character task? How well would the model capture human behavior? In this study, we first collect human speakers' answers on unknown Character naming tasks and then evaluate a set of transformer models by comparing their performance with human behaviors on an unknown Chinese character naming task. We found that the models and humans behaved very similarly, that they had similar accuracy distribution for each character, and had a substantial overlap in answers. In addition, the models' answers are highly correlated with humans' answers. These results suggested that the transformer models can capture humans' character naming behavior well.(1)

TI Rank-Aware Negative Training for Semi-Supervised Text Classification
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Semi-supervised text classification-based paradigms (SSTC) typically employ the spirit of self-training. The key idea is to train a deep classifier on limited labeled texts and then iteratively predict the unlabeled texts as their pseudo-labels for further training. However, the performance is largely affected by the accuracy of pseudo-labels, which may not be significant in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a Rank-aware Negative Training (RNT) framework to address SSTC in learning with noisy label settings. To alleviate the noisy information, we adapt a reasoning with uncertainty-based approach to rank the unlabeled texts based on the evidential support received from the labeled texts. Moreover, we propose the use of negative training to train RNT based on the concept that "the input instance does not belong to the complementary label". A complementary label is randomly selected from all labels except the label on-target. Intuitively, the probability of a true label serving as a complementary label is low and thus provides less noisy information during the training, resulting in better performance on the test data. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution on various text classification benchmark datasets. Our extensive experiments show that it consistently overcomes the state-of-the-art alternatives in most scenarios and achieves competitive performance in the others. The code of RNT is publicly available on GitHub.

TI MACSum: Controllable Summarization with Mixed Attributes
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Controllable summarization allows users to generate customized summaries with specified attributes. However, due to the lack of designated annotations of controlled summaries, existing work has to craft pseudo datasets by adapting generic summarization benchmarks. Furthermore, most research focuses on controlling single attributes individually (e.g., a short summary or a highly abstractive summary) rather than controlling a mix of attributes together (e.g., a short and highly abstractive summary). In this paper, we propose MAC SUM, the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. It contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (Length, Extractiveness, Specificity, Topic, and Speaker). We propose two simple and effective parameter-efficient approaches for the new task of mixed controllable summarization based on hard prompt tuning and soft prefix tuning. Results and analysis demonstrate that hard prompt models yield the best performance on most metrics and human evaluations. However, mixed-attribute control is still challenging for summarization tasks. Our dataset and code are available at https:// github.com/psunlpgroup/MACSum.

TI MENLI: Robust Evaluation Metrics from Natural Language Inference
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS

DT Article
ID QUALITY
AB Recently proposed BERT-based evaluation metrics for text generation perform well on standard benchmarks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, e.g., relating to information correctness. We argue that this stems (in part) from the fact that they are models of semantic similarity. In contrast, we develop evaluation metrics based on Natural Language Inference (NLI), which we deem a more appropriate modeling. We design a preference-based adversarial attack framework and show that our NLI based metrics are much more robust to the attacks than the recent BERT-based metrics. On standard benchmarks, our NLI based metrics outperform existing summarization metrics, but perform below SOTA MT metrics. However, when combining existing metrics with our NLI metrics, we obtain both higher adversarial robustness (15%-30%) and higher quality metrics as measured on standard benchmarks (+5% to 30%).

AB Getting the most out of limited resources allows advances in natural language processing (NLP) research and practice while being conservative with resources. Those resources may be data, time, storage, or energy. Recent work in NLP has yielded interesting results from scaling; however, using only scale to improve results means that resource consumption also scales. That relationship motivates research into efficient methods that require less resources to achieve similar results. This survey relates and synthesises methods and findings in those efficiencies in NLP, aiming to guide new researchers in the field and inspire the development of new methods.

DE Image classification; long-tailed; noisy labels
ID DEEP
AB Most existing methods that cope with noisy labels usually assume that the classwise data distributions are well balanced. They are difficult to deal with the practical scenarios where training samples have imbalanced distributions, since they are not able to differentiate noisy samples from tail classes' clean samples. This article makes an early effort to tackle the image classification task in which the provided labels are noisy and have a long-tailed distribution. To deal with this problem, we propose a new learning paradigm which can screen out noisy samples by matching between inferences on weak and strong data augmentations. A leave-noise-out regularization (LNOR) is further introduced to eliminate the effect of the recognized noisy samples. Besides, we propose a prediction penalty based on the online classwise confidence levels to avoid the bias toward easy classes which are dominated by head classes. Extensive experiments on five datasets including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, FashionMNIST, and Clothing1M demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing algorithms for learning with long-tailed distribution and label noise.

AB Information systems (IS) and data analytics-focused academic disciplines remained surprisingly silent in attempting to contribute to a public understanding of critical societal challenges such as foreclosures. This paper tackles the gap by presenting a framework for building foreclosure prediction models by integrating publicly-available census-tract demographic data and readily-available technology (geographic IS (GIS) and machine learning (ML)). The framework is tested and validated using over 19,000 foreclosures from Cuyahoga County (OH) using J48 decision tree, artificial neural network, and Naive Bayes algorithms. The framework's empirical test identifies nine critical demographic attributes to successfully predict foreclosures, confirming the findings of prior studies while offering several new, highly predictive variables that were missed by prior research. This research is a call to broader IS, CS, and data science communities to assist society in understanding critical societal issues that may need deploying and integrating more advanced technologies.

AB The strategy production in intuitionistic fuzzy multi-attribute decision-making is influenced by various factors. More realistic data representations are needed to portray ambiguity under increasingly complex decision-making contexts. Firstly, this study proposes a new approach for ranking independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on the risk attitudes of decision-makers. The proposed ranking approach incorporates the decision-makers' risk preferences and considers all possible values in the feasible domain. After that, a novel similarity measure between two independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is presented based on the three-segment projection. The constructed similarity measure uses the image structure of the data to reflect the variation of vagueness and then also combines deviation to achieve optimization. Moreover, this study improves the VIKOR method under the independent trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy environment (V-ITIFE) to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problems. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the V-ITIFE method.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB At present, distributed research on the inference process of neural networks mainly spreads the different stages of neural network functions to multiple devices. Many devices do not perform calculations simultaneously, and due to their dependence on multiple devices, their error rate is low and resource utilization is also low. On this issue, this article proposes a design scheme for distributed neural networks. Modern warfare requires increasingly high tactical requirements for high speed, high precision, and long-range strike capabilities. On the other hand, the diversity and complexity of missile missions may lead missiles to move toward informatization and intelligence. The relevant guidance and control systems will face many challenges. The environment in which missiles fly has undergone significant changes with the expansion of their range, and attack missions have evolved from unidirectional to complementary directions. Controlling self-adjusting flight and internet orbit planning have become the primary requirements for the next generation of information missiles. Therefore, this research is aimed at determining distributed neural network algorithms for coastal atmospheric characteristics, as well as protection plans for missile trajectory attacks.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the most promising solutions in modern technology for increased reliability, remote monitoring, tracking of objects, etc., that are directly tied to sensor nodes. During transmission, if these data be stolen or manipulated, patients' privacy would be violated, and their life may be compromised. Several researchers have worked on encrypted personal health records (PHRs). Depending upon the leakage of training and deep learning models, certain clients, however, do not want their data to be exchanged with the analytics company, but there are still a few difficulties, such as data leakage during deep learning and training model leaks. A critical topic is how to secure privacy while using deep learning. Initially, the wireless sensors collect the patient's health data, which are encrypted through homomorphic encryption. Further, this study proposed a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based Henry gas solubility (HGS) optimization for disease (COVID-19) prediction. The DCNN-HGS algorithm is used to assess and check the health data of patients to forecast disease and issue timely alerts. To ensure the privacy of health information, we deploy an assured data deletion method, wherein the data holder could choose to deny access to particular users' health data. Comprehensive study and empirical studies are offered to demonstrate the security and efficiency of our proposed strategy.

AB The current trend is artificial intelligence-based automated vehicle driving, which has been mixed with a few physical problems such as real-time traffic sensing and communication between vehicles, as well as vehicle to infrastructure latency. Previously, RADAR and other short-distance communication-based approaches were built to solve the issue. Even image processing approaches were used for minimizing the vehicle detection and object detection models with various classification models. But these problems were raised in terms of communication and delay in communication. This made short-distance communication integrated with mm WAVE technology along with line of sight, for direction and lane detection possible, and V-V and V-I communication more stable. Here, in this paper, V-V and V-I communication was implemented. V-X (combining V-V and V-I simultaneously) modules implementation results in vehicles' connectivity, and their communication was established using the 802.11p module-based dedicated short-range communication for effective and efficient communication (with a roadside infrastructure as well as computing the position concerning capabilities); previously, it was implemented by 802.11e module. This approach also helps the driver of the vehicle to learn the streamlined traffic and roadways. The proposed V-X communication system was minimized to travel very safely and reduce delayed communication, which is an important barrier to the communication system.

AB Osteosarcoma has been the widely occurred primary malignant tumors of bone in children and adolescents. Emerging reports have revealed that it is one refractory medical oncological disease. Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) were reported to function importantly in many tumors and are probably regarded as a predictor for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Here, we attempted to explore the function mechanism of KIF15 in osteosarcoma. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database analysis results revealed that KIF was differentially expressed in cancer tissues and adjacent normal ones. There was a significant association existing in highly expressed KIF4A, CENPE (KIF10), KIF15, KIF18A and KIF20A and poor prognosis. KEGG analysis data revealed that KIF majorly participated in DNA replication and cell cycle. Based on above-mentioned analysis data and documents information in the databases, we conducted quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), CCK-8 and Transwell assays to detect KIF15 expression in osteosarcoma tissues and corresponding adjacent normal tissues. Our data demonstrated that osteosarcoma tissues highly expressed KIF15 compared to normal tissues. What was more, overexpressing KIF15 markedly strengthens cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma in vitro. Our data collectively suggest that KIF15 is a probable oncogene and newly generated treatment target in osteosarcoma.

AB In this study, the enrolled patients were treated with active glucose control, blood pressure control or improvement of anemia. And instruct patients to adhere to low-salt and low-fat diet, ingest part of a low-protein diet, and reduce the effect of glomerular hyperfiltration as much as possible. When the disease enters the third stage, the doctor usually recommends a protein intake of 0.6 g/(kg d) to slow down the progression of the disease as much as possible. From the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine, according to the existing theory, CKD is more common, and its treatment principle is mainly to strengthen the spleen and kidneys, eliminate pathogenic bacteria, and activate meridians. The results of this study showed that serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in the traditional Chinese medicine group were lower than those in the conventional group. The overall effective rate of the TCM group was 73.33%, which was much higher than that of the conventional group. Traditional Chinese medicine to strengthen renal function and digging method has good efficacy in patients with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease and has high application value in promoting the recovery of biochemical indexes, alleviating clinical symptoms and adverse drug reactions.

AB Healthcare researchers have recently concentrated their efforts on new medication development methodologies that draw on existing pharmacological data. Even while drug-gene interactions are uncommon, a major danger is that medications will have an unexpected/unintended interaction with off-target proteins, resulting in side effects. There are a number of strategies for predicting drug interactions, but many of them require inputs like drug targets, which are hard to come by. In order to better understand drug interactions and to perform drug recommendations based on the analysis, particularly DDIs, several computational tools have been created. In addition to the possibility of DDI occurrence, these methods do not provide enough specifics, and they typically necessitate comprehensive pharmacological information that is not readily available for DDI prediction. Several academic areas have exceptional progress with deep learning during the last decade. Deep learning has emerged as a viable and successful technique for working with biological and chemical data due to its ability to learn at higher levels of abstraction. Deep learning techniques have been used to increase the accuracy of predicting DDI, and the results are encouraging. In the proposed model, an Interactive Drug Recommendation Model using Deep Learning Approach with Drug Data Analysis (IDR-DLA-DDA), several drugs are analysed and then drug recommendation is performed to the end users based on the analysis. The proposed model suggests suitable drugs to the end users. The proposed model is contrasted with the existing models, and the results represent that the proposed model is efficient in recommending a suitable drug.

AB This paper studies the emotion recognition effect of different characteristic parameters by extracting the characteristic parameters of EEG data in the frontal lobe area. The ultimate purpose of wavelet transform is to obtain data of emotional signals at different frequencies, that is, to perform scaling and translation operations at different scales according to the wavelet function. The EEG signals expressed by different emotional states in different locations of the cerebral cortex are also different. Different, especially the frontal lobe area will have a certain degree of influence on emotion. Therefore, the ability to extract the features of EEG signals is closely related to the deep research of emotion recognition. The purpose of adopting a positive intervention program is to reduce negative emotions through the increase of positive emotions. From the experimental data, it can be concluded that the participants in the experimental group can establish a relatively safe group atmosphere with the help of the instructor, and gradually build a sense of group trust.

AB Inflammations that result in severe pharyngitis are frequently brought on by streptococcal pharyngitis. A low average survival rate for oral cancer distinguishes it as an aggressive illness. Tonsillitis is a disease of viral nature that can lead to severe obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease and kidney disease. The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has rekindled interest in using telemedicine to treat patients with pharyngitis, oral cancer and tonsillitis. Deep learning technology has advanced quickly, making it possible to complete categorization training tasks more quickly. The technique of Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) had shown remarkable improvement in accuracy of classification of images. On the other hand, the training of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on problem specific dataset blended with transfer learning from popular models like Inception-v3, MobileNet-v2 is taking hours of time. So, in this paper, first we have proposed a improved bag of visual words and results were presented. Secondly, we have applied feature fusion-based approach which mixes the features computed from improved bag of visual words and features taken from Convolutional Neural Network where training took place on four classes (Pharyngitis, Oral Cancer, Tonsillitis, and Healthy) of images with transfer learning for relatively low number of epochs. These features from both CNN and bag of visual words are given to ML models like Light Gradient Boosting Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting. The experimental results showed significant improvement in accuracy, precision and recall of machine learning model in proposed two cases.

AB In the current training, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is utilized, which tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to the challenge of predicting for finance applications. Several researches have shown that ANN-based strategies are trustworthy ways to estimate LSM. Most ANN training methods, however, struggle with serious issues including poor learning rates and getting stuck in indigenous smallest amount. Optimization algorithms (OA) like PSO container increase ANN presentation. PSO prototypical applications to ANN exercise not engaged in success planning to determine network design or relevant elements. Thus, the current work concentrated scheduled the request of a mixture ANN prototypical to the forecast based on fuzzy. For the ANN and PSO-ANN network models, a huge amount of statistics (a record with 168,970 preparation records and 42,243 challenging records) was collected after the Finance application. This data were used to make exercise and challenging datasets. All of the PSO algorithm variables (including the system limitation and system loads) remained tuned to provide maximized ROI. The projected outcomes (e.g., from ANN, PSO-ANN) aimed at together records (e.g., training and testing) of the models were calculated by one numerical catalogs, namely, Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE). As a consequence, together replicas displayed worthy presentation; nevertheless, the hybrid ANN model might outperform ANN in terms of performance, as determined by the ranking mechanism that was created. For the ANN and hybrid ANN replicas, it container be derived that the PSO-ANN prototypical demonstrated more dependability in predicting compared to the ANN.

ID DATA INJECTION ATTACKS
AB Enterprise data security is a critical concern for businesses, especially when it comes to storing sensitive information related to property and resource risk management. Integrating blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technology can provide a more secure and efficient solution for storing this type of data. Some multinational enterprises struggle with poor property and resource management, which leads to the loss of materials inventory information during storage. This lack of information prevents managers from accessing timely and accurate financial information, increasing the risk of foreign investment and resulting in financial crises. To address this problem, this paper proposes a secure storage system for Material Inventory Data (MID) that integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence technology. The proposed system consists of three components: transactions, blocks, and chains, which create a hierarchical structural model. The system's constraint function calculates the probability of multiple intruders attacking the system, and the target constraint conditions are divided to establish a safe storage mechanism. Additionally, the system uses an incentive mechanism where multiple nodes agree on the block contents to optimize the model and maximize block income. Simulation results show that the proposed system has a shorter data storage delay time than the conventional approach, and very little data loss, effectively ensuring the integrity of enterprise data security storage.

AB In recent times, online users freely express their sentiments in different life aspects because of the huge increase in social networks. Sentiment Analysis (SA) is one of the main Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields thanks to its important role in identifying sentiment polarities and making decisions from the public's opinions. The Arabic language is one of the most challenging languages for SA due to its various dialects, and morphological and syntactic complexities. Deep Learning (DL) models have shown significant capabilities, especially in SA. In particular, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have proven perfect abilities to learn sequential data. This paper proposes a comparative study result of Word2Vec and FastText word embedding models that are used to create two Arabic SA (ASA) LSTM-based approaches. The experimental results confirm that the LSTM model with FastText can significantly ameliorate the Arabic classification accuracy.

However, most evolving registration methods cannot tackle the local optimum well and they have rarely investigated the success ratio, which implies the probability of not falling into local optima and is closely related to the practicality of the algorithm. Evolutionary multi-task optimization (EMTO) is a widely used paradigm, which can boost exploration capability through knowledge transfer among related tasks. Inspired by this concept, this study proposes a novel evolving registration algorithm via EMTO, where the multi-task configuration is based on the idea of solution space cutting. Concretely, one task searching in cut space assists another task with complex function landscape in escaping from local optima and enhancing successful registration ratio. To reduce unnecessary computational cost, a sparse-to-dense strategy is proposed. In addition, a novel fitness function robust to various overlap rates as well as a problem-specific metric of computational cost is introduced. Compared with 8 evolving approaches, 4 traditional approaches and 3 deep learning approaches on the object-scale and scene-scale registration datasets, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performances in terms of precision and tackling local optima.

DT Article; Early Access

AB Recent artificial intelligence advances, especially those of large language models (LLMs), have increasingly shown glimpses of human-like intelligence. This has led to bold claims that these systems are no longer a mere "it" but now a "who," a kind of person deserving respect. In this paper, I argue that this view depends on a Cartesian account of personhood, on which identifying someone as a person is based on their cognitive sophistication and ability to address common-sense reasoning problems. I contrast this with a different account of personhood, one where an agent is a person if they are autonomous, responsive to norms, and culpable for their actions. On this latter account, I show that LLMs are not person-like, as evidenced by their propensity for dishonesty, inconsistency, and offensiveness. Moreover, I argue current LLMs, given the way they are designed and trained, cannot be persons-either social or Cartesian. The upshot is that contemporary LLMs are not, and never will be, persons.

TI Taking AI risks seriously: a new assessment model for the AI Act
SO AI & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Risk assessment; Artificial intelligence; AI Act; Climate change; EU;
   IPCC
AB The EU Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) defines four risk categories: unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal. However, as these categories statically depend on broad fields of application of AI, the risk magnitude may be wrongly estimated, and the AIA may not be enforced effectively. This problem is particularly challenging when it comes to regulating general-purpose AI (GPAI), which has versatile and often unpredictable applications. Recent amendments to the compromise text, though introducing context-specific assessments, remain insufficient. To address this, we propose applying the risk categories to specific AI scenarios, rather than solely to fields of application, using a risk assessment model that integrates the AIA with the risk approach arising from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and related literature. This integrated model enables the estimation of AI risk magnitude by considering the interaction between (a) risk determinants, (b) individual drivers of determinants, and (c) multiple risk types. We illustrate this model using large language models (LLMs) as an example.

AB This study uses an artificial intelligence (AI) model to identify arbitrage opportunities in the retail marketplace. Specifically, we develop an AI model to predict the optimal purchasing point based on the price movement of products in the market. Our model is trained on a large dataset collected from an online marketplace in the United States. Our model is enhanced by incorporating user-generated content (UGC), which is empirically proven to be significantly informative. Overall, the AI model attains more than 90% precision rate, while the recall rate is higher than 80% in an out-of-sample test. In addition, we conduct a field experiment to verify the external validity of the AI model in a real-life setting. Our model identifies 293 arbitrage opportunities during a one-year field experiment and generates a profit of $7.06 per arbitrage opportunity. The result demonstrates that AI performs exceptionally well in identifying arbitrage opportunities in retail markets with tangible economic values. Our results also yield important implications regarding the role of AI in the society, both from the consumer and firm perspectives.

AB Automatic defect detection plays an important role in industrial production. Deep learning-based defect detection methods have achieved promising results. However, there are still two challenges in the current defect detection methods: 1) high-precision detection of weak defects is limited and 2) it is difficult for current defect detection methods to achieve satisfactory results dealing with strong background noise. This article proposes a dynamic weights-based wavelet attention neural network (DWWA-Net) to address these issues, which can enhance the feature representation of defects and simultaneously denoise the image, thereby improving the detection accuracy of weak defects and defects under strong background noise. First, wavelet neural networks and dynamic wavelet convolution networks (DWCNets) are presented, which can effectively filter background noise and improve model convergence. Second, a multiview attention module is designed, which can direct the network attention toward potential targets, thereby guaranteeing the accuracy for detecting weak defects. Finally, a feature feedback module is proposed, which can enhance the feature information of defects to further improve the weak defect detection accuracy. The DWWA-Net can be used for defect detection in multiple industrial fields. Experiment results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (mean precision: GC10-DET: 6.0%; NEU: 4.3%). The code is made in https://github.com/781458112/DWWA.

AB Solid research depends on systematic, verifiable and repeatable scientometric analysis. However, scientometric analysis is difficult in the current research landscape characterized by the increasing number of publications per year, intersections between research domains, and the diversity of stakeholders involved in research projects. To address this problem, we propose SciCrowd, a hybrid human-AI mixed-initiative system, which supports the collaboration between Artificial Intelligence services and crowdsourcing services. This work discusses the design and evaluation of SciCrowd. The evaluation is focused on attitudes, concerns and intentions towards use. This study contributes a nuanced understanding of the interplay between algorithmic and human tasks in the process of conducting scientometric analysis.

AB Tree-structured methods are considered one of the most powerful tools in classification and regression. Nowadays, Machine Learning for functional data is gaining great attention in different fields. Tree-based models for functional variables are limited; and therefore, there are in a need to propose an efficient classifier in this active area. The current study focuses on the supervised classification of functional data considering functional covariates and multiclass responses. The traditional binary tree approach is extended into a functional framework combining functional tree-based classification (FCT). Two data-driven approaches, including Fourier transformation and functional derivation, are conformed to process data. The conditional recursive partitioning and functional permutation test are employed to search the independence structure between functional inputs. The Bonferroni P-value adjustment and some hyperparameters are utilized to determine the optimal splitting and control tree growth. The obtained results from comprehensive simulation studies implementation are compared favorably with existing methods and showed a good performance in both of computational time and classification accuracy. Additionally, the applied electrocardiogram dataset demonstrates the usefulness and advantage of the proposed FCT method. The current study findings confirm that the proposed method is more reliable and give a high correct classification rate. Generally, this research line is promising and makes the analysis understandable and informative in the medical data classification context.

AB In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the time to share (real or fake) news items on online social media. Specifically, given the scenario where a user u is influenced on some given (real or fake) news item n by at least one of the people they follow v, we predict when the user u will re-share the news item n among their followers. We model the problem as a survival analysis task, which is a statistical analysis method aimed at predicting the time to event (the re-sharing event in our case). Survival analysis differs from other methods such as regression in that it also considers the data where the event (sharing) never occurs (censored data) in the considered time window. We considered Twitter data containing information on real and fake news shares to test our proposed survival analysis approach and modeled different aspects of the problem including user, news, and network characteristics. We show the superiority of survival analysis as compared to regression to model this problem in both the cases of real and fake news sharing.

ID ENHANCEMENT
AB Underwater images are often with biased colours and reduced contrast because of the absorption and scattering effects when light propagates in water. Such images with degradation cannot meet the needs of underwater operations. The main problem in classic underwater image restoration or enhancement methods is that they consume long calculation time, and often, the colour or contrast of the result images is still unsatisfied. Instead of using the complicated physical model of underwater imaging degradation, we propose a new method to deal with underwater images by imitating the colour constancy mechanism of human vision using double-opponency. Firstly, the original image is converted to the LMS space. Then the signals are linearly combined, and Gaussian convolutions are performed to imitate the function of receptive fields (RFs). Next, two RFs with different sizes work together to constitute the double-opponency response. Finally, the underwater light is estimated to correct the colours in the image. Further contrast stretching on the luminance is optional. Experiments show that the proposed method can obtain clarified underwater images with higher quality than before, and it spends significantly less time cost compared to other previously published typical methods.

AB This paper presents a novel method for testing Boolean expressions. It is based on spectral, aka Fourier analysis of Boolean functions which is exploited to generate test inputs. The approach has three important contributions: (i) It generates a relatively small test suite with a high capability of fault detection, (ii) The test suite is prioritized such that expected fault detection time is shorter, (iii) It is entirely mathematical relying on a simple and straightforward formula. The proposed method is formulated and evaluations are performed on both synthetic and real expressions. It is also compared with two common test generation criteria, MC/DC and Minimal MUMCUT. Evaluations show that the test suite generated by the spectral approach is relatively small while expressing the capability of a better and quicker fault detection. The approach presented in this paper provides a useful insight into how spectral/Fourier analysis of Boolean functions can be exploited in software testing.

DE Unsupervised domain adaptation; Relaxed-invariant representation;

ID CORRELATION ALIGNMENT
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at enhancing the generalizability of the classification model learned from the labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. An established approach to UDA is to constrain the classifier on an intermediate representation that is distributionally invariant across domains. However, recent theoretical and empirical research has revealed that relying only on invariance fails to guarantee a small target error, thus making equality in the distribution of representations unnecessary. In this paper, we propose to relax invariant representation learning by finding a general relationship between the source and target representations, which allows an interchange of the more discriminative domain information. To this end, we formalize the MapFlow framework, which explicitly constructs an invertible mapping between the target encoded distribution and variationally induced source representation. Empirical results on public benchmark datasets show the desirable performance of our proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper investigates the local exponential synchronization for discrete-time neural networks containing the time-varying delay via the memory-based saturated controller. Using the modified sector condition, the augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and two recent inequalities, a synchronization criterion is first obtained by means of linear matrix inequalities such that the closed-loop error dynamics is locally exponentially stable. For the constant delay case, a simplified criterion is also proposed. Then, the optimization problems concerning the admissible initial condition set are specifically formulated. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate the validity and reduced conservatism of the obtained results.

TI EfficientU-Net: A Novel Deep Learning Method for Breast Tumor
   Segmentation and Classification in Ultrasound Images
SO NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Breast cancer; Ultrasound; Deep learning; Unet; Segmentation;
   Classification
AB Segmentation and classification of breast tumors in ultrasound (US) images is an important application to deep neural networks. Unet architecture is recently developed for image segmentation. However, the standard convolution used in the Unet architecture can lead to problems such as loss of information, capturing irrelevant features, and failing to accurately localize the boundary of the segmented parts in an image. Additionally, the model involves a large number of parameters, leading to high computational time. This work proposes a novel deep-learning method called EfficientU-Net for breast tumor segmentation in ultrasound (US) images. The method addresses the above challenges by integrating a modified EfficientNet with an atrous convolution (AC) block in the encoder part of the Unet model. The EfficientNet uses depth-wise separable convolution to minimize training parameters and capture relevant texture features to localize the tumor boundary accurately. The AC block handles the diversity in the shape and size of tumors. The classification network based on the pre-trained CNN architecture and fine-tuned using a custom neural network is developed. The classification network is used to classify the generated masks into benign, malignant, and normal classes. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two publicly available US image datasets, BUSI and dataset-B. The proposed method demonstrates a reduction in the number of parameters, a decrease in computational complexity, and a hike in inference speed while achieving superior performance in terms of segmentation and classification metrics.

AB In the real market, the item's demand is substantially affected by the item's selling price and frequency of advertising. This study focuses on an optimal ordering policy followed by advertising, pricing, and preservation policies. The present study incorporates the quantity-dependent ordering cost and time-dependent holding cost. A partial prepayment scheme is developed for inventory purchase decisions. The spoilage impact can be effectively reduced by an optimal investment in refrigeration. The optimal decision policy has been proposed by using three metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization, real-coded genetic algorithm, and differential evolution algorithm. A comparison is made for these metaheuristic schemes based on the numerical illustrations. The parameter sensitivity is performed to get insights of the variability in the indicators of the inventory model.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article; Early Access
DE fuzzy logic; image classification; image segmentation; neural nets
AB Image segmentation is pivotal for the understanding of high-resolution remote sensing images (HRRS). However, because of the inherent uncertainties in remote sensing images and the highly complex resolution of HRRS, ambiguity often occurs among some geographic entities in the segmentation process, and the fine segmentation of HRRS is not considered sufficiently for most existing segmentation methods. Therefore, in this paper, the authors propose a new collaborative neural network structure called fuzzy deep learning conditional random field network (FCUnet) to solve the refined segmentation of HRRS. First, the authors design a fuzzy U-Net classification network to obtain effective feature information, which introduces the fuzzy logic unit into the network to process the ambiguity and uncertainty of HRRS. Then, the authors introduce the conditional random field (CRF) at the end of FCUnet to optimize the image segmentation results. Finally, the authors validated the effectiveness and superiority of their approach on three data sets. The experiment results revealed that FCUnet had better refined segmentation performance and generalization ability than state-of-the-art methods.

ID DOMAIN ADAPTATION
AB By leveraging the labeled data samples of the source domain to learn the unlabeled data samples of the target domain, unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) has achieved promising performance. However, it is still a vital problem for unsupervised domain adaptation to deal with cross-domain distribution mismatch. Therefore, we present a new model framework for cross-domain image classification in the paper, which is termed manifold transfer subspace learning based on double relaxed discriminative regression (MTSL-DRDR). First, the global geometry information of the samples from the source and target domain can be preserved by utilizing the low-rank constraint. Second, the two transformation projections are employed to project both domains to a unified subspace, in which each data sample of the target domain can be represented by some samples from the source domain with the sparse and low-rank coefficient matrix. Third, the local structure information of the data points with the same semantics from the different domains is preserved by means of the adaptive weight graph based on the low-rank coefficient matrix. Last, for fully use the discriminative information of data from the source domain, the discriminant information of the source domain based on intra-class and inter-class graphs is encoded to the target domain. Our MTSL-DRDR algorithm is evaluated on challenging benchmark datasets, and a large number of experiment results show the superiority of the proposed method.

AB To meet the production demand of workshop, this paper proposes an efficient discrete artificial bee colony (DABC) algorithm to solve a new automatic guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem with delivery and pickup in a matrix manufacturing workshop. The goal is to produce a AGV transportation solution that minimizes the total cost, including travel cost, time cost, and AGV cost. Therefore, a mixed integer linear programming model is established. To improve the transportation efficiency, a dynamic calculation method is developed. In the DABC algorithm, a heuristic algorithm and a median based probability selection method are used. For improving the quality of the solutions, four effective neighborhood operators are introduced. In the local search, a rule is given to save the operation time and a problem-based search operator is proposed to improve the quality of the best individual. Finally, a series of comparison experiments were implemented with the iterative greedy algorithm, artificial bee colony algorithm, hybrid fruit fly optimization algorithm, discrete artificial bee colony algorithm, improved harmony search, and hybrid genetic-sweep algorithm. The results show that the proposed DABC algorithm has high performance on solving the delivery and pickup problem.

AB Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is an important tool for intelligent ocean applications, which can be applied to detect underwater environment and search target. Path planning is the key technology to realize AUV intelligence, which has important research significance. Aiming at the dynamic path planning problem, the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) was first applied to the AUV three-dimensional (3D) dynamic path planning, and a Gate Recurrent Unit Proximal Policy Optimization with Local Vision (GPPO-LV) model based on local vision is proposed. The 3D ocean current environment is constructed based on the ROMS simulation data. The local vision matrix is constructed based on underwater images, and the features of local vision are extracted using convolutional neural network. Furthermore, Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is used to mine the hidden information between observation states. Finally, the Actor network for strategy output and the Critical network for action value evaluation are constructed, and strategies are optimized in the process of interaction with the environment. The experiment shows that under various unknown environments, AUV can carry out real-time path planning under real ocean current data, and has good obstacle avoidance ability.

AB In this work, a neural surface reconstruction framework is presented. In order to perform neural surface reconstruction using 2D supervision, a weighted random sampling based on saliency is introduced for training the deep neural network. In the proposed method, self-attention is used to detect the saliency of input 2D images. The saliency map, that is, the weight matrix of the weighted random sampling, is used to sample the training samples. As a result, more samples in the reconstructed object area are collected. Moreover, an update strategy for weight based on sampling frequency is adopted to avoid the points that cannot be sampled all the time. The experiments are implemented in real-world 2D images of objects with different material properties and lighting conditions based on the DTU dataset. The results show that the proposed method produces more detailed 3D surfaces, and the rendered results are closer to the raw images visually. In addition, the mean of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PNSR) is also improved.

AB As a high-order neural network, the Pi-sigma neural network has demonstrated its capacities for fast learning and strong nonlinear processing. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed for Pi-sigma neural networks with entropy error functions based on L-0 regularization. One of the key features of the proposed algorithm is the use of an entropy error function instead of the more common square error function, which is different from those in most existing literature. At the same time, the proposed algorithm also employs L-0 regularization as a means of ensuring the efficiency of the network. Based on the gradient method, the monotonicity, and strong and weak convergence of the network are strictly proved by theoretical analysis and experimental verification. Experiments on applying the proposed algorithm to both classification and regression problems have demonstrated the improved performance of the algorithm.

LA English
DT Article
DE NIR images; Image colorization; Generative adversarial network; Limited
   data
AB With large amount of training data, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based methods have made great progress for colorizing visible grayscale images. However, existing models rarely consider colorizing near-infrared (NIR) images, which are usually captured with less color or texture information. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework to recover visible color for NIR images with limited data. Firstly, we propose a grayscale preprocessing network to cope with the visual blur and low contrast in NIR gray images, which provides grayscale image as close as the ground truth of visible ones. For the second stage, i.e., image colorization, a novel bilateral Res-Unet network is proposed to transfer color features on both sides of the encoder and decoder to improve the semantic correctness of the colored image. To deal with limited data, a feature memory module is adopted to memorize the color features of training images, providing color conditions for the colorization network. Furthermore, a multi-feature semantic perception loss is reformulated to make the final results with more semantic information and increases the vividness and naturalness. To verify the proposed method, we conduct various experiments on four limited datasets and achieve state-of-the-art against existing CNN-based methods.

AB The distribution of emergency shelter materials in emergency cases around the world is a hard task, the goal of this research is to offer a Complex Non-linear Diophantine Fuzzy (C-NLDF) decision-making model for earthquake shelter construction. Essentially, the article is divided into three sections to acquire acceptable and precise measures in emergency decision-making situations. First, we present the Complex Non-Linear Diophantine Fuzzy Set (CN-LDFS), a new generalization of the complex linear Diophantine fuzzy set (CLDFS) and q-linear Diophantine fuzzy set (q-LDFS), as well as explore its key aspects. Furthermore, aggregation operators are useful for aggregating uncertainty in decision-making issues. As a result, algebraic norms for CN-LDFSs are produced based on certain operational laws. In the second section of the work, we offer a series of averaging and geometric aggregation operators under CN-LDFS that are based on defined operating laws. In the final section of the work, under complex Non-linear Diophantine fuzzy information, the ranking algorithms based on suggested aggregation operators are present to address the case study regarding emergency situation of earthquakes. In comparison section, results of existing and proposed operators explore the effectiveness of proposed methodologies and provide accurate emergency measures to address the global uncertainty about the construction of emergency shelters in earthquakes.

DT Article; Early Access
DE convolutional neural nets; pose estimation
AB The 2D human pose estimation plays an important role in human-computer interaction and action recognition. Although the method based on high-resolution network has superior performance, there is still room for improvement in terms of speed and lightweight. Here, a LiteDEKR, a 2D pose estimation method that combines lightweight and accuracy, is proposed by designing a lightweight network based on DEKR and constructing two scientifically valid loss functions. The method, constructs a multi-instance bias regression loss that matches the true distribution of keypoint bias, improves the accuracy of bias regression, and constructs a keypoint similarity loss with the object keypoint similarity index of keypoints as the optimization objective to achieve end-to-end training of the network. In addition, this paper has designed a lightweight DEKR, using LitePose as the backbone network. With the optimization of the above two loss functions, LiteDEKR not only achieves lightweight but also has high accuracy. Comparative experiments on the COCO and CrowdPose datasets show that compared to the current state-of-the-art Contextual Instance Decoupling, LiteDEKR achieves a similar accuracy with only 10% of its network complexity. It also shows better robustness to low-resolution input images.

TI Camouflaged Object Segmentation with Omni Perception
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DE Camouflage; Segmentation; Perception; Attention
ID SALIENT; NETWORK
AB Camouflaged object segmentation (COS) is a very challenging task due to the deceitful appearances of the candidate objects to the noisy backgrounds. Most existing state-of-the-art methods mimic the first-positioning-then-focus mechanism of predators, but still fail in positioning camouflaged objects in cluttered scenes or delineating their boundaries. The key reason is that their methods do not have a comprehensive understanding of the scene when they spot and focus on the objects, so that they are easily attracted by local surroundings. An ideal COS model should be able to process local and global information at the same time, i.e., to have omni perception of the scene through the whole process of camouflaged object segmentation. To this end, we propose to learn the omni perception for the first-positioning-then-focus COS scheme. Specifically, we propose an omni perception network (OPNet) with two novel modules, i.e., the pyramid positioning module (PPM) and dual focus module (DFM). They are proposed to integrate local features and global representations for accurate positioning of the camouflaged objects and focus on their boundaries, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, which runs at 54 fps, significantly outperforms 15 cutting-edge models on 4 challenging datasets under 4 standard metrics. The code will be made publicly available.

AB Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) aims to tune hyperparameters for a system in order to improve the predictive performance. Typically, only the hyperparameter configuration with the best performance is chosen after performing several trials. However, some works try to take advantage of the effort made when training all the models with every hyperparameter configuration trial and, instead of discarding all but one, they propose performing an ensemble of all the models. However, this ensemble consists of simply averaging the model predictions or weighting the models by a certain probability. Recently, some of the so-called Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks have included other more sophisticated ensemble strategies, such as the Caruana method or the stacking strategy. On the one hand, the Caruana method has been shown to perform well in HPO ensemble, since it is not affected by the issues caused by multicollinearity, which is prevalent in HPO. It just computes the average over a subset of predictions, previously chosen through a forward stepwise selection with replacement. But it does not benefit from the generalization power of a learning process. On the other hand, stacking approaches include a learning procedure since a meta-learner is required to perform the ensemble. Yet, one hardly finds advice about which meta-learner can be adequate. Besides, some possible meta-learners may suffer from problems caused by multicollinearity or need to be tuned in order to mitigate or reduce this obstacle. In an attempt to reduce this lack of advice, this paper exhaustively explores possible meta-learners for stacking ensemble in HPO, free of hyperparameter tuning and able to mitigate the problems derived from multicollinearity as well as taking advantage of the generalization power that a learning process may include in the ensemble. Particularly, the boosting strategy shows promise in this context as a stacking meta-learner, since it satisfies the required conditions. In addition, boosting is even able to completely remove the effects of multicollinearity. This paper provides advice on how to use boosting as a meta-learner in the stacking ensemble. In any case, its main contribution is to propose an implicit regularization in the classical boosting algorithm and a novel non-parametric stop criterion suitable only for boosting and specifically designed for the HPO context. The existing synergy between these two improvements performed over boosting exhibits competitive and promising predictive power performance as a stacking meta-learner in HPO compared to other existing meta-learners and ensemble approaches for HPO other than the stacking ensemble. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID INFORMATION
AB Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is instructive in drug design and disease treatment. Existing studies typically used the properties of nodes (drug chemical structure and protein sequence) to con-struct drug and target features while ignoring the influence of network topology information on the pre-diction of DTIs. In this study, a hybrid computation model is proposed to predict DTIs based on the network topological feature representation embedded the deep forest model (NTFRDF). The main idea is to capture the topological differences by learning the low-dimensional feature representation of drugs and targets from the heterogeneous network. In addition, the multi-similarity fusion strategy is proposed to mine hidden useful information in the known DTIs from multi-view to enrich network features of the heterogeneous network. Based on the deep forest framework, the performance of the proposed method is examined on four benchmark datasets. Our experimental results verify that the proposed method is com-petitive compared with some existing DTIs prediction models.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Crime event analysis (CEA) has become increasingly important in assisting humans in preventing future crimes. A fundamental challenge in the research community lies in the dynamics of criminal intents. Offenders' criminal intents may evolve due to their surroundings, making it difficult for machine learning models to capture them from limited existing information, leading to model uncertainty. As a result, there has been a surge of works exploiting various information related to the evolution of criminal intents, thus enhancing prediction accuracy. This work conducts a comprehensive survey of the past decade (2013-2023) of CEA methods from the perspective of information fusion. We first investigate the categories of crime data and briefly introduce existing CEA tasks as well as evaluation metrics. Then, fusion is systematically reviewed from the bases of multi-modal data, features and machine learning models in terms of different categories of crime data. Finally, we conclude by highlighting some limitations and identifying several future research directions.

AB Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging task that aims to transfer a model trained on base classes with adequate labeled data to accommodate novel classes with only a few training examples. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective weighted prototype estimation (WPE) method to improve FSL. We assume that similar classes have similar distributions in the feature space so that the prototypes of novel classes can be estimated by transferring information from their similar base classes. Specifically, the proposed method learns the Gaussian-like feature distributions of similar base classes with sufficient samples and then transfers the learned distributions to cali-brate the prototype of the novel class, which is weighted by its similarities. With the estimated prototype, more robust samples can be generated to improve the FSL task. Comparative experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on three benchmark FSL datasets. The results show that our proposed method can generate more robust samples and significantly improve FSL, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on these datasets.

AB The primary goal is to define conditional belief functions in the Dempster-Shafer theory. We do so similarly to probability theory's notion of conditional probability tables. Conditional belief functions are necessary for constructing directed graphical belief function models in the same sense as conditional probability tables are necessary for constructing Bayesian networks. We provide examples of conditional belief functions, including those obtained by Smets' conditional embedding. Besides defining conditional belief functions, we state and prove a few basic properties of conditionals. In the belief-function literature, conditionals are defined starting from a joint belief function. Conditionals are then defined using the removal operator, an inverse of Dempster's combination operator. When such conditionals are well-defined belief functions, we show that our definition is equivalent to these definitions.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising method for gaining perception and common sense from unlabelled data. Existing approaches to analyzing human body skeletons address the problem similar to SSL models for image and video understanding, but pixel data is far more challenging than coordinates. This paper presents ATOM, an SSL model designed for skeleton-based data analysis. Unlike video-based SSL approaches, ATOM leverages atomic movements within skeleton actions to achieve a more fine-grained representation. The pro-posed architecture predicts the action order at the frame level, leading to improved perceptions and represen-tations of each action. ATOM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in two well-known datasets (NTU RGB + D and NTU-120 RGB + D), and its weight transferability enables performance improvements on supervised and semi-supervised tasks, up to 4.4% (3.3% p.p.) and 14.1% (6.3% p.p.), respectively, in Top-1 Accuracy.

AB High-resolution trajectory data from the intersection shared space (ISS) is an ideal resource for testing autonomous driving and studying microscopic traffic flow theory in urban road traffic environments. It is common to use computer vision (CV) technologies to extract trajectory data from camera recordings at the ISS. However, it is challenging to accurately extract non-motorized (NONM) trajectories due to vehicle occlusion and mutual interference, which cause trajectory noise and missing. This study proposed a novel NONM trajectory reconstruction method, which integrates the social force model with the particle filter to reduce trajectory noise. The approach was tested on trajectories extracted from two advanced CV algorithms (ie, Yolov7 and MASK RCNN), and its performance was compared with seven SOTA methods. The results show that the proposed method achieved a much better RMSE (0.6 meters) than both the baseline (unprocessed CV trajectories, the RMSE is 1.16 meters) and selected SOTA methods (the best RMSE is 0.78 meters). The contribution of the study is to enhance the classical noise reduction algorithm by introducing the driving interaction model; ablation experiments and sensitivity analysis further demonstrate the importance of the driving interaction model in reducing trajectory noise and the stability of the method. The approach also includes an LSTM-Hungarian part to make up the missing trajectory. The proposed method is expected to serve as a useful post-processing tool for current CV algorithms.

AB The human genome complexity is captured by many signals, representing for instance DNA variations, the expression of gene activity, or DNA's structural rearrangements; a rich set of data types and formats is used to record these signals. Conceptual models can support the description and explanation of the genome's elaborate structure and behavior. Among others, the Conceptual Schema of the Human Genome (CSG) provides a concept-oriented, top-down representation of the genome behavior, which is independent of data formats. The Genomic Conceptual Model (GCM) provides instead a data-oriented, bottom-up representation, targeting a well-organized, unified description of these formats. In this research, we join the two approaches to achieve PoliViews, a comprehensive model that links (1) a concepts layer, describing genome elements and their conceptual connections, with (2) a data layer, describing datasets derived from genome sequencing with specific technologies. Their dynamic connection is established when specific genomic data types are chosen in the data layer, thereby triggering the selection of a view in the concepts layer. The benefit is mutual: data records can be semantically described by high-level concepts exploiting their links and, in turn, the continuously evolving abstract model can be extended thanks to the input provided by real datasets. PoliViews enables expressing queries that employ a holistic conceptual perspective on the genome, directly translated onto data-oriented terms and organization. Here, we demonstrate the approach by linking two major genomic data types, namely DNA variation and gene expression. For each type, we consider different eminent data sources; we describe their mapping with the corresponding view in the concepts layer, enabling an intra-data-type integration. Then, leveraging on the connections available in the concepts layer, we show how the distinct data types can be interoperated, enabling an inter-data-type integration. The PoliViews approach is shown through several examples of biological interest and can be further extended to any kind of genomic information.

AB The importance of hierarchical image organization has been witnessed by a wide spectrum of applications in computer vision and graphics. Different from image segmentation with the spatial whole-part consideration, this work designs a modern framework for disassembling an image into a family of derived signals from a scale-space perspective. Specifically, we first formulate the goal of the hierarchical image organization problem. Then, by concerning desired properties, such as peeling hierarchy and structure preservation, we convert the original complex problem into a series of two-component separation sub-problems, significantly reducing the complexity. The proposed framework is flexible to be trained on both paired and unpaired data. A compact recurrent network, namely hierarchical image peeling net, is customized to efficiently and effectively fulfill the task, which is about 3.5Mb in size, and can handle 1080p images in more than 60 fps per recurrence on a GTX 2080Ti GPU, making it attractive for practical use. Both theoretical findings and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, reveal its superiority over other state-ofthe-art alternatives, and show its potential to various applicable scenarios.

AB Baseline drift problem usually exists in the spectral analysis due to the detector nonlinearities and temperature variations. Therefore, the baseline must be corrected before accurate data analysis. So, we proposed a novel and high-precise algorithm, baseline estimation using morphological and iterative local extremum (MILE). We first obtained all local extrema of the measured spectrum by derivation. A coarse baseline is then estimated by the PCHIP interpolation method. Subsequently, find the local extrema again of coarse baseline and update by their adjacent data. The update processing iterates multiple times. Finally, the spectrum is corrected by subtracting the estimated baseline. In order to evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we corrected the baseline drift of various spectra, including chromatograms and Fourier Transform Spectrometer spectra. All results achieve a high precision, proving that our algorithm has better accuracy and robustness.

DT Article; Early Access
DE ~Adversarial learning; contrastive learning; data augmentation;
   electrocardiogram (ECG)
AB Extracting invariant representations in unlabeled electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is a challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs). Contrastive learning is a promising method for unsupervised learning. However, it should improve its robustness to noise and learn the spatiotemporal and semantic representations of categories, just like cardiologists. This article proposes a patient-level adversarial spatiotemporal contrastive learning (ASTCL) framework, which includes ECG augmentations, an adversarial module, and a spatiotemporal contrastive module. Based on the ECG noise attributes, two distinct but effective ECG augmentations, ECG noise enhancement, and ECG noise denoising, are introduced. These methods are beneficial for ASTCL to enhance the robustness of the DNN to noise. This article proposes a self-supervised task to increase the antiperturbation ability. This task is represented as a game between the discriminator and encoder in the adversarial module, which pulls the extracted representations into the shared distribution between the positive pairs to discard the perturbation representations and learn the invariant representations. The spatiotemporal contrastive module combines spatiotemporal prediction and patient discrimination to learn the spatiotemporal and semantic representations of categories. To learn category representations effectively, this article only uses patient-level positive pairs and alternately uses the predictor and the stop-gradient to avoid model collapse. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, various groups of experiments are conducted on four ECG benchmark datasets and one clinical dataset compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results showed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI Probabilistic Keyphrase Generation From Copy and Generating Spaces

DE ~Gaussian mixture model (GMM); keyphrase generation; variational
   encoder-decoder (VED); von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution
ID EXTRACTION
AB Keyphrase generation is one of the most fundamental tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Most existing works on keyphrase generation mainly focus on using holistic distribution to optimize the negative log-likelihood loss, but they do not directly manipulate the copy and generating spaces, which may reduce the generability of the decoder. Additionally, existing keyphrase models are either unable to determine the dynamic numbers of keyphrases or produce the number of keyphrases implicitly. In this article, we propose a probabilistic keyphrase generation model from copy and generating spaces. The proposed model is built upon the vanilla variational encoder-decoder (VED) framework. On top of VED, two separate latent variables are adopted to model the distribution of data within the latent copy and generating spaces, respectively. Specifically, we adopt a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to obtain a condensed variable for modifying the generating probability distribution over the predefined vocabulary. Meanwhile, we utilize a clustering module, which is designed to promote Gaussian Mixture learning and subsequently extract a latent variable for the copy probability distribution. Moreover, we utilize a natural property of the Gaussian mixture network and use the number of filtered components to determine the number of keyphrases. The approach is trained based on latent variable probabilistic modeling, neural variational inference, and self-supervised learning. Experiments on social media and scientific article datasets outperform the state-of-the-art baselines in generating accurate predictions and controllable keyphrase numbers.

AB Writer identification based on handwriting recognition is considered one of the most common research areas in pattern recognition and biometrics. It has attracted much attention in recent decades due to the urgent need to develop biometric systems for many security applications. In this paper, Deep Writer Identification Network (DeepWINet), an effective deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for writer identification, is proposed. The proposed model is evaluated in two different ways. In the first scenario, DeepWINet's CNN activation features, computed from the connected components of the writing, are passed to a customized nearest neighbor classifier for writer identification. In the second scenario, DeepWINet is evaluated as an end-to-end CNN network where the predicted results are averaged using an efficient strategy, Score Averaging Component-Decision Combiner. The proposed approach achieves competitive or the highest State-Of-The-Art performance on eight challenging handwritten databases with different languages.

ID SUBSPACE SEGMENTATION
AB Multiple kernel k-means clustering (MKKC) is proposed to efficiently incorporate multiple base kernels to generate an optimal kernel. However, many existing MKKC methods all involve two stages: learning a clustering indicator matrix and performing clustering on it. This cannot ensure the ultimate clustering results are optimal because the optimal values of two steps are not equivalent to those of the original problem. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method named multiple kernel k-means clustering with block diagonal property (MKKC-BD). It is the first time to find the relationship between an indicator matrix and Laplacian matrix of the graph theory and get a block diagonal (BD) representation of the indicator matrix. By imposing the BD constraint on the indicator matrix, the BD property of the indicator matrix is ensured. Further, the explicit clustering results are generated directly from the unified framework integrating the three processes of learning an optimal kernel, an indicator matrix and clustering results, which shows the clustering task is executed just by one step. In addition, a simple kernel weight strategy is used in this framework to obtain the optimal kernel, where the value of each kernel weight directly reveals the relationship of each base kernel and the optimal kernel. Finally, by extensive experiments on ten data sets and comparison of clustering results with eight state-of-the-art multiple kernel clustering methods, it is concluded that MKKC-BD is effective.

TI Three-Stage Global Channel Pruning for Resources-Limited Platform
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Channel pruning; layer protection; sparsity training
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in many fields, and deploying them on resource-limited devices has drawn more and more attention in industry and academia. Typically, there are great challenges for intelligent networked vehicles and drones to deploy object detection tasks due to the limited memory and computing power of embedded devices. To meet these challenges, hardware-friendly model compression approaches are required to reduce model parameters and computation. Three-stage global channel pruning, which involves sparsity training, channel pruning, and fine-tuning, is very popular in the field of model compression for its hardware-friendly structural pruning and ease of implementation. However, existing methods suffer from problems such as uneven sparsity, damage to the network structure, and reduced pruning ratio due to channel protection. To solve these issues, the present article makes the following significant contributions. First, we present an element-level heatmap-guided sparsity training method to achieve even sparsity, resulting in higher pruning ratio and improved performance. Second, we propose a global channel pruning method that fuses both global and local channel importance metrics to identify unimportant channels for pruning. Third, we present a channel replacement policy (CRP) to protect layers, ensuring that the pruning ratio can be guaranteed even under high pruning rate conditions. Evaluations show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of pruning efficiency, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-limited devices.

DE Mini-batch entanglement; Nash equilibrium; neural architecture game;
   neural architecture search (NAS); Parrondo's paradox
AB Modeling the architecture search process on a supernet and applying a differentiable method to find the importance of architecture are among the leading tools for differentiable neural architectures search (DARTS). One fundamental problem in DARTS is how to discretize or select a single-path architecture from the pretrained one-shot architecture. Previous approaches mainly exploit heuristic or progressive search methods for discretization and selection, which are not efficient and easily trapped by local optimizations. To address these issues, we formulate the task of finding a proper single-path architecture as an architecture game among the edges and operations with the strategies "keep" and "drop" and show that the optimal one-shot architecture is a Nash equilibrium of the architecture game. Then, we propose a novel and effective approach for discretizing and selecting a proper single-path architecture, which is based on extracting the single-path architecture that associates the maximal coefficient of the Nash equilibrium with the strategy "keep" in the architecture game. To further improve the efficiency, we employ a mechanism of entangled Gaussian representation of mini-batches, inspired by the classic Parrondo's paradox. If some mini-batch formed uncompetitive strategies, the entanglement of mini-batches would ensure the games be combined and, thus, turn into strong ones. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art progressive discretizing methods while maintaining competitive performance with higher maximum accuracy.

ID NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION
AB Microseismic signal reconstruction from complex nonrandom noise is challenging, especially when the signal is disrupted or completely covered by strong field noise. Various methods often assume that signals are laterally coherent or the noise is predictable. In this article, we propose a dual convolutional neural network preceded by a low-rank structure extraction module to reconstruct signals hidden by strong complex field noise. Preconditioning by low-rank structure extraction is the first step in removing high-energy regular noise. The module is followed by two convolutional neural networks with different complexity to achieve better signal reconstruction and noise removal. In addition to the combination of synthetic and field microseismic data, natural images are also used in the training due to their correlation, complexity, and completeness, which contributes to increasing the generalization of the networks. The results from synthetic and real datasets demonstrate superior signal recovery, which cannot be achieved by using solely deep learning, low-rank structure extraction, or curvelet thresholding. Algorithmic generalization is demonstrated using independently acquired array data excluded during training.

ID PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION
AB Image fusion technology aims to obtain a comprehensive image containing a specific target or detailed information by fusing data of different modalities. However, many deep learning-based algorithms consider edge texture information through loss functions instead of specifically constructing network modules. The influence of the middle layer features is ignored, which leads to the loss of detailed information between layers. In this article, we propose a multidiscriminator hierarchical wavelet generative adversarial network (MHW-GAN) for multimodal image fusion. First, we construct a hierarchical wavelet fusion (HWF) module as the generator of MHW-GAN to fuse feature information at different levels and scales, which avoids information loss in the middle layers of different modalities. Second, we design an edge perception module (EPM) to integrate edge information from different modalities to avoid the loss of edge information. Third, we leverage the adversarial learning relationship between the generator and three discriminators for constraining the generation of fusion images. The generator aims to generate a fusion image to fool the three discriminators, while the three discriminators aim to distinguish the fusion image and edge fusion image from two source images and the joint edge image, respectively. The final fusion image contains both intensity information and structure information via adversarial learning. Experiments on public and self-collected four types of multimodal image datasets show that the proposed algorithm is superior to the previous algorithms in terms of both subjective and objective evaluation.

AB Information security has become an inseparable aspect of the field of information technology as a result of advancements in the industry. Authentication is crucial when it comes to dealing with security. A user must be identified using biometrics based on certain physiological and behavioral markers. To validate or establish the identification of an individual requesting their services, a variety of systems require trustworthy personal recognition schemes. The goal of such systems is to ensure that the offered services are only accessible by authorized users and not by others. This case study provides enhanced accuracy for multimodal biometric authentication based on voice and face hence, reducing the equal error rate. The proposed scheme utilizes the Gaussian mixture model for voice recognition, FaceNet model for face recognition and score level fusion to determine the identity of the user. The results reveal that the proposed scheme has the lowest equal error rate in comparison to the previous work.

AB An immense volume of digital documents exists online and offline with content that can offer useful information and insights. Utilizing topic modeling enhances the analysis and understanding of digital documents. Topic modeling discovers latent semantic structures or topics within a set of digital textual documents. The Internet of Things, Blockchain, recommender system, and search engine optimization applications use topic modeling to handle data mining tasks, such as classification and clustering. The usefulness of topic models depends on the quality of resulting term patterns and topics with high quality. Topic coherence is the standard metric to measure the quality of topic models. Previous studies build topic models to generally work on conventional documents, and they are insufficient and underperform when applied to web content data due to differences in the structure of the conventional and HTML documents. Neglecting the unique structure of web content leads to missing otherwise coherent topics and, therefore, low topic quality. This study aims to propose an innovative topic model to learn coherence topics in web content data. We present the HTML Topic Model (HTM), a web content topic model that takes into consideration the HTML tags to understand the structure of web pages. We conducted two series of experiments to demonstrate the limitations of the existing topic models and examine the topic coherence of the HTM against the widely used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model and its variants, namely the Correlated Topic Model, the Dirichlet Multinomial Regression, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process, the Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the pseudo-document based Topic Model, and the Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation models. The first experiment demonstrates the limitations of the existing topic models when applied to web content data and, therefore, the essential need for a web content topic model. When applied to web data, the overall performance dropped an average of five times and, in some cases, up to approximately 20 times lower than when applied to conventional data. The second experiment then evaluates the effectiveness of the HTM model in discovering topics and term patterns of web content data. The HTM model achieved an overall 35% improvement in topic coherence compared to the LDA.

AB Semantic segmentation for extracting buildings and roads from uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images by deep learning becomes a more efficient and convenient method than traditional manual segmentation in surveying and mapping fields. In order to make the model lightweight and improve the model accuracy, a lightweight network using object attention (LOANet) for buildings and roads from UAV aerial remote sensing images is proposed. The proposed network adopts an encoder-decoder architecture in which a lightweight densely connected network (LDCNet) is developed as the encoder. In the decoder part, the dual multi-scale context modules which consist of the atrous spatial pyramid pooling module (ASPP) and the object attention module (OAM) are designed to capture more context information from feature maps of UAV remote sensing images. Between ASPP and OAM, a feature pyramid network (FPN) module is used to fuse multi-scale features extracted from ASPP. A private dataset of remote sensing images taken by UAV which contains 2431 training sets, 945 validation sets, and 475 test sets is constructed. The proposed basic model performs well on this dataset, with only 1.4M parameters and 5.48G floating point operations (FLOPs), achieving excellent mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU). Further experiments on the publicly available LoveDA and CITY-OSM datasets have been conducted to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed basic and large model, and outstanding mIoU results have been achieved. All codes are available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/LOANet.

AB Supply chain (SC) networks now need to submit structural adjustments to respond to events like natural and unanticipated disasters that tend to cause interruptions and damage the continuity of business operations. Artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, 3D printing, 5G, and the Internet of Things are just a few examples of disruptive technologies that are being widely used and will drastically alter how SCs sustainability is conducted in the real world. The sustainability of SC operations can be greatly enhanced by disruptive technology. Organizational competency is needed to strike a balance between sustainability and SC disruption. Sustainable SCs may not have enough resilience to survive disruptive events since they prioritize efficiency and economic aspects. That is why sustainable SC management studies trends toward disruption utilizing new technologies. To adapt SCs to the needs of contemporary manufacturing processes, innovations in environmental conservation and social development have been put into place. In contrast, even though the fact that sustainability and disruptive technologies have each been extensively examined separately, few suggestions combine them in the measuring of SC performance. Since there are not any studies in the literature that identify the influence of disruptive technologies on SC sustainability generally, in this research we concentrate on several disruptive technologies that are used to provide SC sustainability. The objective of this work's suggestion is to provide a framework that integrates multi-criteria analysis methods with neutrosophic theory to evaluate the influence of disruptive technologies on the sustainability of SCs. This framework is an integration of the a-discounting technique for multi-criteria decision-making (alpha-D MCDM) and the Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method. The new alpha-D MCDM approach overcomes the analytical hierarchy process's (AHP) method limitations of pairwise comparison to n-wise comparisons and also deals with inconsistent problems. SC sustainability has three main criteria which are economic, environmental, and social, their weights are measured using alpha-D MCDM with n-wise comparison. Also, the twenty sub-criteria weights were evaluated using the standard AHP method with consistent comparison. To rank the disruptive technologies that influence SC sustainability, we utilize the VIKOR method. The proposed framework is applied under a neutrosophic environment to ensure more accurate results and deal with uncertainty and vague conditions. Finally, sensitivity and comparative analyses were performed to confirm the verity, strength, and stability of the enhanced methodology.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES
AB This paper introduces a multi-objective variant of the marine predators algorithm (MPA) called the multi-objective improved marine predators algorithm (MOIMPA), which incorporates concepts from Quantum theory. By leveraging Quantum theory, the MOIMPA aims to enhance the MPA's ability to balance between exploration and exploitation and find optimal solutions. The algorithm utilizes a concept inspired by the Schrodinger wave function to determine the position of particles in the search space. This modification improves both exploration and exploitation, resulting in enhanced performance. Additionally, the proposed MOIMPA incorporates the Pareto dominance mechanism. It stores non-dominated Pareto optimal solutions in a repository and employs a roulette wheel strategy to select solutions from the repository, considering their coverage. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MOIMPA, tests are conducted on various benchmark functions, including ZDT and DTLZ, as well as using the evolutionary computation 2009 (CEC'09) test suite. The algorithm is also evaluated on engineering design problems. A comparison is made between the proposed multi-objective approach and other well-known evolutionary optimization methods, such as MOMPA, multi-objective ant lion optimizer, and multi-objective multi-verse optimization. The statistical results demonstrate the robustness of the MOIMPA approach, as measured by metrics like inverted generational distance, generalized distance, spacing, and delta. Furthermore, qualitative experimental results confirm that MOIMPA provides highly accurate approximations of the true Pareto fronts.

AB As the volume of waste generated by human activities continues to rise, the need for effective and sustainable solid waste management methods becomes increasingly important. Traditional approaches, such as landfilling and incineration, can have negative impacts on the environment and human health. Waste management sustainability research can benefit from the use of cosine similarity, a mathematical technique that measures the similarity between two vectors. To address this issue, innovative approaches, such as the use of cubic m-polar fuzzy cosine similarity measures (CmPF), are being explored. In this scenario, the membership grade (MG) is represented by a fuzzy interval, while the non-membership grade (NMG) is stated by a fuzzy number. An m-polar fuzzy set (mPFS) allots m different numbers of MGs to each of the possibilities that assist compensate for the universal set. A CmPF similarity can deal directly with single and multipolar data in an environment that is cubical. There are numerous distinct uses for similarity measures (SMs) in a range of domains. As a result, three unique cosine similarity metrics for CmPFSs are shown in each SM. These measurements utilize the cosine angle between two vectors, a unique distance measure and the cosine function. Additionally, a TOPSIS technique based on cosine SMs has been developed for application in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) situations. An example of selecting a solid waste recycling technique is offered to demonstrate how effective the MCGDM approach to waste management can be.

AB This paper studied the effect of acupoint massage combined with predictive nursing based on image processing on fiberoptic bronchoscopy patients. In order to achieve this goal, this paper constructs an image recognition and processing system, which uses deep convolutional neural network to learn more robust advanced image features from original image data, so as to improve the performance and effect of digital image processing and computer vision. With this system, health care workers will be able to more efficiently judge medical images and identify appropriate treatments. In the experiment, patients in the control group took routine nursing measures, and patients in the experimental group used nano-antibacterial materials for acupoint massage, combined with predictive nursing methods. Research shows that, compared with conventional surgery, the nursing method in this paper pays more attention to the patient's own psychological state, which can help the patient cope with the treatment calmly, establish the correct bronchoscopy treatment concept, and teach the patient to correctly cooperate with the doctor during the operation to ensure the smooth operation process. This nursing method can improve the optimal therapeutic effect of fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

AB Compared with other imaging examination techniques, MRI can obtain more information of lesions through multi-sequence scanning imaging, clearly understand the relationship between lesions and other surrounding tissues, and also, it can eliminate the interference of adipose tissue on the disease by inhibiting the lipid sequence. According to random drawing, they were divided into observation group A and observation group B, among which observation group A was examined by MRI, and observation group B was examined by multi-slice spiral CT. After 2 years of follow-up, the recurrence rate detected by MRI was 15.00%; the recurrence rate of MSCT was 17.50%, and there was no significant difference in recurrence detection rate (P > 0.05); the difference in survival time and KPS score between the two groups was small (P > 0.05). The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI were 85.71%, 93.94%, and 92.50%; MSCT were 83.33%, 94.12%, and 92.50%. The differences in the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the two methods were small (P > 0.05). Multi-slice spiral CT has higher accuracy in the diagnosis of colon cancer recurrence after capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin regimen, and it is similar to MRI in the diagnosis of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Multi-slice spiral CT is convenient and fast, which is well accepted by patients and can be used as an effective method for the evaluation of recurrence after chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer.

AB There have been many developments in recent years based on the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly for managing data pertaining to healthcare as it is now known as the Internet of Health Things (IoHT). As those healthcare data ensure improved accuracy, security with enhanced integrity, and better quality data, some these data must be provisioned to such smart healthcare, which is a time-consuming problem in this organization. To improve data provisioning, data must be more secure and privacy protected, as enabled by federated learning and privacy policies. If the data is private, it is possible to learn about it with the owner's consent. With recent advancements, data process flow related to IoHT is associated with various IoT devices as edge nodes. As there is a problem with a partial level of trained nodes, learning at the nodes is much more difficult as it requires a fully decentralized environment, improved and trained datasets, data provisioning, and security. In this paper, a Hy-FL-based Blockchain approach is suggested because it can manage trust and trained data based on federated learning with better authentication thanks to blockchain technology. This proposed approach enables the encryption of trained data on federated nodes and aggregated data. In the analysis, IoHT-based data manageability is handled safely in terms of energy use, data accuracy, predicated value, etc.

AB The active distribution network (ADN) integrated optimization is the optimization of the system using three optimization techniques: reconfiguration, reactive power optimization and optimal configuration of distributed generation. This study establishes an optimization model of the renewable energy ADN and proposes a novel multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm to optimize the model. This study integrates three techniques of network reconfiguration, reactive power optimization and optimal configuration of distributed power sources to establish a comprehensive optimization model of ADN, which aims to reduce ADN energy losses, improve active distribution network power quality and economic efficiency. The contributions are as follows: (1) a multi-objective bald eagle search algorithm is proposed to deal with the complex nonlinear ADN integrated optimization problem, and its superiority is verified; (2) an ADN integrated optimization model is established; and (3) multiple scenarios are established in the IEEE33 node system for comparison and validation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can effectively improve the ADN operation with power loss, node voltage deviation and system cost reduced by 86.34%, 83.12% and 30.27%. The proposed algorism improves the power quality of ADN and promotes economic production and sustainable energy development.

ID CONVEX RELAXATION; COMPLETION; NOISE
AB In a recommender systems (RSs) dataset, observed ratings are subject to unequal amounts of noise. Some users might be consistently more conscientious in choosing the ratings they provide for the content they consume. Some items may be very divisive and elicit highly noisy reviews. In this article, we perform a nuclear-norm-based matrix factorization method which relies on side information in the form of an estimate of the uncertainty of each rating. A rating with a higher uncertainty is considered more likely to be erroneous or subject to large amounts of noise, and therefore more likely to mislead the model. Our uncertainty estimate is used as a weighting factor in the loss we optimize. To maintain the favorable scaling and theoretical guarantees coming with nuclear norm regularization even in this weighted context, we introduce an adjusted version of the trace norm regularizer which takes the weights into account. This regularization strategy is inspired from the weighted trace norm which was introduced to tackle nonuniform sampling regimes in matrix completion. Our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real life datasets in terms of various performance measures, confirming that we have successfully used the auxiliary information extracted.

AB Generally, the similarity between objects is often measured by symmetric operators, such as Cosine, Dice, and Jaccard similarity. However, the ratio model originally proposed by Tversky pointed out that the similarity using the feature matching method tends to be asymmetric. Furthermore, in many practical situations, the existing similarity measures using the feature matching method have some limitations: the calculation formulas are symmetrical, it is not intuitive based on binary features, and it is not easy to calculate based on fuzzy sets. To overcome such limitations, some other asymmetries have proposed to directly combine Tversky's ratio model with the classical symmetric similarity metric, which in turn leads to the inability to identify different features between the compared objects and affects their similarity accuracy. Therefore, aiming to avoid these, this paper will focus on extending Tversky's ratio model to a series of 3-parameter asymmetric similarity metrics (3p-ASM), using three conditional parameters to describe both common and different features. First, the set-based 3p-ASM is achieved due to the general and fuzzy set-theoretic operations, when estimating features in {0, 1} and [0, 1], respectively. Then, considering that the estimated values of features can also be expressed as vectors, it will be extended to the vector based 3p-ASM. Finally, a vector form of 3p-ASM is compared with existing classical methods and a comparative analysis is performed to demonstrate its effectiveness and validity. It is then applied to the KNN model in order to select the most similar items.

AB Quaternion neural networks (QNNs) form a class of neural networks constructed with quaternion numbers. They are suitable for processing 3-D features with fewer trainable free parameters than real-valued neural networks (RVNNs). This article proposes symbol detection in wireless polarization-shift-keying (PolSK) communications by employing QNNs. We demonstrate that quaternion plays a crucial role in the symbol detection of PolSK signals. Existing artificial-intelligence communication studies mainly focus on RVNN-based symbol detection in digital modulations having constellations in complex plane. However, in PolSK, information symbols are represented as the state of polarization, which can be mapped on the Poincare sphere and thus its symbols have a 3-D data structure. Quaternion algebra offers a unified representation to process 3-D data with rotational invariance and, therefore, it keeps the internal relationship among three components of a PolSK symbol. Hence, we can expect that QNNs learn the distribution of received symbols on the Poincare sphere with higher consistency to detect the transmitted symbols more efficiently than RVNNs. We compare PolSK symbol detection accuracy of two types of QNNs, RVNN, existing methods such as least-square and minimum-mean-square-error channel estimations, as well as detection knowing perfect channel state information (CSI). Simulation results including symbol error rate show that the proposed QNNs outperform the existing estimation methods and that they reach better results with two to three times fewer free parameters than the RVNN. We find that QNN processing will bring practical use of PolSK communications.

ID MODEL
AB Concept drift in online streaming data is a common issue due to dynamic smart systems, which results in system failure or performance degradation. Though there are several traditional approaches for handling the streaming data, they failed to handle the concept drift imposing the need for developing an adaptable approach to managing the dynamic IoT streaming data. Therefore, in this research, a new method is proposed for handling the concept drift issues in online data streaming. This research develops the dynamic streaming data analytic framework based on the optimized Deep CNN and optimized adaptive and sliding window (OASW) approach that effectively addresses both memory and time constraints. An optimized Deep CNN classifier is employed as a base classifier for offline learning, which is developed through hybridizing the proposed Desale's aggressive hunt optimization (AHO) algorithm with a Deep CNN classifier for tuning the optimal parameters of the classifier. An optimized adaptive and sliding window is utilized in this research to adapt the pattern changes in the data streams, which effectively handles the concept drift. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed methods outperform the conventional methods considered for the analysis in terms of specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F1 score, and the precision score of 96.65%, 97.77%, 98.63%, 98.1487%, and 98.4469%, respectively.

TI Dimension-divided feature smoothing for graph neural network

   classification; Topology modification
AB Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) learn the node representation of multi-hops through stacking layers. However, deep GNNs often suffer from over-smoothing, which drives people to the road of model simplification. With the deepening of research, it is found that the representation of nodes is more related to feature smoothing. More and more simplified models show that the nonparametric feature smoothing scheme can not only reduce computational complexity but also improve performance. Because the features of nodes in GNNs propagate along the edges, the denoising of graph data mainly focuses on the modification of graph topology. Based on this, we propose a feature smoothing scheme on the topology modification graph named Topology-modified Feature Smoothing(TMFS). Experiments show that the smoothed features calculated by TMFS can improve the performance of GNNs. Graph data usually have high-dimension features. Some feature dimensions contribute more to node classification, while others may only be the personality features of specific nodes. However, the existing propagation schemes cause all dimensional features to propagate along the edge at the same time. Such schemes as dropedge and addedge cannot change this situation. This feature propagation method is very mechanized. To solve this problem, we divide the dimension of features according to commonality nature, and modify the graph topology respectively, to realize the Dimension-divided Feature Smoothing(DDFS) of personalized propagation. Our experiments show that the deep features obtained by DDFS can not only improve the performance of GNNs but also be more stable. Our feature smoothing scheme can be seen as a plug-and-play module. On the Cora dataset, the smoothed features of our DDFS have improved the accuracy of MLP by 27.88% and other GNNs by 2.29% at most.

AB Over the past few decades, cognitive science has identified several forms of reasoning that make essential use of conceptual knowledge. Despite significant theoretical and empirical progress, there is still no unified framework for understanding how concepts are used in reasoning. This paper argues that the theory of conceptual spaces is capable of filling this gap. Our strategy is to demonstrate how various inference mechanisms which clearly rely on conceptual information-including similarity, typicality, and diagnosticity-based reasoning-can be modeled using principles derived from conceptual spaces. Our first topic analyzes the role of expectations in inductive reasoning and their relation to the structure of our concepts. We examine the relationship between using generic expressions in natural language and common-sense reasoning as a second topic. We propose that the strength of a generic can be described by distances between properties and prototypes in conceptual spaces. Our third topic is category-based induction. We demonstrate that the theory of conceptual spaces can serve as a comprehensive model for this type of reasoning. The final topic is analogy. We review some proposals in this area, present a taxonomy of analogical relations, and show how to model them in terms of distances in conceptual spaces. We also briefly discuss the implications of the model for reasoning with concepts in artificial systems.

ID DECISION IMPLICATION
AB Formal concept analysis is an effective tool for data analysis and visualization by means of concept lattice. Many concept lattice models have been studied in various settings. Variable threshold concept lattice is a fuzzy concept lattice constructed from fuzzy data. However, variable threshold concept lattice is not robust to noise because it employs a single threshold, instead of an interval to derive formal concepts. Thus, the paper introduces the tolerance threshold to variable threshold concept lattice, and forms the ROBust variable threshold fuzzy Concept Lattice (RobCL). By analyzing the properties of RobCL, we show that RobCL has some incremental characteristics and is able to model the incremental cognitive process, which makes RobCL distinctive from other concept lattice models. A comparative study shows that variable threshold concept lattice is just a special case of RobCL; in other words, when two thresholds coincide with each other, RobCL degenerates to variable threshold concept lattice and the incremental characteristics vanish. In addition, the proposed model is also applied to medical diagnosis and shows its superiority over the previous model.

AB The widely employed tiny neural networks (TNNs) in mobile devices are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, more advanced research on the robustness of TNNs is highly in demand. This work focuses on improving the robustness of TNNs without sacrificing the model's accuracy. To find the optimal trade-off networks in terms of the adversarial accuracy, clean accuracy, and model size, we present TAM-NAS, a tiny adversarial multi-objective one-shot network architecture search method. First, we build a novel search space comprised of new tiny blocks and channels to establish a balance between the model size and adversarial performance. Then, we demonstrate how the supernet facilitates the acquisition of the optimal subnet under white-box adversarial attacks, provided that the supernet significantly impacts the subnet's performance. Concretely, we investigate a new adversarial training paradigm by evaluating the adversarial transferability, the width of the supernet, and the distinction between training subnets from scratch and fine-tuning. Finally, we undertake statistical analysis for the layer-wise combination of specific blocks and channels on the first non-dominated front, which can be utilized as a design guideline for the design of TNNs.

AB Designing and developing sustainable circular supply chain networks for electric vehicle (EV) lithium-ion battery recycling and production requires complex environmental sustainability and economic viability assessment. EVs use a lot of data for battery management and delivering optimum performance, and the Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role in managing this data. This study develops a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model for designing a sustainable circular supply chain to manage the manufacturing, remanufacturing, and distribution of EV lithium-ion batteries under uncertainty using the IoT and big data. The proposed model simultaneously minimizes total costs and CO2 emissions and uses IoT to improve network performance and create a traceable and secure environment. A fuzzy multi-objective method solves the bi-objective optimization model under uncertainty, and a simulation algorithm examines the effectiveness of the proposed model through simulated problems.

AB With the emergence of online car-hailing platforms, more travel options and convenience have been provided to people. However, the 'tidal phenomenon' of travel often leads to an imbalance between the supply and demand of vehicles, especially during peak hours. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm for fleet dispatch using effective Credit Assignment Deep Policy Gradient (CADPG). The CADPG model first learns an action for each agent (i.e., vehicle) with the local states of the vehicle through the policy network. Secondly, a set of parameters for credit assignment to compute the total Q value is learned by a hyper-network with the input of the global state. Finally, we feed the joint action vectors and the hyperparameters produced by the hyper-network into the critic network to obtain the total Q value of the joint actions. Experimental results conducted on real datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the compared algorithms.

AB Crime is a significant issue in society, with the causes of crime needing more attention and action from social, governmental, and judicial entities. Investigating crimes can be challenging due to uncertainties and unreliable evidence. Crime linkage helps investigators identify and solve crimes committed by the same individuals or groups. Fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets have been helpful in decision-making problems related to crime linkage due to the uncertainty involved. Similarity measures are essential in decision-making problems, but the existing measures must be revised when dealing with three or more intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The proposed resemblance measure based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets can find similarities between more than two sets and be used in the crime linkage. The proposed measure's superiority is demonstrated through examples and applied to crime linkage through case studies. A methodology for the psychological profiling of offenders is also presented through case studies. These proposed methods can help law enforcement solve decision-making problems related to crime linkage and psychological profiling.

AB This paper presents twin-hyperspheres of resisting noise for binary classification to imbalanced data with noise. First, employing the decision of evaluating the contributions created by points for the training of the hyperspheres, then the label density estimator is introduced into the fuzzy membership to quantize the provided contributions, and finally, unknown points can be assigned into corresponding classes. Utilizing the decision, the interference created by the noise hidden in the data is suppressed. Experiment results show that when noise ratio reaches 90%, classification accuracies of the model are 0.802, 0.611 on the synthetic datasets and UCI datasets containing Gaussian noise, respectively. Classification results of the model outperform these of the competitors, and these boundaries learned by the model to separate noise from majority classes and minority classes are superior to these learned by the competitors. Moreover, efforts gained by the proposed density fuzzy are effectiveness in noise resistance; meanwhile, the density fuzzy does not rely on specific classifiers or specific scenarios.

AB The probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy set (PDHFS), as an extension of generalization of the dual hesitant fuzzy set, contains not only the hesitation values of membership degree (MD) and non-membership degree (NMD), but also considers the probabilities corresponding to MDs and NMDs, which are the degree of support and confidence of the decision makers in the evaluation value given by them. Distance measures, entropy measures, and cross-entropy measures are important tools in multi-attribute decision-making. In the PDHFS environment, distance and entropy measures are improved, and cross-entropy is proposed, and multi-attribute decision-making methods based on distance and entropy and cross-entropy are given. First, in order to effectively compare the distances between different PDHFSs, we improve the existing distance measures. Second, we review the existing formulations of probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy entropy and find that they could not effectively distinguish the uncertainty of different PDHFSs due to ignoring the uncertainty caused by the differences between different MDs and between different NMDs, so we improve the existing entropy measure. Additionally, the formulas and properties of the cross-entropy of PDHFS and the axiomatic definition of the generalized cross-entropy of PDHFS are given. Finally, depending on the distance and entropy and cross-entropy built, we propose a new multi-attribute decision method to solve the multi-attribute decision problem with completely unknown attribute weights. We apply the proposed method to the protective decision-making for the release of radioactive substances, and the feasibility of the method is verified by comparative analysis.

AB All signals obtained as instrumental response of analytical apparatus are affected by noise, as in Raman spectroscopy. Whereas Raman scattering is an inherently weak process, the noise background may lead to misinterpretations. Although surface amplification of the Raman signal using metallic nanoparticles has been a strategy employed to partially solve the signal-to-noise problem, the preprocessing of Raman spectral data through the use of mathematical filters has become an integral part of Raman spectroscopy analysis. In this paper, a Tikhonov modified method to remove random noise in experimental data is presented. In order to refine and improve the Tikhonov method as a filter, the proposed method includes Euclidean norm of the fractional-order derivative of the solution as an additional criterion in Tikhonov function. In the strategy used here, the solution depends on the regularization parameter, & lambda;$$ \lambda $$, and on the fractional derivative order, & alpha;$$ \alpha $$. As will be demonstrated, with the algorithm presented here, it is possible to obtain a noise-free spectrum without affecting the fidelity of the molecular signal. In this alternative, the fractional derivative works as a fine control parameter for the usual Tikhonov method. The proposed method was applied to simulated data and to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra of crystal violet dye in Ag nanoparticles colloidal dispersion.

AB Anticipatory thinking (AT) and design have many commonalities. We identify three challenges for all computational AT systems: representation, generation, and evaluation. We discuss how existing artificial intelligence techniques provide some methods for addressing these, but also fall significantly short. Next, we articulate where AT concepts appear in three computational design paradigms: configuration design, design for resilience, and conceptual design. We close by identifying two promising future directions at the intersection of AT and design: modeling other humans and new interfaces to support human decision-makers.

AB The limitation of the small-scale expression samples generally causes the performance degradation for facial expression recognition-based methods. Also, the correlation between different expression is always ignored when performing feature extraction process. Given above, we propose a novel approach that develops multi-class differentiation feature representation guided joint dictionary learning for FER. The proposed approach mainly includes two steps: firstly, we construct multi-class differentiation feature dictionaries corresponding to different expressions of training samples, aiming to enlarge inter-expression distance to mitigate the problem of nonlinear distribution in training samples. Secondly, we joint learn the multiple feature dictionaries by optimizing the resolutions of each feature dictionary, aiming to establish the strong relationship and enhance the representation ability among multiple feature dictionaries. To sum up, the proposed approach has more discriminative ability from the representation perspective. Comprehensive experiments carried out using three public datasets, including JAFFE, CK+ , and KDEF datasets, demonstrate that the proposed approach has strong performance for small-scale samples compared to several state-of-the-art methods.

AB Urgent care clinics and emergency departments around the world periodically suffer from extended wait times beyond patient expectations due to surges in patient flows. The delays arising from inadequate staffing levels during these periods have been linked with adverse clinical outcomes. Previous research into forecasting patient flows has mostly used statistical techniques. These studies have also predominately focussed on short-term forecasts, which have limited practicality for the resourcing of medical personnel. This study joins an emerging body of work which seeks to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to generate accurate forecasts of patient presentations. Our research uses datasets covering 10 years from two large urgent care clinics to develop long-term patient flow forecasts up to one quarter ahead using a range of state-of-the-art algorithms. A distinctive feature of this study is the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapely and LIME that enable an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of the models, which would otherwise be uninterpretable. These analysis tools enabled us to explore the ability of the models to adapt to the volatility in patient demand during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and to identify the most impactful variables, resulting in valuable insights into their performance. The results showed that a novel combination of advanced univariate models like Prophet as well as gradient boosting, into an ensemble, delivered the most accurate and consistent solutions on average. This approach generated improvements in the range of 16%-30% over the existing in-house methods for estimating the daily patient flows 90 days ahead.

AB The optimal parameter values in a feed-forward neural network model play an important role in determining the efficiency and significance of the trained model. In this paper, we propose an upgraded artificial electric field algorithm (AEFA) for training feed-forward neural network models. This paper also throws some light on the effective use of multi-agent meta-heuristic techniques for the training of neural network models and their future prospects. Seven real-life data sets are used to train neural network models, the results of these trained models show that the proposed scheme performs well in comparison to other training algorithms in terms of high classification accuracy and minimum test error values including gradient-based algorithms and differential evolution variants. Some fundamental modifications in AEFA are also proposed to make it more suitable for training neural networks. All the experimental findings show that the search capabilities and convergence rate of the proposed scheme are better than those of other capable schemes, including gradient-based schemes.

AB Image watermarking prevents copyright infringements by attaching visible/invisible watermark images as authentication identities in the owner's documents. The article made analysis on the advantages of different transformations for choosing better combinations to make the watermark embedding process and observed that watermarking techniques incorporating discrete cosine transform (DCT) provide better resistance towards JPEG based potential attacks, discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has strong energy compaction with geometrical invariance properties to resist geometric attacks while singular value decomposition (SVD) provides stability, proportion invariance and rotation invariance properties and it provides strong resistance against noise based attacks. Considering these advantages of different transformations, the article presents a new non-blind watermarking algorithm by utilizing advantages of DFT, DCT and SVD transforms while attaching secret contents in cover images. The algorithm starts by applying DFT followed by onion peel decomposition (OPD) for decomposing Fourier domain carrier image to four frequency sub images. The scheme then applies DCT on the frequency bands and orders them in zigzag fashion to form four individual frequency arrays. In the final step of embedding process, it embeds four copies of watermark singular value contents in DFT domain with the carrier image singular value contents to produce the watermarked image. The experimental results based on subjective and objective metrics on various test images from standard image databases with different test conditions demarcate the stability of new algorithm in producing high quality watermarked images with fewer distortions even when the watermarked images are extremely distorted by potential attacks.

AB In this article, the problem of integral sliding mode control (ISMC) for a class of nonlinear systems with stochastic characteristics under cyber-attack is investigated. The control system and the cyber-attack are modeled as an Ito-type stochastic differential equation. The stochastic nonlinear systems are approached by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. A dynamic ISMC scheme is applied and the states and control input are analyzed within a universal dynamic model. It is demonstrated that trajectory of the system can be confined to the integral sliding surface within finite time, and the stability of closed-loop system under cyber-attack will be guaranteed by using a set of linear matrix inequalities. Following a standard procedure of universal fuzzy ISMC, it is shown that all signals in the closed-loop system will be guaranteed bounded, and the states are asymptotic stochastic stable if some conditions are met. An inverted pendulum is applied to show the effectiveness of our control scheme.

ID MODEL
AB Learning subtle and discriminative regions plays an important role in fine-grained image recognition, and attention mechanisms have shown great potential in such tasks. Recent research mainly focuses on employing the attention mechanism to locate key discriminative regions and learn salient features, whilst ignoring imperceptible complementary features and the causal relationship between prediction results and attention. To address the above issues, we propose an Attention Interaction and Counterfactual Attention Network (AICA-Net). Specifically, we propose an Attention Interaction Fusion Module (AIFM) to model the negative correlation between the attention map channels to locate the complementary features, and fuse the complementary features and key discriminative features to generate richer fine-grained features. Simultaneously, an Enhanced Counterfactual Attention Module (ECAM) is proposed to generate a counterfactual attention map. By comparing the impact of the learned attention map and the counterfactual attention map on the final prediction results, quantifying the quality of attention drives the network to learn more effective attention. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, FGVC-Aircraft and Stanford Cars datasets have shown that our AICA-Net can get outstanding results. In particular, it achieves 90.83% and 95.87% accuracy on two open competitive benchmark datasets CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions.

AB To better characterize the health status and performing remaining useful life prediction, a composite health index is developed through the fusion of multi-channel signals. However, most of the existing literature limits the data fusion to be linear, which implies that the underlying degradation pattern must follow a linear form. This strong prerequisite of these approaches undermines the effectiveness of existing techniques for capturing the potential nonlinear nature of degradation process. In order to overcome this limitation as well as to improve the predictability, this paper proposes a nonlinear health index construction method achieving by an unsupervised neural network. Specifically, a neural network structure is introduced to approximate the highly nonlinear relationship between signals and health status. Furthermore, we consider the remaining useful life prediction as a binary classification problem, and then propose a maximal classification margin constraint, which is integrated with the monotonicity and minimal variability at the failure time to formulate the novel loss function. To estimate the model parameter, we developed a customized adaptive moment estimation algorithm (Adam). The comprehensive case study is performed based on the benchmark C-MAPSS dataset. As reported in the experiment, the constructed health index can better characterize the underlying degradation process.

AB Probabilistic dual hesitation fuzzy set (PDHFS) is a new tool used to enhance fuzzy and imprecise information in a changing and complex decision-making environment. Compared with the existing fuzzy sets, PDHFS is more suitable for identifying uncertain evaluation data in complex and realistic decision-making situations. The extended power average (EPA) and generalized power average (GPA) operators provide more information for the information aggregation process, reflecting the mutual support among all aggregation values. To solve the evaluation problems related to decision analysis involving extremely complex information, especially in the case of extreme data in the consideration of decision problems. In this paper, the generalized extended power average (GEPA) operator is proposed in the PDHF environment. This research has the following four important contributions. First, we propose a probability splitting algorithm of normalizing PDHFE, and give some new basic operations, score function, distance measures and aggregation operators. Second, to better integrate the advantages of EPA and GPA operators, we developed the GEPA operator, weighted form (WGEPA) and ordered form (GEPOWA). Meanwhile, by adjusting the parameter in three types of operators, we can find that many existing operators are special forms of the three types of operators. Third, extended the three types of operators to the PDHF environment, the PDHFGEPA, PDHFWGEPA, PDHFGEPOWA operators and some special aggregation operators are obtained, and studied their valuable properties in detail. Finally, taking the application of PDHFWGEPA operator as an example, a new multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) technique is developed and used to solve the problem of online teaching platform supplier selection (OTPSS). Through parameter sensitivity analysis, the flexibility and stability of MAGDM technique are illustrated, and compared with some existing decision-making methods, the effectiveness of MAGDM method is proved. In addition, this technique also provides some theoretical references for dealing with other complex MAGDM problems, and provides a new operator for the extension of GEPA operator in other fuzzy environments. The biggest advantage of several operators is that they can pay full attention to the special role of extreme data in decision-making.

DE Underwater image enhancement; Deep learning; Revised imaging network;
   Adaptive channel balance; Visual perception correction
AB Considering the limitation of a single physics-based or deep learning-based method, this paper proposes an effective Dual-model methodology for underwater image enhancement. The Dual-model mainly consists of two branches: the Revised Imaging Network-model (RIN-model) and the Visual Perception Correction-model (VPC-model). Specifically, instead of directly learning an image-to-image mapping strategy, the RIN-model constructs a compact network to estimate the ambient-light and direct-transmission parameters, which are used to reconstruct the preliminary enhanced image based on the revised underwater image formation model. Based on the pre-trained RIN-model, the ambient-light and direct-transmission parameters estimated using only a single input image may be biased, especially for these severely degraded underwater images. To further correct the visual perception of the preliminary enhanced image, the VPC-model incorporates the adaptive-stretching histogram and relative-stretching histogram for contrast enhancement and color restoration, respectively. We also present an adaptive color balance compensation method to estimate the maximum attenuation channel and equalize the information distribution of the three channels in the preliminary enhanced image, which acts as a transition procedure to prevent color distortion or detail destruction caused by excessive stretching in the VPC-model. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations have revealed that our Dual-model outperforms seven state-of-the-art underwater image enhancement methods, including the MLLE, Haze-Lines, HLRP, ACDC, UWCNN, FUnIE-GAN, and Water-Net. In the UIEB and EUVP datasets, our methodology achieves relatively better performance than other methods on both full-reference and no-reference evaluation metrics. We also validate that the proposed methodology facilitates the advanced image applications of local feature matching and edge detection.

AB In recent times, the growth of human computer interaction and Artificial Intelligence attains more interest especially in facial expression detection. Though the field has attained tremendous progress, still many issues are pertained as the facial expressions are complex. Therefore the present study aims to increase the efficiency in classifying the emotions of humans from the images of FER-2013 dataset and strives to attain optimal accuracy. Most of the studies have averted multi-modal parameters like a video for emotion detection. Moreover, existing studies lacked a detection rate due to ineffective feature extraction that negatively impacted the classification rate. For avoiding such pitfalls, this study proposes suitable data mining-based algorithms with the main intention to attain high accuracy. The present study proposes Deep Location Attention Forest method for emotion detection with higher accuracy. To accomplish this, DLFAT (Deep Location Feed Attention Transformers) is used for feature extraction from various sub-space representation at different position of the image. CK-PCA (Canonical Kernel-Principal Component Analysis) is performed feature fusion to improve the performance of the classifier. MRF (Modified Random Forest) is proposed to perform classification and predicts the emotions based on the facial expressions. The main intention of RF relies on learning all the data subset weights that alleviate loss amongst the predicted value for accomplishing better input classification to the related label. The proposed system is validated by the performance metrics in which the outcome is found to be 0.96197 as accuracy, 0.96 as F1-Score, 0.97 as recall and 0.96 as precision and the outcomes reveal the efficacy of the system in emotion detection.

One of the overriding concerns of managers is the efficient exploitation of workers' learning to increase output and decrease downtime. The learning effect symbolizes the improvement of workers' ability and performance through the repetition of similar jobs. On the other hand, it is a critical requirement for decision-makers to have effective management of the transportation phase to achieve an optimal production plan. This paper considers a flow shop sequence-dependent group scheduling problem (FSDGS) with a learning effect to minimize two contradictory objective functions, namely makespan and energy consumption.A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to find optimal jobs, group schedules, and appropriate production and transportation speeds to enhance the overall performance of the system. Due to the complexity of the planning process, we propose lower bounds and an efficient resolution method based on multi-objective simulated annealing metaheuristic (MOSA), enhanced by a local search procedure to tackle this problem. The proposed method is evaluated through several experiments based on a real case study, using different learning rates and setup time ratio levels. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in improving the performance of production systems by reducing processing time and energy consumption. These findings have significant implications for the design and optimization of production systems in manufacturing industries.

AB We propose using operator learning to approximate the dynamical response of non-autonomous systems, such as nonlinear control systems. Unlike classical function learning, operator learning maps between two function spaces, does not require discretization of the output function, and provides flexibility in data preparation and solution prediction. Particularly, we apply and redesign the Deep Operator Neural Network (DeepONet) to recursively learn the solution trajectories of the dynamical systems. Our approach involves constructing and training a DeepONet that approximates the system's local solution operator. We then develop a numerical scheme that recursively simulates the system's long/medium-term dynamic response for given inputs and initial conditions, using the trained DeepONet. We accompany the proposed scheme with an estimate for the error bound of the associated cumulative error. Moreover, we propose a data-driven Runge-Kutta (RK) explicit scheme that leverages the DeepONet's forward pass and automatic differentiation to better approximate the system's response when the numerical scheme's step size is small. Numerical experiments on the predator- prey, pendulum, and cart pole systems demonstrate that our proposed DeepONet framework effectively learns to approximate the dynamical response of non-autonomous systems with time-dependent inputs.

AB The increasing amount of real-time data collected from sensors in industrial environments has accelerated the application of machine learning in decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool to find optimal policies for achieving a given goal. However, RL's typical application is risky and insufficient in environments where actions can have irreversible consequences and require interpretability and fairness. While new trends in RL may provide guidance based on expert knowledge, they do not often consider uncertainty or include prior knowledge in the learning process. We propose a causal reinforcement learning alternative based on Bayesian networks (RLBNs) to address this challenge. The RLBN simultaneously models a policy and takes advantage of the joint distribution of the state and action space, reducing uncertainty in unknown situations. We propose a training algorithm for the network's parameters and structure based on the reward function and likelihood of the effects and measurements taken. Our experiment with the CartPole benchmark and industrial fouling using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) demonstrates that RLBNs are interpretable, secure, flexible, and more robust than their competitors. Our contributions include a novel method that incorporates expert knowledge into the decision-making engine. It uses Bayesian networks with a predefined structure as a causal graph and a hybrid learning strategy that considers both likelihood and reward. This would avoid losing the virtues of the Bayesian network.

   learning
AB Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is an important research area in image computing, video processing, multimedia understanding, and other visual computing tasks. GZSL normally uses transferable semantic features to represent the visual features to predict unseen classes without training the unseen samples. The state-of-the-art zero-shot learning methods combine Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Contrastive Learning (CL) together to deeply transfer semantic features to visual features. However, the combined GAN module and CL module inevitably encounter the "semantic-visual inconsistent problem" in both the feature-generating process and the contrastive learning process. To handle the above problems, we propose the generation-based contrastive model with semantic alignment for generalized zero-shot learning. The proposed network is based on existing ZSL models combining GAN and CL, but with two additional alignment modules that are Feedback Alignment Module (FAM) and Negative sample Alignment Module (NAM). FAM applies an MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) to align the synthesized visual feature back to its semantic feature for keeping the semantic-visual consistency in the generator. NAM provides a new contrastive learning mechanism to align the negative pairs for keeping semanticvisual consistency during contrastive learning. Experimental results on massive real-world datasets show the proposed method achieves the new state-of-the-art in the field of generalized zero-shot learning. The source code of the proposed method is available athttps://github.com/yangjingqi99/GCSA.

AB As the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era has begun, a quantum neural network (QNN) is definitely a promising solution to many problems that classical neural networks cannot solve. In addition, a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) is now receiving a lot of attention because it can process high dimensional inputs comparing to QNN. However, due to the nature of quantum computing, it is difficult to scale up the QCNN to extract a sufficient number of features due to barren plateaus. This is especially challenging in classification operations with high-dimensional data input. However, due to the nature of quantum computing, it is difficult to scale up the QCNN to extract a sufficient number of features due to barren plateaus. This is especially challenging in classification operations with high dimensional data input. Motivated by this, a novel stereoscopic 3D scalable QCNN (sQCNN-3D) is proposed for point cloud data processing in classification applications. Furthermore, reverse fidelity training (RF-Train) is additionally considered on top of sQCNN-3D for diversifying features with a limited number of qubits using the fidelity of quantum computing. Our data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that the proposed algorithm achieves desired performance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   filling strategy
AB Single-image dehazing aims to recover blurred image details and improve image quality, which is a challenging ill-posed problem due to severe information degradation. In the image dehazing task, extracting local features from adjacent regions is particularly important. However, Transformer-based methods lack relative awareness of patch-level features. Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of self-attention to textcolorreddata distribution, the model suffers severe performance degradation when migrating from synthetic domain to real domain. To alleviate the above problems, we propose visual transformer with stable prior and patch-level attention (VSPPA) for image dehazing. Firstly, we propose a region-aware patch-level attention module to obtain the positional correlation between local patches and contexts, which can enhance the concentration of local patch-related features. Next, due to the instability problem caused by distribution shifts, we introduce dataset-independent prior to guide the transformer model, thereby preventing feature drift thus to improve the robustness of the model. Finally, domain-drift leads to insufficient dehazing when the model trained on synthetic data while migrates to the real environment, we come up with a introduce a patch filling strategy (PFS) for fuzzy data to narrow the domain gap and realize the generalization in real scenes. Extensive experiments show that the model achieves State-of-the Art on the SOTS synthetic dataset and effective generalization to real-world scenarios.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID INFORMATION
AB Semantic segmentation is a dense pixel prediction task, and its accuracy depends on the extraction of long-range contextual knowledge and refinement of segmentation boundaries. Most segmentation methods are based on feature extraction using a convolutional neural network, and layer-by-layer sampling and fusion are applied to solve inherent problems such as chaotic boundaries and scattered objects. Owing to the limited receptive field and loss of details during downsampling, the segmentation results may be unsatisfactory. To address existing shortcomings, we propose a dual-stage refinement network (DRNet) for semantic segmentation. In the first stage, we adopt an efficient spatiotemporal representation learning framework called UniFormer. We also use a novel boundary extractor and initial segmentation map generator to obtain rough segmentation results. In the second stage, we use the rough segmentation map and extracted boundary information in a graph reasoning module that restores the class boundary features while completing global modeling and local information inference. Benefiting from the acquisition of long-range dependencies between image pixels, contextual information promotes the distinction of pixel categories. In addition, edge information can increase the interclass distinguishability and refine the segmentation boundaries. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRNet outperforms state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods. The codes and results are available at: https://github.com/EnquanYang2022/DRNet.

AB In response to the complexity of power repair in mountainous areas and the limitations of traditional vehicles due to terrain constraints, this study focuses on the three-dimensional trajectory planning problem of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) in mountainous environments. Our goal is to provide effective solutions for the trajectory planning problem of UAVs in mountainous environments. Firstly, a UAV trajectory planning model is established, incorporating optimization objectives such as energy consumption, trajectory cost, obstacle avoidance cost, smoothing cost, and stability cost. The trajectory planning problem is transformed into an objective function optimization task with multiple performance constraints. To overcome the inefficiency and infeasibility of traditional algorithms in solving complex three-dimensional flight environments, we propose improvements to the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm through three strategies: incorporating mutation crossover factor optimization strategy, an adaptive guidance mechanism, and an elite disturbance mechanism based on population classification. The Multi-Strategy Improved Differential Evolution (MSIDE) algorithm is introduced, and its time and space complexity are analyzed. Finally, the proposed method is compared with various algorithms through benchmark functions tests, Friedman test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, simulation experiments in three-dimensional environments, and parameter sensitivity analysis experiments. The simulation results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art algorithms, the MSIDE algorithm improves the objective function value by 11.34% on average in regular terrain and 5.04% on average in complex terrain environments. The results demonstrate the convergence, multi-objective search capability, and global search ability of MSIDE, validating its effectiveness in solving the trajectory planning problem of UAVs in complex mountainous environments.

AB With the ability to extract spatiotemporal features, 3D convolutional networks have become the mainstream method for Video Saliency Prediction (VSP). However, these methods cannot make full use of hierarchical spatio-temporal features and also lack focus on past salient features, which hinders further improvements in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a 3D convolutional Network based on Hierarchical Fusion and Temporal Re-currence (HFTR-Net) for VSP. Specifically, we propose a Bi-directional Temporal-Spatial Feature Pyramid (BiTSFP), which adds the flow of shallow location information based on the previous flow of deep semantic infor-mation. Then, different from simple addition and concatenation, we design a Hierarchical Adaptive Fusion (HAF) mechanism that can adaptively learn the fusion weights of adjacent features to integrate them appropriately. Moreover, to utilize previous salient information, a Recall 3D convGRU (R3D GRU) module is integrated into the 3D convolution-based method for the first time. It subtly combines the local feature extraction of the 3D back-bone with the long-term relationship modeling of the temporal recurrence mechanism. Experimental results on the three common datasets demonstrate that the HFTR-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cloud computing, edge computing, and Internet-of-Things these new Internet concepts have already irreversibly changed and influenced people's lives. The security of the three patterns must not be taken for granted, though. Similar to other emerging technologies, the cloud, edge and IoT are under constant attack. In the case of these paradigms, the potential breaches may paralyse transportation systems, business sectors or even turn out to be life-threatening. So far, there has not yet been a scientific meta analysis of the overlap of the attacks in the cloud, edge and IoT; one that would result in constructing a concise threat catalogue as well as seeking a more universal solution which could contribute to ensuring the security of the whole ecosystem. In order to fill this substantial gap, this systematic review gathers, analyses and extracts data from a substantial number of quality scientific literature papers pertaining to the security issues of the cloud, edge and IoT, and compares the attacks in each concept in order to find the areas of overlap. Another contribution of this paper is that it constructs a catalogue of the identified attacks. In addition to this, it also suggests a number of possible solutions and countermeasures which, when applied, may contribute to safer cloud, edge and IoT alike. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Archaeologists cannot observe face-to-face interactions in the past, yet methods derived from the analyses of social networks are often used to make inferences about patterns of past social interactions using material cultural remains as a proxy. We created the ArchMatNet agent-based model to explore the relationship between networks built from archaeological material and the past social networks that generated them. It was designed as an abstract model representing a wide variety of social systems and their dynamics: from hunter-gatherer groups to small-scale horticulturalists. The model is highly flexible, allowing agents to engage in a variety of activities (e.g., group hunting, visiting, trading, cultural transmission, migration, seasonal aggregations, etc.), and includes several parameters that can be adjusted to represent the social, demographic and historical dynamics of interest. This article examines how sensitive the model is to changes in these various parameters, primarily by relying on the one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach to sensitivity analysis. Our purpose is for this sensitivity analyses to serve as a guide for users of the model containing information on how the model works, the types of agents and variables included, how parameters interact with one another, the model outputs, and how to make informed choices on parameter values.

AB What do designers actually do while they are designing? How about their ideas and intentions toward a specific design activity? These issues are still urgently in need of resolution since designers play such a crucial role in the design process. However, existing research primarily concentrates on the explicit knowledge representation of designers' activities, but ignores tacit information that is underlying the motivation behind those activities. Fortunately, as a psychology-based inner cognitive representation of external reality, mental models take us a glimpse into explaining and driving designer activities. Based on the above, this paper proposed a novel framework with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Word2Vec integrated harmoniously to capture the designer' activities. Additionally, both the know-how and know-why knowledge were represented by eliciting knowledge structure and belief structure of mental models respectively. Based on the distribution values of these two structures, the using opportunities of designer's ideas are further explored to reveal their potential for being adopted, improved, explored, or discarded during the design process. Then the detailed design process is characterized by mental models to express the designers actions, ideas, and intentions for the artifact that they are designing. Finally, the experimental results performed a practical design case demonstrating that our proposed framework is applicable and helpful for designing.

AB In real-world application scenarios, multi-label learning (MLL) datasets often contain some irrelevant noisy labels, which degrades the performance of traditional multi-label learning models. In order to deal with this problem, partial multi-label learning (PML) is proposed, in which each instance is associated with a candidate label set, which includes multiple relevant ground-truth labels and some irrelevant noisy labels. The common strategy to deal with this problem is disambiguating the candidate label set, but the co-occurrence of noisy labels and ground-truth labels makes the disambiguation technique susceptible to error. In this paper, a novel disambiguation-free PML approach named PMLTT is proposed. Specifically, by adapting the tri-training framework, mutual cooperation and iteration between classifiers are used to correct noisy labels and improve the performance of the learning model. Moreover, the three-way decision is adapted to solve the conflict problem of the base classifier and obtain more useful training samples. In addition, the precise supervisory information of the noncandidate labels is exploited to make the predictions of the base classifier more accurate. Finally, experimental results on both synthetic and real-world PML datasets show that the proposed PML-TT approach can effectively reduce the negative influence of noisy labels and learn a robust model.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Current hardware limitations make it impossible to train convolutional neural networks on gigapixel image inputs directly. Recent developments in weakly supervised learning, such as attention-gated multiple instance learning, have shown promising results, but often use multi-stage or patch-wise training strategies risking suboptimal feature extraction, which can negatively impact performance. In this paper, we propose to train a ResNet-34 encoder with an attention-gated classification head in an end-to-end fashion, which we call StreamingCLAM, using a streaming implementation of convolutional layers. This allows us to train end-to-end on 4-gigapixel microscopic images using only slide-level labels.We achieve a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9757 for metastatic breast cancer detection (CAMELYON16), close to fully supervised approaches using pixel-level annotations. Our model can also detect MYC-gene translocation in histologic slides of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, achieving a mean area under the ROC curve of 0.8259. Furthermore, we show that our model offers a degree of interpretability through the attention mechanism.

AB Image dehazing aims to restore the missing high-quality content from its original hazy observation. Most of the existing learning-based methods achieve promising achievements by designing various networks. However, these approaches cannot generalize well on real-world scenes, since they fail to exploit natural haze priors. Towards this end, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Progressive Dehazing Network (Semi-PDNet), which leverages both synthetic and real-world images in training process. The overall network follows a progressive architecture, and can be divided into three core stages: image encode stage (IES), feature enhance stage (FES) and hierarchical reconstruction stage (HRS). Specifically, IES is responsible for encoding shallow features from the corrupted hazy image. Then, our FES tries to distill finer local and global features via the well-designed dual stream attentive block (DSAB). The HRS is to estimate semantic and contextual information based on a hierarchical structure, and accurately reconstructs the final clear image. This stage-by-stage paradigm can make full use of informative features from shallow to deep, thus facilitating network for better haze removal. Furthermore, we utilize an unlabeled con-trastive guidance (UCG) to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and real-world images. Extensive experimental comparisons show that our Semi-PDNet can obtain comparable results with other state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the loss of underwater light resources, monitoring fish situations in underwater surveillance has led to fish distortion. Monitoring and observing fish situations in culture ponds around the world is becoming more and more important to prevent them from suffering uncertain damage. In this study, we propose a stereo underwater surveillance system for Oplegnathus punctatus by developing an underwater depth prediction model and an underwater fish skeleton model based on deep learning. The underwater depth prediction model is a convolutional neural network-based method for extracting underwater depth spatial features. The fish skeleton prediction model is for extracting 9 keypoints on the fish body. Additionally, since there is no established underwater Oplegnathus punctatus dataset for fish body analysis in culture ponds, we have collected and proposed a depth and skeleton Oplegnathus punctatus dataset, which contains underwater information on Oplegnathus punctatus bodies. The experimental results on our self-collected dataset show that the fish body information measurement achieves 94% accuracy in weight. We also compared our proposed method with Mask-RCNN and stereo-matching methods, and our method proved to be the most effective.

AB Providing decision makers with more information is often expected to result in more informed and superior decisions. This is especially true when leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to explore and find complex patterns in vast amounts of data. Although AI can enable an "information advantage," truly intelligent systems should buffer scarce human cognitive resources from information overload and be well adapted to the environment in which they are deployed. Paradoxically, some practitioners have conflated AI's information processing superiority with a contradictory decision-support goal: to provide human decision makers with more, higher quality, or more novel courses of action, regardless of context, than they could generate without AI. In this article, I review the evidence examining the costs and benefits of providing decision makers with more or less choice and identify the factors that moderate the relationship between the amount of choice and decision effectiveness. Although providing more information and choice increases confidence and certainty in one's decision, it can make decision making more difficult, decrease satisfaction, and result in poorer decision outcomes. The research indicates that such negative effects are influenced by the level of entropy and variety provided and can be reduced with increased familiarity but are further compounded when decisions are increasingly effortful, difficult, or complex. The review concludes with guidance on how designers might leverage knowledge of choice overload and associated moderator effects to create more adaptive and effective decision support systems.

AB An efficient river crossing project (RCP) requires careful planning, front-end design, installation and maintenance. It is important to evaluate different influencing factors and crossing techniques, such as horizontal directional drilling, microtunneling, direct pipe, guided auger boring, open cut, trenchless, trenched, semi-trenched, airborne, and bridging, using risk-adjusted methodologies. In order to evaluate different influencing factors of RCP, we can apply our decision-making approach in the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy 2-tuple linguistic (DHq-ROF-TL) environment. In this article, we utilize the q-ROF set, a most efficient set having a broader membership and non-membership representational domain, with the 2-tuple linguistic (2TL) framework to avoid information loss during decision-making process under dual hesitant fuzzy (DHF) environment. DHF set can effectively address human hesitance in decision-making difficulties and provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach of allocating numbers to each domain element. The Hamy mean (HM) operator is a classical mean type of aggregation operator utilized in modern information fusion theory which is appropriate to aggregate DHq-ROF-TL information. The HM operator can capture the interrelationships among the arguments of the alternatives. Furthermore, the DHq-ROF-TL Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLHM) operator, DHq-ROF-TL weighted Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLWHM) operator, the DHq-ROF-TL dual Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLDHM) operator and DHq-ROF-TL weighted dual Hamy mean (DHq-ROF-TLWDHM) operator are proposed along with some desirable properties and special cases. Afterward, based on developed aggregation operators in the DHq-ROF-TL framework, a novel approach is established to tackle multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. Eventually, an example of a RCP is presented to demonstrate the usefulness and appropriateness of the developed approach. To analyze the advantages and superiorities of the developed approach, a comparative analysis is conducted.

AB Image synthesis has recently been identified as a sensitive issue due to the enormous volume of data required to function deep learning models. Deep learning models are used for various issues to support medical imaging, speech synthesis and text-to-speech and text-to-image conversion. Several machine-learning approaches exist but suffer to achieve higher accuracy and stability. To handle this issue, an efficient multi-variant feature synthesis image generation model is presented. The model works with the generative adversarial network (GAN) structure, which generates synthesis images according to different features like shape, color and object. The generator uses such features to generate multiple variations of images according to various compositions. The discriminator, in turn, classifies the image and returns values to the same, which is iterated a number of times till the negative classification becomes less. The generator is an inverse convolution neural network model, and the discriminator is a CNN classifier with probability. The method has been designed with the neurons to compute shape transition measure, color transition measure and object transition measure. Using each of these techniques, the method calculates the value of image synthesis support to produce multiple results from the generator. Similarly, the discriminator is designed to measure multi-variant feature synthesis support to identify the class of image. The classification accuracy of the model is 95% when compared to the classification accuracy of the KT-GAN, DR-GAN and BSD-GAN models. There are only 5% of instances that are incorrectly classified, according to the 5% false classification ratio. The model's stability is also 95%, indicating consistent and dependable performance across several runs or modifications. The method introduces higher performance in stability and presents higher classification performance.

AB Solving the energy management (EM) problem in microgrids with the incorporation of demand response programs helps in achieving technical and economic advantages and enhancing the load curve characteristics. The EM problem, with its large number of constraints, is considered as a nonlinear optimization problem. Artificial rabbits optimization has an exceptional performance, however there is no single algorithm can solve all engineering problem. So, this paper proposes a modified version of artificial rabbits optimization algorithm, called QARO, by quantum mechanics based on Monte Carlo method to determine the optimal scheduling for MG resources effectively. The main objective is minimization of the daily operating cost with the maximization of MG operator (MGO) benefit. The operating cost includes the conventional diesel generator operating cost and the cost of power transactions with the grid. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using different standard benchmark test functions. A ranking order for the test function based on the average value and Tied rank technique, Wilcoxon's rank test based on median value, and Anova Kruskal-Wallis test showed that QARO achieved best results on the most functions and outperforms all other compared technique. The obtained results of the proposed QARO are compared with those obtained by employing well-known and newly-developed algorithms. Moreover, the proposed QARO is used to solve two case studies of day-ahead EM problem in MG, then the obtained results are also compared with other well-known optimization techniques, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of QARO in reducing the operating cost and maximization the MGO benefit.

AB In today's hypercompetitive marketing environment in order to significantly boost sales revenue, supplier frequently offers allowable credit duration to the retailer for payment (also known as "trade credit"). Additionally, warehouse capacity constraints can create logistical challenges when orders exceed a retailer's own storage space, requiring additional costs for rented warehouse. In addition, due to globalization in marketing strategy, supplier is now offering to the retailers' order volume discount linked with price and trade credit. In addition to this, this study considers carbon emissions that occur during the production and storage of goods at the supplier inventory system, and the retailer is responsible for covering the costs associated with each emission that was generated during product transportation and storage. The unit production cost, which is reliant on the production rate, and shortages of the commodities are permissible which is partially backordered. The optimum production and replenishment practices for the both supplier and the retailer are determined after the establishment of a novel algorithm. Eventually, several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical findings. The sensitivity analysis subject to the primary parameters is incorporated to verify the reliability of the proposed study which leads to some intriguing managerial insights that will help the manager or decision-maker to make some suitable and qualitative decisions.

DE Invisible orthodontics; Orthodontic automation; Orthodontic path
   planning; Improved grey wolf optimization algorithm
AB Automatic tooth arrangement and path planning play an essential role in computer-aided orthodontic treatment. However, state-of-the-art methods have some shortcomings: low efficiency, excessive cost of displacements or collisions and insufficient accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative orthodontic path planning method based on the improved gray wolf optimization algorithm, which is called OPP-IGWO. First, the tooth model is preprocessed to obtain initial pose in which each tooth is segmented and built up with an oriented bounding box. Next, the target pose of each tooth is determined through the ideal dental arch curve and the optimal jaw principle. Finally, the path from the initial pose to the target pose of each tooth is planned based on IGWO, which is improved mainly from three aspects: (1) The greedy idea is adopted to initialize the gray wolf population based on dental interpolation. (2) The linear convergence factor in the traditional gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) is replaced with a nonlinear convergence factor. (3) We propose a position update strategy based on a dynamic weighting approach, which introduces a learning rate for each gray wolf. The experimental results show that our OPP-IGWO method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Compared with improved genetic algorithm, multiparticle improved swarm optimization, normal simplified mean particle swarm optimization algorithm, improved artificial bee colony algorithm, chaotic gray wolf optimization algorithm, hybrid gray wolf optimization algorithm and differential evolution algorithm, random walk gray wolf Optimization algorithm and reinforcement learning gray wolf optimization algorithm, the OPP-IGWO has an improvement on performance by 15.46%, 2.24%, 7.18%, 15.99%, 7.67%, 1.01%, 1.42%, 10.23%, respectively.

AB As internet use increases dramatically, an increasing number of industries, including the financial one, are operationalizing their services online. Due to the significant financial losses, they cause that financial fraud is becoming a big issue as it spreads globally and grows in both volume and variety. Financial fraud detection systems should be used to identify dangers like unauthorized access and erratic assaults. During the last several years, this problem has been extensively addressed using machine learning and data mining approaches. These methods still need to be developed in order to cope with massive data, compute quickly, and spot new attack patterns. As a result, in this research, a deep learning-based approach based on the stacked temporal convolution network technique is provided for the identification of financial fraud. This model aims to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of existing detection methods in the context of large data. In addition, a flower pollination optimization process is incorporated for feature selection, which addresses any side effects that may result from choosing the best features. An actual dataset of credit card, loan, and insurance frauds is used to assess the proposed model, and the results are contrasted with those of current deep learning methods. The experimental results show that the suggested FPO_QCNN achieves 99.95%, 99.95%, 99.95% of accuracy for credit card, insurance, and Mortgage Data set.

AB With the rapid development of Internet technology, Internet technology is crucial to people's life. This paper uses machine learning to analyze customer shopping behavior data in detail. In the huge customer behavior data, how to tap the potential information value of customers, how to explore customer needs and behavior rules, etc. are still the key content of customer behavior research. Nowadays, user behavior research has become a hot topic at home and abroad, and artificial intelligence has played a very important role in the field of automated learning in e-commerce applications. Due to the rapid development of information technology and the continuous progress of e-commerce market, customers are more and more interested in commodity trade on electronic platforms, and online shopping has become an important software for shopping in today's society. E-commerce is going through an era of big data, generating huge data information about consumer behavior every day, including the analysis of customer behavior on e-commerce websites, and taking customer browsing data and customer purchasing behavior data as the main source of data extraction from potential customers. On this basis, the specific information about e-commerce potential customer behavior data is extracted through the hybrid algorithm of data roughness and decision tree algorithm. At the same time, effective, accurate and timely behavior goals should be achieved to attract potential customer resources. Finally, we use analysis and simulation methods to extract important values from the previous research data of e-commerce websites. Therefore, the experimental results show that this method can produce an ideal decision tree model, and it is easier to understand and interpret the rules of customer behavior extraction, so as to understand more accurate customer behavior.

AB This article focuses on user-centered site collaboration strategies. The main site collaboration of the collaboration framework is to provide services to target users. First, the same cellular network is modeled according to the same Poisson point process model to indicate the target user's radius formula; the energy consumption and user level of the collaboration set are related to the collaboration radius, and a specific user level is created. Solve the optimization problem with the lowest energy consumption in a set of collaborative requirements. And based on the traditional dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) that deals with unequal length vectors in one-dimensional samples, this article focuses on the similarity between spatial two-dimensional matrix samples, improves research from different perspectives, and expands the construction of the processing matrix. The new algorithm of sample DTW is used to solve the problem of distance measurement between matrix samples and unequal size matrix samples. Based on the traditional dynamic time warping algorithm, a line-by-line DTW smart finance is proposed. The algorithm uses the distance matrix to calculate the DTW distance by calculating the DTW distance between the rows of the matrix samples, introduces the intermediate distance matrix, and uses the distance matrix to calculate the DTW distance. The standardized DTW distance is used as the final matrix distance. Multiple DTW distance calculations significantly improve the matrix samples. Finally, perform functional realization and system testing on the designed system, and confirm the normal operation of the financial management system based on the test results. This paper is mainly based on the dynamic time warping algorithm for heterogeneous cellular networks and applies it to the research of intelligent financial management system to improve the efficiency of financial management.

AB In today's era of information, digitization and intelligence, the share of graphic information is increasing, and it has become an important tool for receiving and transmitting information. Digital images are widely used in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing. However, the process of acquisition and transmission can often cause distortion and noise, which can significantly reduce the quality of the image. Therefore, image denoising is an important post-processing step that aims to suppress noise and improve the image quality. Speech recognition has become one of the most important technologies for improving intelligent human-computer interaction. With the increasing popularity of voice interactive products and services, speech recognition technology has been widely researched and applied in various fields. Meanwhile, the importance of design education has been recognized and given more attention in the context of basic education reform. The creation of a "design and application" research field can promote the development of design education and help students develop their creativity, spatial perception ability, and aesthetic ability.

AB In order to study a reliable classification model of educational methods, this paper uses improved multi-label transfer learning as the basic algorithm to construct an educational method classification model based on improved multi-label transfer learning. Moreover, this paper restructures the data set into a multi-category data set by coupling other labels to reduce the ratio of unbalanced labels and uses a binary classifier to predict each single label and combines the multi-class classifier and the binary classifier to output the label prediction of the multi-label data. Considering the importance of label information in multi-label data, this paper adds metric migration learning on the basis of transfer learning and proposes a multi-label metric migration learning model MLMTL. With the aid of metric learning, the model effectively retains the inherent geometric information of the feature space and label space. The experimental results demonstrate that the model constructed in this paper is highly effective, with a low distortion rate and high classification accuracy. This indicates that the system is capable of accurately identifying and classifying music education data and provides a reliable and efficient platform for students and teachers to access and manage educational materials.

AB High-resolution remote sensing images not only improve the processing quality of image information, but also become more effective, accurate, and clear in specific practical applications such as feature recognition, classification, and object detection. The construction and development of urban wetland parks have become a new trend in urban construction both domestically and internationally. This article first builds a map symbol library and formulates data processing rules based on ArcGIS software, and designs a high-resolution GIS image flowchart. Adding jump connections to the convolutional neural network can effectively improve the performance of the overall network model. By utilizing the advantages of jump connections in convolutional neural networks, a more dense connection network is proposed through multiple uses and improvements in convolutional neural networks. Finally, design a wetland park environmental data monitoring platform and analyze and process the data based on the wetland park environmental monitoring indicators. The research results indicate that the algorithm proposed in this paper retrieves most high-frequency information without adding too much noise. The edge sharpening effect of traditional algorithms is relatively poor, and the model proposed in this paper outperforms other super-resolution reconstruction algorithms, improving the performance of the model in terms of visual effects in remote sensing image reconstruction. The typical application scenario of wetland protection and management based on temporal and spatial data constructed in this article has achieved large-scale, fast, and accurate analysis of wetland resource conditions, and verified the application support capabilities of cloud computing platforms.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) includes billions of different devices and various applications that generate a huge amount of data. Due to inherent resource limitations, reliable and robust data transmission for a huge number of heterogenous devices is one of the most critical issues for IoT. Therefore, cluster-based data transmission is appropriate for IoT applications as it promotes network lifetime and scalability. On the other hand, Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture improves flexibility and makes the IoT respond appropriately to the heterogeneity. This article proposes an SDN-based efficient clustering scheme for IoT using the Improved Sailfish optimization (ISFO) algorithm. In the proposed model, clustering of IoT devices is performed using the ISFO model and the model is installed on the SDN controller to manage the Cluster Head (CH) nodes of IoT devices. The performance evaluation of the proposed model was performed based on two scenarios with 150 and 300 nodes. The results show that for 150 nodes ISFO model in comparison with LEACH, LEACH-E reduced energy consumption by about 21.42% and 17.28%. For 300 ISFO nodes compared to LEACH, LEACH-E reduced energy consumption by about 37.84% and 27.23%.

AB This article analyzes the correlation between energy poverty percentage and unem-ployment rate for four European countries, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, comparing the results with the European average. The time series extracted from the datasets were imported in a hybrid model, namely ARIMA-ARNN, generating predictions for the two variables in order to analyze their interconnectivity. The results obtained from the hybrid model suggest that unemployment rate and energy poverty percentage have comparable tendencies, being strongly correlated. The forecasts suggest that this correlation will be maintained in the future unless appropriate governmental policies are implemented in order to lower the impact of other aspects on energy poverty.

AB The integration of image segmentation technology into packaging style design significantly amplifies both the aesthetic allure and practical utility of product packaging design. However, the conventional image segmentation algorithm necessitates a substantial amount of time for image analysis, rendering it susceptible to the loss of vital image features and yielding unsatisfactory segmentation results. Therefore, this study introduces a novel segmentation network, G-Lite-DeepLabV3+, which is seamlessly incorporated into cyber-physical systems (CPS) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of product packaging image segmentation. In this research, the feature extraction network of DeepLabV3 is replaced with Mobilenetv2, integrating group convolution and attention mechanisms to proficiently process intricate semantic features and improve the network's responsiveness to valuable characteristics. These adaptations are then deployed within CPS, allowing the G-Lite-DeepLabV3+ network to be seamlessly integrated into the image processing module within CPS. This integration facilitates remote and real-time segmentation of product packaging images in a virtual environment.Experimental findings demonstrate that the G-Lite-DeepLabV3+ network excels at segmenting diverse graphical elements within product packaging images. Compared to the original DeepLabV3+ network, the intersection over union (IoU) metric shows a remarkable increase of 3.1%, while the mean pixel accuracy (mPA) exhibits an impressive improvement of 6.2%. Additionally, the frames per second (FPS) metric experiences a significant boost of 22.1%. When deployed within CPS, the network successfully accomplishes product packaging image segmentation tasks with enhanced efficiency, while maintaining high levels of segmentation accuracy.

DE Face aging; Conditional GANs; Dual-learning; Landmark attention
ID PERCEPTION; SKELETON
AB Face aging is an active area of research in multimedia applications that involves modifying a person's facial photo to resemble their appearance at a different age. While conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have made significant progress in this field, most current approaches still face challenges in generating convincing age progression while preserving the subject's identity. These limitations arise due to three main factors: i) a scarcity of long-range sequential labelled faces of the same person in existing datasets, which are required for training; ii) a focus on texture changes such as wrinkles, which neglects structural variations that are important in aging and limit the effectiveness of these models for large age spans; and iii) the tendency to preserve personal identity by minimizing the differences between inputs and synthesized results, which can result in blurry artifacts and insufficient variations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these limitations called Landmark-guided Dual-learning cGAN (LDcGAN), which includes a multi-attention mechanism. Our approach uses an external landmark attention to adjust variations in facial structure and a built-in attention to emphasize the most discriminative regions relevant to aging. The primal cGAN is conditioned with age vectors and converts input faces to target ages, while the dual cGAN inverts the process by feeding the synthesized results back to the original input age range. This enables LDcGAN to improve age consistency and minimize changes that affect personal identity and background. Our approach demonstrates appealing results in terms of image quality, personal identity, and age accuracy, as confirmed by both qualitative and quantitative experiments.

AB Irregular packing in e-commerce warehouses is a special case of a three-dimensional box packing problem (3DBPP). It is necessary to select the type and quantity of boxes and determine the location and orientation of the items to maximize the use of the loading space. In this paper, a spatial particle model of the 3DBPP for multiple boxes and irregular items is constructed using the three-dimensional (3D) point cloud and granulation method. In the model, the 3D point cloud is used to describe the shapes of irregular items, and the granulation method is used for the transformation from sparse and uneven point clouds to spatial particle convex hulls. In addition, we designed an empirical simulation algorithm (ESA) based on the combination of expert rules extracted in practical packing activities and empirical simulation, and an intelligent algorithm for 3DBPPs with irregular items combined with the framework of the deep Q network (DQN) algorithm in deep reinforcement learning. An instance generator is proposed based on industry data to generate realistic projects with representative attributes for the above two algorithms, such as types of boxes, irregular items, 3D spatial plane convex hulls, and spatially granular data. The numerical results show that the ESA can quickly obtain a high-quality packing scheme, and the intelligent DQN packing algorithm in deep reinforcement learning can avoid the limitation of expert rules and achieve a better scheme with a certain time for the training process.

AB The broad learning system (BLS) is a novel flat neural network that is fast and effective in various pattern recognition and classification applications. Many researchers have investigated this learning approach due to its remarkable performance. However, the feature nodes used in BLS are mapped with random weights for the input data, which is inefficient and can lead to inferior results since the random mapping contains redundant and unpredictable information for constructing the feature nodes. To resolve this issue and improve BLS, in this study, we aim to present one representation induced method, i.e., the collaborative representation induced broad learning model (CRI_BLM), to replace the random mapping for producing the feature nodes. This proposed method introduces the collaborative representation technique to code the input training sample as a collaborative linear combination (coding coefficient) of all dictionary samples, before further generating the enhancement nodes under the broad learning framework for classification. Compared to the original feature nodes with random mapping, this approach can capture more effective features for pattern recognition and classification. Extensive experiments with several datasets and comparisons with various classifiers were investigated to confirm that our proposed CRI_BLM is remarkable and effective (e.g., obtaining the best result: 96.80% in the Fifteen Scene Categories database).

AB The activities of muscles in the forearm have been widely investigated to develop human interfaces involving hand motions, especially in the fields of prosthetic hands and teleoperation. Although surface electromyography (sEMG) is considered as an effective biological signal from which hand motions can be recognized, the availability and quality of sEMG data can limit the usability and intuitiveness of human interfaces. This article introduces force myography (FMG) as a supplementary signal and proposes a layered sEMG-FMG hybrid sensor that can measure both sEMG and FMG at the same skin surface location. Meanwhile, a layer fusion convolution neural network (LFC) is designed to extract multiscale features from sEMG and FMG. To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid sEMG-FMG sensor and LFC, a 22-hand motion classification experiment was conducted on nine able-bodied subjects. The recognition results indicated a significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.001) of the hybrid sEMG-FMG modality with respect to single sEMG or FMG modality. The classification accuracies (CAs) of LFC were compared with conventional machine learning methods, including support vector machine, random forest classifier, xgboost, and k-nearest neighbor. Compared with the single-modality sEMG, the CAs of the dual-modality sEMG-FMG using conventional methods, and LFC were improved by 21.31% and 16.71%, respectively. These results suggest that the layered sEMG-FMG sensing approach can effectively enhance the performance of human interfaces, which offers great potential in the clinical applications of sophisticated prosthetic hands and teleoperation.

AB Contrastive learning has achieved remarkable success on various high-level tasks, but there are fewer contrastive learning-based methods proposed for low-level tasks. It is challenging to adopt vanilla contrastive learning technologies proposed for high-level visual tasks to low-level image restoration problems straightly. Because the acquired high-level global visual representations are insufficient for low-level tasks requiring rich texture and context information. In this article, we investigate the contrastive learning-based single-image super-resolution (SISR) from two perspectives: positive and negative sample construction and feature embedding. The existing methods take naive sample construction approaches (e.g., considering the low-quality input as a negative sample and the ground truth as a positive sample) and adopt a prior model (e.g., pretrained very deep convolutional networks proposed by visual geometry group (VGG) model) to obtain the feature embedding. To this end, we propose a practical contrastive learning framework for SISR (PCL-SR). We involve the generation of many informative positive and hard negative samples in frequency space. Instead of utilizing an additional pretrained network, we design a simple but effective embedding network inherited from the discriminator network, which is more task-friendly. Compared with the existing benchmark methods, we retrain them by our proposed PCL-SR framework and achieve superior performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness and technical contributions of our proposed PCL-SR thorough ablation studies. The code and resulting models will be released via https://github.com/Aitical/PCL-SISR.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been widely and successfully applied in the image computer vision community, and obtained great advances in single image super-resolution (SR). However, most of the existing SR methods focus on designing networks with deeper or wider structures for better performance and suffer from the problem of heavy computational costs. To address this problem, we propose a novel Context Feature Guided Network (CFGN), which is an efficient and effective lightweight SR method. Specifically, To capture semantic features effectively, we propose a novel block, called context feature guided convolution (CFGC), to capture more discriminative features while enlarging the receptive field. Moreover, we design a novel context feature guided group (CFGG) to exploit the multi-scale context information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with a good trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, compared with the proposed method over the state-of-the-art lightweight SR methods.

AB Facial expression is one of the most powerful, natural, and universal signals for human beings to express emotional states and intentions. There are many applications for facial expression recognition (FER) in human society such as healthcare. Thus, the importance of correct and innovative FER approaches in Artificial Intelligence is evident. However, commonly used methods suffer from a lack of classification generalization in FER. To tackle this problem, we propose a generic facial expression recognition network based on evolutionary neural architecture search, called ENAS-FERNet, which can automatically evolve neural network architectures using both laboratory-controlled and in-the-wild FER datasets. The experiments of ENAS-FERNet were carefully designed and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the case of training from scratch. In addition, we validated the interference resistance of ENAS-FERNet on the synthetic noisy FER dataset and analyzed the time consumption of ENAS-FERNet. Comprehensive experimental analysis and results show that the proposed ENAS-FERNet method achieves the most well-known results on the CK+, Affect-Net, and RAF-DB (10%) datasets, as well as competitive results on the JAFFE, RAF-DB, and RAF-DB (20%) datasets. The results of these experiments show that our ENAS-FERNet has good classification generalization capabilities on these challenging datasets.

ID NETWORK
AB Anomaly detection, in recent years, has gained increasing attention in the research and practice of time series processing. However, the task is particularly challenging with multivariate time series which complicates the temporal dependency between observations and introduces complex inter-channel correlation. Meanwhile, in order to fit a broader range of applications, robustness during both training and detection is also a critical aspect. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, hybrid model-driven anomaly detection scheme capable of (1) transforming sequences into a fused representation of temporal dependency embeddings and inter-channel correlation embeddings, and (2) achieving robust anomaly detection using a temporal prediction network for sample-wise posterior estimation combined with a data reconstruction network to assess the source of prediction. On this basis, we develop a probability density-based anomaly scoring mechanism for online detection in multivariate time series, where the anomaly score for each observation is rectified by the reliability of the prediction source. The results of extensive experiments on five publicly available datasets show that our proposed solution outperforms various state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms (including DL-based and non-DL-based), achieving a performance improvement (in F1-Score) by up to 10.42%.

AB Load forecasting with low prediction error is essential to keep minimizing costs in generating and supplying power. It has many applications in energy production, distribution, and infrastructure construction. Because of the high autocorrelation and strong seasonality in load data, it is difficult to build robust and generalizable forecasting models. To address the problem, we propose a hybrid model, the Fourier Split NET (FSNET). The proposed model consists of two phases. A deseasonalization phase where the model uses the Fourier transform to isolate the seasonal component from the data using the fast Fourier transform. The second phase consists of training a simple linear model to replicate the seasonal behavior of the data and training a group of LSTM neural networks on different clusters of the data. The model uses statistical features to build separate LSTM models for different groups of data. We experimented on open datasets and obtained higher accuracy results compared to other forecasting approaches using different accuracy metrics.

DE Graph convolution neural network (GCN); neighborhood aggregation;
   network architecture design; power flow; uncertain power injections
AB Probabilistic analysis tool is important to quantify the impacts of the uncertainties on power system operations. However, the repetitive calculations of power flow are time-consuming. To address this issue, data-driven approaches are proposed but they are not robust to the uncertain injections and varying topology. This article proposes a model-driven graph convolution neural network (MD-GCN) for power flow calculation with high-computational efficiency and good robustness to topology changes. Compared with the basic graph convolution neural network (GCN), the construction of MD-GCN considers the physical connection relationships among different nodes. This is achieved by embedding the linearized power flow model into the layer-wise propagation. Such a structure enhances the interpretability of the network forward propagation. To ensure that enough features are extracted in MD-GCN, a new input feature construction method with multiple neighborhood aggregations and a global pooling layer are developed. This allows us to integrate both global features and neighborhood features, yielding the complete features representation of the system-wide impacts on every single node. Numerical results on the IEEE 30-bus, 57-bus, 118-bus, and 1354-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better performance as compared to other approaches in the presence of uncertain power injections and system topology.

AB Incremental random weight networks (IRWNs) face the issues of weak generalization and complicated network structure. There is an important reason: the learning parameters of IRWNs are determined in a random fashion without guidance, which may increase many redundant hidden nodes, and thereby leading to inferior performance. To resolve this issue, a novel IRWN with compact constraint that guides the assignment of random learning parameters (CCIRWN) is developed in this brief. Using the iteration method of Greville, a compact constraint that simultaneously assures the quality of generated hidden nodes and the convergence of the CCIRWN is built to perform learning parameter configuration. Meanwhile, the output weights of the CCIRWN are assessed analytically. Two types of learning methods for constructing the CCIRWN are proposed. Finally, the performance evaluation of the proposed CCIRWN is undertaken on the 1-D nonlinear function approximation, several real-world datasets, and data-driven estimation based on the industrial data. Numerical and industrial examples indicate that the proposed CCIRWN with compact structure can achieve favorable generalization ability.

TI High-Dimensional Feature Selection Based on Improved Binary Ant Colony

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB In the realm of high-dimensional data analysis, numerous fields stand to benefit from its applications, including the biological and medical sectors that are crucial for computer-aided disease diagnosis and prediction systems. However, the presence of a significant number of redundant or irrelevant features can adversely affect system accuracy and real-time diagnosis efficiency. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes two innovative wrapper feature selection (FS) methods that integrate the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm and hybrid rice optimization (HRO). HRO is a recently developed metaheuristic that mimics the breeding process of the three-line hybrid rice, which is yet to be thoroughly explored in the context of solving high-dimensional FS problems. In the first hybridization, ACO is embedded as an evolutionary operator within HRO and updated alternately with it. In the second form of hybridization, two subpopulations evolve independently, sharing the local search results to assist individual updating. In the initial stage preceding hybridization, a problem-oriented heuristic factor assignment strategy based on the importance of the knee point feature is introduced to enhance the global search capability of ACO in identifying the smallest and most representative features. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on fourteen high-dimensional biomedical datasets and compared with other recently advanced FS methods. Experimental results suggest that the proposed methods are efficient and computationally robust, exhibiting superior performance compared to the other algorithms involved in this study.

AB Real-time object detection is an integral part of internet of things (IoT) application, which is an important research field of computer vision. Existing lightweight algorithms cannot handle target occlusions well in target detection tasks in indoor narrow scenes, resulting in a large number of missed detections and misclassifications. To this end, an accurate real-time multi-scale detection method that integrates density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm and the improved You Only Look Once (YOLO)-v4-tiny network is proposed. First, by improving the neck network of the YOLOv4-tiny model, the detailed information of the shallow network is utilized to boost the average precision of the model to identify dense small objects, and the Cross mini-Batch Normalization strategy is adopted to improve the accuracy of statistical information. Second, the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is fused with the modified network to achieve better clustering effects. Finally, Mosaic data enrichment technique is adopted during model training process to improve the capability of the model to recognize occluded targets. Experimental results show that compared to the original YOLOv4-tiny algorithm, the mAP values of the improved algorithm on the self-construct dataset are significantly improved, and the processing speed can well meet the requirements of real-time applications on embedded devices. The performance of the proposed model on public datasets PASCAL VOC07 and PASCAL VOC12 is also better than that of other advanced lightweight algorithms, and the detection ability for occluded objects is significantly improved, which meets the requirements of mobile terminals for real-time detection in crowded indoor environments.

DE Complex events; Human-centric video analysis; Dataset and benchmark
AB Along with the development of modern smart cities, human-centric video analysis has been encountering the challenge of analyzing diverse and complex events in real scenes. A complex event relates to dense crowds, anomalous individuals, or collective behaviors. However, limited by the scale and coverage of existing video datasets, few human analysis approaches have reported their performances on such complex events. To this end, we presenta new large-scale dataset with comprehensive annotations, named human-in-events or human-centric video analysis in complex events (HiEve), for the understanding of human motions, poses, and actions in a variety of realistic events, especially in crowd and complex events. It contains a record number of poses (> 1 M), the largest number of action instances (> 56k) under complex events, as well as one of the largest numbers of trajectories lasting for longer time (with an average trajectory length of >480 frames). Based on its diverse annotation, we present two simple baselines for action recognition and pose estimation, respectively. They leverage cross-label information during training to enhance the feature learning in corresponding visual tasks. Experiments show that they could boost the performance of existing action recognition and pose estimation pipelines. More importantly, they prove the widely ranged annotations in HiEve can improve various video tasks. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark recent video analysis approaches together with our baseline methods, demonstrating HiEve is a challenging dataset for human-centric video analysis. We expect that the dataset will advance the development of cutting-edge techniques in human-centric analysis and the understanding of complex events. The dataset is available at http://humaninevents.org.

AB Fuzzy cognitive networks (FCNs) arose from traditional fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to have the advantage of guaranteed convergence to equilibrium points, thus being more suitable than conventional FCMs for a variety of pattern recognition and system identification tasks. Moreover, recent developments led to FCNs with functional weights (FCNs-FW), as a significant FCNs enhancement in terms of storage requirements, efficiency and less human intervention requirements. In this paper we proceed further by introducing hybrid deep learning structures, interweaving FCNs-FW with well established deep neural network (DNN) representative structures and apply the new schemes on a variety of pattern recognition and time series prediction tasks. More specifically, after discussing general issues related to the construction of deep learning structures using FCNs-FW we present three hybrid models, which combine the FCN-FW with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), echo state networks (ESNs) and AutoEncoder (AE) schemes, respectively. The hybrid schemes are tested on diverse benchmark data sets and prove that FCN-FW based hybrid schemes perform equally well or better than state-of-the-art DNN-based schemes, paving thus the way for using cognitive networks to deep learning representative structures.

AB This paper investigates the problem of stability and stabilization for Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems with adaptive event-triggered scheme (AETS) based on sampled-data control. AETS is used to relieve network congestion and save bandwidth resources. A novel Lyapunov-Krosovskii functional (LKF) is proposed by introducing the available information of fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) and sampling instant. The FMFs approach, extended reciprocal convex inequality technique and some slack matrices are fully utilized to deal with the derivative of the LKF. Then, an improved criterion with less conservatism is obtained to guarantee the stability of T-S fuzzy system. Moreover, the standard conditions are given in the form of linear matrix inequalities by the matrix decoupling technique. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method can be demonstrated through a numerical simulation.

AB In this article, the problem of fixed-time adaptive fuzzy control is addressed for a class of nonaffine nonlinear systems subject to unknown backlash-like hysteresis nonlinearities. A command filter-based adaptive fuzzy fixed-time control strategy is presented via combining the backstepping framework with fixed-time control theory. The packaged unknown nonlinearities appeared in the controller design process are estimated by adopting fuzzy logic systems. At the same time, the "explosion of complex" difficulty occurred in conventional backstepping algorithm is eliminated by adopting a command filter technique and corresponding error compensation signals are exploited to alleviate the influence of the errors generated by command filters. It is further shown that the developed controller not only guarantees the boundedness of all the closed-loop system signals, but also makes the output tracking error arrive a small neighbor around the origin within a fixed time. Finally, both theoretical analysis and simulation research are carried out to further test the feasibility of the presented methodology.

AB Measuring the performance of national wastes is essential for ensuing the environmental protection and moving toward the circular economy objective. To cope with the uncertainty involving in many circular indicators, this study first proposed a fuzzy game approach network data envelopment analysis model for the waste management evaluation. The proposed model considers maximizing the potential joint efficiencies of the production and recycling processes simultaneously from the centralized control and circular economy perspective. A real-case study on assessing the waste management performance of European Union countries is provided. The factor efficiency analysis and associated ranks of the process efficiencies provide a guidance for identifying the factor dominance in the production and recycling processes. A comparison of the proposed method with other approaches is also included. Our results provide the European Union policy makers a valuable information to move waste management up the European Union waste hierarchy by allowing reusing, recycling, and recovering energy from the waste.

AB In new industrial product development, human-involvement conceptual design evaluation (CDE) is an information-intensive and multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) process. To capture and formalize the uncertain information from decision-makers (DMs), several derivations of fuzzy number such as triangular intuitionistic fuzzy number (TIFN), Z-number, and interval number have been employed in CDE, which only cover limited information. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, a new kind of fuzzy number by taking advantage of TIFN, Z-number and interval number, i.e., interval intuitionistic fuzzy-Z-number (IIFZN), is presented to utilize DM's preference value (PV) for alternative, as well as his important rating (IR) and familiarity degree (FD) judgements for evaluation criterion. IIFZN is composed of not only the membership and non-membership of PV or IR, but also the affiliated confidence coefficient transformed from FD. Then, in terms of the IIFZN-based decision-making matrix, this study proposes new ideal solution definition rules and distance measurement metric in technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to form a new TOPSIS-IIFZN method. The proposed method will enable DM easily find the alternative which is most preferable for important and familiar criteria and least preferred for less important and unfamiliar criteria as the best one. It is more rational than traditional PV-only CDE method, which will help company to save manufacturing resources. Besides theoretical research, one practical example and three more complex comparative experiments have been carried out to validate the performance of TOPSIS-IIFZN. By comparing with other MCGDM methods using different types of fuzzy numbers, it proves that TOPSIS-IIFZN can obtain more reasonable evaluation results. Meanwhile, besides PV, the RI and FD factors also play great influences in CDE.

AB Nowadays, the bilevel multi-objective optimization problem has been received extensive attention from scholars. As two mainstream algorithms to solve it, intelligent algorithm and interactive algorithm based on satisfaction have disadvantages such as slow operation speed and too much subjectivity in weight selection, respectively. This paper proposes a multi-attribute decision-making method based on fuzzy weight, which is a natural generalization of deterministic weight, and it can cope with the decision-making risks brought by uncertain environment, which has strong robustness. Meanwhile the new deviation function index proposed could reflect that the upper and lower decision-makers execute the final decision with the same enthusiasm, which is convenient to make exploratory decisions in unknown environment. Finally, compared with the traditional existing methods, the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicator is verified by the garbage classification game in the main urban district of Chongqing.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper investigates security control for linear parameter-varying partial differential equation systems under an improved dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). Initially, based on the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, the nonlinear terms of the considered systems are approximated. Then, pointwise measurements are introduced to reduce the number of sensors. To further abate the transmission channel congestion caused by the limited bandwidth, an improved DETM is offered. Besides, point fuzzy controller is constructed to save control costs by utilizing limited actuators. Especially, in the networked control framework, the appearance of attacks will pose a serious threat to the systems' stability. To simulate complex forms of attacks, dual deception attacks are taken into account. Moreover, some appropriate parameter-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals are employed to obtain correlated conditions that ensure the exponential stability of the target system. Finally, numerical and application examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design methods. The average trigger rate in the two cases is reduced to 4.58% and 3.68%, respectively.

AB Nowadays, web robots are a big part of web and useful in many cases. But, there are malicious web robots that need to be detected. Web robots often conceal their navigations by sending requests with incorrect or no information. It can be quite difficult to correctly and precisely classify this kind of incomplete data, including missing values. Previous studies have used IP addresses and user agent names to overcome this challenge, but these methods are unreliable. In order to solve this challenge, this paper has presented a robust algorithm named FRS-SIFS (Fuzzy Rough Set Session Identification and Feature Selection). FRS-SIFS first identifies user sessions using fuzzy rough set clustering based on string similarity measures. It then determines important features for recognizing web users' behavioral patterns using fuzzy rough set classification. FRS-SIFS labels the sessions using a novel precise heuristic method based on four phases. Moreover, two different feature selection methods are used which include fuzzy rough set quick reduction algorithm and a novel wrapper feature selection method. Finally, the multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II (non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II) is used to select the optimal set of features. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on a real-world dataset by the tenfold cross-validation method. The results of the experiments have been compared with state-of-the-art methods which show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of recall, precision, and F1 measures.

AB Generally, face detection or prediction and tracking technology is the most critical research direction for target tracking and identifying criminal activities. However, crime detection in a surveillance system is complex to use. Moreover, preprocessing layer takes more time and needs to get pure-quality data. This research designed a novel, Crow Search-based Recurrent Neural Scheme to enhance the prediction performance of occlusion faces and improve classification results. Thus, the developed model was implemented in the Python tool, and the online COFW dataset was collected and trained for the system. Furthermore, enhance the performance of prediction accuracy and classify the person accurately by using Crow search fitness. Thus, the designed optimization technique tracks and searches the person's location and predicts the occlusion faces using labels. Finally, developed model experimental outcomes show better performance in predicting the occlusion faces, and the attained results are validated with prevailing models. The designed model gained 98.75% accuracy, 99% recall, and 98.56% precision for predicting occlusion faces. It shows the efficiency of the developed model and attains better performance while comparing other models.

AB This Reusability Report revisits a recently developed machine learning method for precision oncology, called 'transfer of cell line response prediction' (TCRP). Emily So et al. confirm the reproducibility of the previously reported results in drug-response prediction and also test the reusability of the method on new case studies with clinical relevance.
   Machine learning and artificial intelligence methods are increasingly being used in personalized medicine, including precision oncology. Ma et al. (Nature Cancer 2021) have developed a new method called 'transfer of cell line response prediction' (TCRP) to train predictors of drug response in cancer cell lines and optimize their performance in higher complex cancer model systems via few-shot learning. TCRP has been presented as a successful modelling approach in multiple case studies. Given the importance of this approach for assisting clinicians in their treatment decision processes, we sought to independently reproduce the authors' findings and improve the reusability of TCRP in new case studies, including validation in clinical-trial datasets-a high bar for drug-response prediction. Our reproducibility results, while not reaching the same level of superiority as those of the original authors, were able to confirm the superiority of TCRP in the original clinical context. Our reusability results indicate that, in the majority of novel clinical contexts, TCRP remains the superior method for predicting response for both preclinical and clinical settings. Our results thus support the superiority of TCRP over established statistical and machine learning approaches in preclinical and clinical settings. We also developed new resources to increase the reusability of the TCRP model for future improvements and validation studies.

AB Big data come with new challenges for network intrusion detection as it provides large-scale data with a variety of sophisticated attacks (e.g., malware, advanced persistent threats APTs, zero-day attacks). For that, the demand for new tools and approaches specialized in big data analytics is increasing. In addition, The false alarm rate of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) is a major concern. The majority of the existing methods for large-scale network intrusion detection reach a high false-positive rate (FPR) due to the class imbalance of large-scale intrusion datasets, which can affect the network. Subsequently, the critical challenge is to reduce FPR with the lowest decrease in true-positive rate (TPR) to retain detection quality at a feasible level. To face up to these challenges, we have proposed a new network intrusion detection system for big network intrusion based on the negative selection principle and big data frameworks. One of the promising negative selection methods of the artificial immune system (AIS) for network intrusion detection is the variable-sized detector algorithm. Unfortunately, this algorithm cannot analyze big datasets, because the generation of the radius of each detector is related to the self-space, and it will be more complex when the self-space is too big. Furthermore, the search for new detectors is done randomly, and the generated detectors do not have maximum coverage of the self and non-self-space. To confront the shortcoming of this algorithm, we have proposed an extended V-detector algorithm that is built using clonal selection and fuzzy rules, and it is implemented on Apache Spark. The proposed algorithm is scalable and more efficient when applied to large-scale imbalanced datasets. The proposed framework is implemented in a fully distributed cluster of Apache Spark workers and evaluated on the KDDcup99 benchmark dataset, on a large up-to-date dataset CICIDS2017, and on large-scale synthetic datasets. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves high detection accuracy of 0.9984 and 0.9994 and very low positive rates of 0.0002 and 0.0001 with comparable detection rates for the KDDcup99 dataset and the imbalanced dataset CICIDS2017, respectively. Moreover, it improves the scalability and execution time, key for big intrusion detection analysis in real-time.

AB Humans are able to achieve good teamwork through collaboration, since the contributions of the actions from human team members are properly understood by each individual. Therefore, reasonable credit assignment is crucial for multi-agent cooperation. Although existing work uses value decomposition algorithms to mitigate the credit assignment problem, since they decompose the global value function at multi-agents' local value function level, the overall evaluation of the value function can easily lead to approximation errors. Moreover, such strategies are vulnerable to sparse reward scenarios. In this paper, we propose to use expert demonstrations to guide the team reward decomposition at each time step, rather than value decomposition. The proposed method computes the reward ratio of each agent according to the similarity between the state-action pair of the agent and the expert demonstrations. In addition, under this setting, each agent can independently train its value function and evaluate its behavior, which makes the algorithm highly robust to team rewards. Moreover, the proposed method constrains the policy to collect data with similar distribution to the expert data during the exploration, which makes policy update more robust. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our proposed method in various MARL environments, the results show that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in most scenarios; our method is robust to various reward functions; and the trajectories by our policy is closer to that of the expert policy.

AB Short text clustering is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. Different from traditional documents, short texts are ambiguous and sparse due to their short form and the lack of recurrence in word usage from one text to another, making it very challenging to apply conventional machine learning algorithms directly. In this article, we propose two novel approaches for short texts clustering: collapsed Gibbs sampling infinite generalized Dirichlet multinomial mixture model infinite GSGDMM) and collapsed Gibbs sampling infinite Beta-Liouville multinomial mixture model (infinite GSBLMM). We adopt two flexible and practical priors to the multinomial distribution where in the first one the generalized Dirichlet distribution is integrated, while the second one is based on the Beta-Liouville distribution. We evaluate the proposed approaches on two famous benchmark datasets, namely, Google News and Tweet. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our models compared to basic approaches that use Dirichlet priors. We further propose to improve the performance of our methods with an online clustering procedure. We also evaluate the performance of our methods for the outlier detection task, in which we achieve accurate results.

AB Often most software development doesn't start from scratch but applies previously developed artifacts. These reusable artifacts are involved in various phases of the software life cycle, ranging from requirements to maintenance. Software design as the high level of software development process has an important impact on the following stages, so its reuse is gaining more and more attention. Unified modeling language (UML) class diagram as a modeling tool has become a de facto standard of software design, and thus its reuse also becomes a concern accordingly. So far, the related research on the reuse of UML class diagrams has focused on matching and retrieval. As a large number of class diagrams enter the repository for reuse, classification has become an essential task. The classification is divided into unsupervised classification (also known as clustering) and supervised classification. In our previous work, we discussed the clustering of UML class diagrams. In this paper, we focus on only the supervised classification of UML class diagrams and propose a supervised classification method. A novel ensemble classifier F-KNB combining both dependent and independent construction ideas is built. The similarity of class diagrams is described, in which the semantic, structural and hybrid matching is defined, respectively. The extracted feature elements are used in base classifiers F-KNN and F-NBs that are constructed based on improved K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) and Naive Bayes (NB), respectively. A series of experimental results show that the proposed ensemble classifier F-KNB shows a good classification quality and efficiency under the condition of variable size and distribution of training samples.

AB Optimization is a common phenomenon that we encounter in our daily routine, which involves selecting the best option from a set of alternatives. A lot of algorithms have been developed, including metaheuristics algorithms, which aim to find solutions close to optimal to solve optimization problems. Many metaheuristic algorithms have been inspired by the behavior of natural phenomena, animals, and biological sciences. This paper proposes a novel nature-based metaheuristic optimization algorithm called Adaptive Fox Optimization (AFOX) Algorithm, which is inspired by the hunting behavior of foxes. The proposed algorithm enhances the FOX algorithm by balancing the exploration and exploitation phases, speeding up convergence to the global solution, and avoiding local optima. The efficacy of the AFOX algorithm was tested on eight classical benchmark functions, the functions of CEC2018, and the functions of the CEC2019 Benchmarks. Moreover, AFOX was applied to solve real-world optimization problems, such as prediction and engineering design problems, and compared with a wide range of metaheuristic algorithms such as variant versions of FOX, the Dragon-Fly Algorithm, particle swarm optimization, Fitness Dependent Optimizer, Grey Wolf Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm, Chimp Optimization Algorithm, Butterfly Optimization Algorithm, and Genetic Algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AFOX algorithm in finding optimal solutions with higher accuracy and faster convergence. Thus, the AFOX algorithm is deemed to be highly efficient in solving real-world optimization problems with accuracy and speed.

AB The foundations of AI design discourse are worth analyzing. Here, attention is paid to the nature of theory languages used in designing new AI technologies because the limits of these languages can clarify some fundamental questions in the development of AI. We discuss three types of theory language used in designing AI products: formal, computational, and natural. Formal languages, such as mathematics, logic, and programming languages, have fixed meanings and no actual-world semantics. They are context- and practically content-free. Computational languages use terms referring to the actual world, i.e., to entities, events, and thoughts. Thus, computational languages have actual-world references and semantics. They are thus no longer context- or content-free. However, computational languages always have fixed meanings and, for this reason, limited domains of reference. Finally, unlike formal and computational languages, natural languages are creative, dynamic, and productive. Consequently, they can refer to an unlimited number of objects and their attributes in an unlimited number of domains. The differences between the three theory languages enable us to reflect on the traditional problems of strong and weak AI.

AB Skeleton-based neural networks have been considered a focus for human action recognition (HAR). It is noteworthy that the existing skeleton-based methods are not capable of combining the spatial and temporal features reasonably to derive more effective high-level representations, and it continues to be a challenging task of learning and representing the skeleton action discriminatively. In this study, a novel two-stream spatiotemporal network (TSTN) is proposed, which is capable of processing the spatial and temporal features respectively and collectively to achieve a better representation and understanding of human action. The temporal branch stacks three gate recurrent unit (GRU) blocks in a new architecture to encode the temporal correlations from different aspects of human action, achieving high-level temporal semantic feature expressions. The spatial branch encodes the spatial features with multi-stacked graph convolutional network (GCN) blocks. Self-attention mechanisms incorporated with the graph structure of the skeleton are explored to add weight influence and structural hints to further enhance the performance. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model in skeleton action recognition; the model reaches state-of-the-art on specific datasets.

AB In the contemporary context, both production and consumption of energy, being concepts intertwined through a condition of synchronicity, are pivotal for the orderly functioning of society, with their management being a building block in maintaining regularity. Hence, the pursuit to develop reliable computational tools for modeling such serial and time-dependent phenomena becomes similarly crucial. This paper investigates the use of ensemble learners for medium-term forecasting of the Greek energy system load using additional information from injected energy production from various sources. Through an extensive experimental process, over 435 regression schemes and 64 different modifications of the feature inputs were tested over five different prediction time frames, creating comparative rankings regarding two case studies: one related to methods and the other to feature setups. Evaluations according to six widely used metrics indicate an aggregate but clear dominance of a specific efficient and low-cost ensemble layout. In particular, an ensemble method that incorporates the orthogonal matching pursuit together with the Huber regressor according to an averaged combinatorial scheme is proposed. Moreover, it is shown that the use of multivariate setups improves the derived predictions.

AB The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is a feedforward artificial neural network employing radial basis functions as activation functions in the hidden layer. The output of the RBFNN is a linear combination of the outputs from the hidden layer. This paper present a Mixed Radial Basis Function Neural Network (MRBFNN) training using Genetic Algorithm (GA). The choice of the type of Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) utilized in each hidden layer neuron has a significant impact on convergence, interpolation and performance. In this work, the authors are introducing a new approach to optimizing the choice of radial basis functions, centers, radius and weights of the output layer. We model in terms of mixed-variable optimization problems with linear constraints. To solve this model we will use an approach based on the genetic algorithm, allows us to determine the types of RBF to use in the hidden layer and the optimal weight of the output layer which gives us a good generalization. The results numerically demonstrate the performance of the theoretic results presented in this paper, as well as the benefits of the new modeling.

AB Anticipatory thinking is the act of identifying problems that may arise in the future, and preparing for them in order to mitigate the risk of (or opportunity for) positive or negative impacts occurring. In this paper, we argue that a critical underlying process of anticipatory thinking is cognitive priming, where one's current thoughts influence the next without conscious intention. We make this argument in terms of two aspects of human cognition that are related to anticipatory thinking: context and creativity. We then use the parallels between context, creativity, and anticipatory thinking to support our belief that cognitive priming plays a key role in various aspects of anticipatory thinking. As part of this analysis, we also discuss its broader implications, including how it can be used to improve computational systems that do anticipatory thinking, as well as how it can be leveraged to improve anticipatory thinking in people.

DE Visual servoing; Reward inference; Probabilistic temporal ranking
ID ROBOT
AB Informative path-planning is a well established approach to visual-servoing and active viewpoint selection in robotics, but typically assumes that a suitable cost function or goal state is known. This work considers the inverse problem, where the goal of the task is unknown, and a reward function needs to be inferred from exploratory example demonstrations provided by a demonstrator, for use in a downstream informative path-planning policy. Unfortunately, many existing reward inference strategies are unsuited to this class of problems, due to the exploratory nature of the demonstrations. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to cope with the class of problems where these sub-optimal, exploratory demonstrations occur. We hypothesise that, in tasks which require discovery, successive states of any demonstration are progressively more likely to be associated with a higher reward, and use this hypothesis to generate time-based binary comparison outcomes and infer reward functions that support these ranks, under a probabilistic generative model. We formalise this probabilistic temporal ranking approach and show that it improves upon existing approaches to perform reward inference for autonomous ultrasound scanning, a novel application of learning from demonstration in medical imaging while also being of value across a broad range of goal-oriented learning from demonstration tasks.

DT Article; Early Access

AB Temporal information in event streams plays a critical role in event-based video frame interpolation as it provides temporal context cues complementary to images. Most previous event-based methods first transform the unstructured event data to structured data formats through voxelisation, and then employ advanced CNNs to extract temporal information. However, voxelisation inevitably leads to information loss, and processing the sparse voxels introduces severe computation redundancy. To address these limitations, this study proposes a point-image fusion network (PIFNet). In our PIFNet, rich temporal information from the events can be directly extracted at the point level. Then, a fusion module is designed to fuse complementary cues from both points and images for frame interpolation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our PIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

TI STMT: Spatio-temporal memory transformer for multi-object tracking

DT Article
DE Deep learning; Multi-object tracking; Transformer; Memory;
   Spatio-temporal
AB Typically, modern online Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) methods first obtain the detected objects in each frame and then establish associations between them in successive frames. However, it is difficult to obtain high-quality trajectories when camera motion, fast motion, and occlusion challenges occur. To address these problems, this paper proposes a transformer-based MOT system named Spatio-Temporal Memory Transformer (STMT), which focuses on time and history information. The proposed STMT consists of a Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Module (STEM) that uses 3D convolution to model the spatial and temporal interactions of objects and obtains rich features in spatio-temporal information. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Memory (DSTM) is presented to associate detections with tracklets and contains three units: an Identity Aggregation Module (IAM), a Linear Dynamic Encoder (LD-Encoder) and a memory Decoder (Decoder). The IAM utilizes the geometric changes of objects to reduce the impact of deformation on tracking performance, the LD-Encoder is used to obtain the dependency between objects, and the Decoder generates appearance similarity scores. Furthermore, a Score Fusion Equilibrium Strategy (SFES) is employed to balance the similarity and position distance fusion scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed STMT approach is generally superior to the state-of-the-art trackers on the MOT16 and MOT17 benchmarks.

AB Recent works have demonstrated the superiority of supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in learning hierarchical representations from time series data for successful classification. These meth-ods require sufficiently large labeled data for stable learning, however acquiring high-quality labeled time series data can be costly and potentially infeasible. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved great success in enhancing unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, it remains unclear how effectively GANs can serve as a general-purpose solution to learn representations for time series recognition, i.e., classification and clustering. The above considerations inspire us to introduce a Time-series Convolutional GAN (TCGAN). TCGAN learns by playing an adversarial game between two one-dimensional CNNs (i.e., a generator and a discriminator) in the absence of label information. Parts of the trained TCGAN are then reused to construct a representation encoder to empower linear recognition methods. We conducted comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that TCGAN is faster and more accurate than existing time-series GANs. The learned representations enable simple classification and clustering methods to achieve superior and stable performance. Furthermore, TCGAN retains high efficacy in scenarios with few-labeled and imbalanced-labeled data. Our work provides a promising path to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled time series data. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Video captioning is a computer vision task that generates a natural language description for a video. In this paper, we propose a multimodal attention-based transformer using the keyframe features, object features, and semantic keyword embedding features of a video. The Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used to extract keyframes from a video. We also detect the unique objects from the extracted keyframes. The features from the keyframes and the objects detected in the keyframes are extracted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the encoder, we use a bimodal attention block to apply two-way cross-attention between the keyframe features and the object features. In the decoder, we combine the features of the words generated up to the previous time step, the semantic keyword embedding features, and the encoder features using a tri-modal attention block. This allows the decoder to choose the multimodal features dynamically to generate the next word in the description. We evaluated the proposed approach using the MSVD, MSR-VTT, and Charades datasets and observed that the proposed model provides better performance than other state-of-the-art models.

However, as the boundary of positive and negative samples, gamma may have a continuous property and be complementary to other parameters. The high consistency between gamma and the learnable parameter with respect to their attributes means that choosing gamma as a hyperparameter is probably not a good choice. To better explore the characteristics of gamma, we propose a multi-iterated parameterized scheme to convert gamma from a hyperparameter to a normal parameter. Two concrete implementation methods, the macro parametrized method and the micro parameterized method, are provided to achieve this conversion. The conversion for gamma can reduce dependency on expert knowledge in the gamma setting and can allow successors to become involved in the recent framework quickly. Experimental results on TransE, RotatE and LineaRE show that the proposed scheme and methods can achieve approximate or better results when compared with those of the original method. A series of experimental analyses further explore the characteristics and illustrate the availability of the proposed parameterized scheme and methods.

ID PREDICTION
AB Enabling diabetic patients to predict their Blood Glucose Levels (BGL) is a crucial aspect of managing their metabolic condition, as it allows them to take appropriate measures to avoid hypo or hyperglycemia. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have made this possible, and this paper evaluates and compares the performance of five distinct ML/DL models including: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Gated Reccurent Unit (GRU) and Deep Belief Network (DBN) for forecasting BGL, by applying two different forecasting methods, namely One Step Ahead (OSF) and Multi-Step Ahead (MSF) comprising five different variants. The performance is evaluated based on four metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Magnitude Relative Error (MMRE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Predictive Level (PRED). Additionally, the statistical significance of the regressors was evaluated using the Scott-Knott (SK) test, while the Borda Count (BC) voting system was employed to rank them. The results indicate that the best performance was achieved with OSF using GRU. Furthermore, the effectiveness of an MSF strategy depends on the ML/DL technique used, and the best combinations were DBN with DirRec, DBN with Recursive, SVR with Recursive and SVR with DirRec. Additionally, DirRec was found to be the best strategy, as it consistently ranked first regardless of the ML/DL technique used.

   re-identification
ID NETWORK
AB Attribute-image person re-identification (AIPR) is a cross-modal retrieval task that searches person images who meet a list of attributes. Due to large modal gaps between attributes and images, current AIPR methods generally depend on cross-modal feature alignment, but they do not pay enough attention to similarity metric jitters among varying modal configurations (i.e., attribute probe vs. image gallery, image probe vs. attribute gallery, image probe vs. image gallery, and attribute probe vs. attribute gallery). In this paper, we propose a modal-consistent metric learning (MCML) method that stably measures comprehensive similarities between attributes and images. Our MCML is with favorable properties that differ in two significant ways from previous methods. First, MCML provides a complete multi-modal triplet (CMMT) loss function that pulls the distance between the farthest positive pair as close as possible while pushing the distance between the nearest negative pair as far as possible, independent of their modalities. Second, MCML develops a modal-consistent matching regularization (MCMR) to reduce the diversity of matching matrices and guide consistent matching behaviors on varying modal configurations. Therefore, our MCML integrates the CMMT loss function and MCMR, requiring no complex cross-modal feature alignments. Theoretically, we offer the generalization bound to establish the stability of our MCML model by applying on-average stability. Experimentally, extensive results on PETA and Market-1501 datasets show that the proposed MCML is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Multi-task visual perception has a wide range of applications in scene understanding such as autonomous driving. In this work, we devise an efficient unified framework to solve multiple common perception tasks, including instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, monocular 3D detection, and depth estimation. Simply sharing the same visual feature representations for these tasks impairs the performance of tasks, while independent task-specific feature extractors lead to parameter redundancy and latency. Thus, we design two feature-merge branches to learn feature basis, which can be useful to, and thus shared by, multiple perception tasks. Then, each task takes the corresponding feature basis as the input of the prediction task head to fulfill a specific task. In particular, one feature merge branch is designed for instance-level recognition the other for dense predictions. To enhance inter-branch communication, the instance branch passes pixel-wise spatial information of each instance to the dense branch using efficient dynamic convolution weighting. Moreover, a simple but effective dynamic routing mechanism is proposed to isolate task-specific features and leverage common properties among tasks. Our proposed framework, termed D2BNet, demonstrates a unique approach to parameter-efficient predictions for multi-task perception. In addition, as tasks benefit from co-training with each other, our solution achieves on par results on partially labeled settings on nuScenes and outperforms previous works for 3D detection and depth estimation on the Cityscapes dataset with full supervision.

AB Because logistics companies usually have multiple depots to serve their many dispersed customers, multi-depot vehicle routing problem (MDVRP) has gained significant research attention. To solve an MDVRP model, this paper develops a hybrid ant colony optimization based on a polygonal circumcenter (BPC-HACO). Furthermore, because ACO has been found to fall easily into the local optimum, simulated annealing and three local optimization operations are introduced to encourage the ACO to improve the algorithm's optimization ability. Finally, MDVRP benchmarks and data sets of other papers are employed to verify the effectiveness of the BPC-HACO in solving MDVRP (In 23 instances, BPC-HACO finds 14 BSKs, and 3 results are better than the BSKs), MDVRP with distance constraints (Compared to other papers, the route length is reduced by an average of 17.94%) and dynamic MDVRP (In 10 instances, BPC-HACO finds 3 BSKs, and 2 results are better than the BSKs). Finally, fitness landscape analysis has been applied to analyze the structural features of MDVRP to choose the most appropriate algorithm for MDVRP.

AB Sentiment analysis (SA) is the study of human perception in any subject of practice. It retrieves data from datasets using natural language processing (NLP) methodologies and algorithms that are either regulation-based, blended, or rely on machine learning approaches. SA is garnering fame for its capacity to fit in a large chunk of data with user evaluations, uncover a trend, and come to a consensus derived from real facts rather than hypotheses established on a limited number of observations. The flexible nature of sentiment gathering has helped in playing a critical role in both commercial and research applications in the last few years. This study presents new sentiment analysis models based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for both labeled and unlabeled datasets. The labeled datasets using supervised learning are modeled in a hybrid architecture of fine-tuned BERT and interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. The inclusion of interval Type-2 fuzzy logic for handling reluctance or inaccuracy in data shows commendable results for the labeled datasets. For the prediction of sentiments in unlabeled datasets, they are embedded through a BERT tokenizer with the help of a threshold and activation functions. The coupling of a multi-layer perceptron with the BERT parser substantially decreases the time and complexity compared to supervised learning. Both the models have been implemented on multiple datasets and have outperformed existing state-of-the-art techniques in this field.

AB In this study, the DiagCovidPNA method is proposed to aid in diagnosing and differentiating COVID-19 disease and viral and bacterial pneumonia (PNA) from chest X-ray (CXR) images. The proposed method is based on application-specific convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. DiagCovidPNA is a four-class (i.e., COVID-19, normal lung, bacterial PNA, and viral PNA) diagnostic method that is offered in two different systems: (1) DiagCovidPNA and (2) Hybrid DiagCovidPNA. In the first system, a single CNN is used to classify the input images into four classes. In the second system, to further differentiate bacterial and viral PNAs more, the input images are classified into four classes using a combination of a three-class (i.e., COVID-19, normal lung, PNA) CNN-based classifier and a two-class (i.e., bacterial PNA and viral PNA) CNN-based classifier. A comprehensive labeled database of CXR images for training and testing purposes has been compiled using two sources of available images. In addition, the transfer learning method is applied to reduce the issue of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare both systems to existing methods. According to the results, the diagnostic accuracy of DiagCovidPNA and Hybrid DiagCovidPNA is 95% and 97.50%, respectively. Consequently, Hybrid DiagCovidPNA improves accuracy by approximately 8% compared to other deep learning-based methods with a same structure and approximately 3% compared to the parallel transfer deep learning-based method. All DiagCovidPNA implementation source codes and the compiled CXR database are publicly available to the research community.

AB Recently, several fluidlike, shape-adaptable magnetic microrobots have been developed to overcome the drawbacks posed by the rigid structure of traditional magnetic microrobots. However, most of their control systems rely on permanent magnet-based systems, which are unfeasible for large-scale environments, such as in vivo applications. Herein, an electromagnetic system comprising orthogonal pairs of coils is used to generate global magnetic fields, that is, magnetic fields that are applied equally to large volumes, for the multimodal locomotion of ferrofluidic robots composed of magnetic micro-/nanoparticles. Three main magnetic field configurations, with their respective locomotion mechanisms, are explored: uniform rotating fields for droplet fission-fusion motions and locomotion; magnetic trapping point-based locomotion for single- and collective-droplet manipulation; and field-free region-based dragging locomotion and selective droplet control. The effectiveness of the proposed multimodal locomotion mechanisms and potential applications are experimentally demonstrated in minichannels through selective mixing, targeted delivery, and optimized magnetic heating applications. These locomotion mechanisms using global fields enable the use of fluidlike magnetic microrobots in large-volume applications.

AB Resistance spot welding is an important process in the production of body-in-white. The quality of the welded nugget affects the safety performance of the whole vehicle. Currently, the quality of the welded nugget is mainly inspected manually, which is labor-intensive and inefficient. Therefore, this paper explores a new method to automatically and efficiently detect the quality of welded nugget by analyzing the vibration excitation response signal of the welded joint. In response to the characteristics of large volume, significant noise, and small discriminability of raw signals, we constructed a deep learning model named Real Spatial-temporal Attention Denoising Network (RSTADN), which consists of a denoising module, spatial-temporal attention modules, and multiple residual modules. The denoising module uses global absolute average pooling (GAAP) to maximize the retention of the original signal characteristics while aggregating global information from each channel. It generates appropriate soft thresholds to eliminate noise and enhance the feature recognition ability of the model. The spatial-temporal attention modules delve into the spatiotemporal correlation features of the signal from different perspectives, including real spatial scale, short-term dependency, and global temporal interaction, to enhance the model's feature extraction ability. Multiple residual modules further extract signal features to achieve precise alignment between features and nugget quality states. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of RSTADN in the task of detecting the quality of welded nugget reaches as high as 94.35%, which is at least 1.31% higher than that of existing models.

AB The introduction of the tethered DROP-IN gamma probe has enabled targeted robot-assisted radioguided prostate cancer (PCa) resection of pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive lesions. While both procedures use Tc-99m-isotopes, the two vary in signal and background intensity. To understand how the different levels of image guidance impact surgical decision-making, computer-vision algorithms are used to extract the DROP-IN probe kinematic form clinical videos. 44 PCa patients undergo SLN (25) and PSMA-targeted (19) resections. PSMA-PET/CT and SPECT/CT create preoperative roadmaps, and intraoperative probe signal intensities are recorded. Using neural network-based software, probe trajectories are extracted from videos to extract multiparametric kinematics and generate decision-making and dexterity scores. PSMA-targeted resections yield significantly lower nodal signal intensities in preoperative SPECT-CT scans (three-fold; p = 0.01), intraoperative probe readouts (eight-fold; p < 0.001), and signal-to-background ratios (SBR; two-fold; p < 0.001). Kinematics assessment reveal that the challenges encounter during PSMA-targeted procedures converted to longer target identification times and increase in probe pick-ups (both five-fold; p < 0.001). This results in a fourfold reduction in the decision-making score (p < 0.001). Reduced signal intensities and intraoperative SBR values negatively affect the impact that image-guided surgery strategies have on the surgical decision-making process.

AB A shape estimation method that utilizes two sensing modalities of a customized fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor and a commercial air pressure sensor for a pneumatically driven soft finger with an extensive bending angle range based on an artificial neural network model is proposed. The proposed FBG sensor utilizes two tiny nitinol rods as a backbone to attach the long-grating FBG element fiber, enabling high strain transfer, shape sensing for large bending deformation, and preventing chirping failure and fiber sliding when bending. Its distal end is set free to slide and synchronizes with the extended length and reflects shapes for large bending deformation (up to 320 & DEG; with a linearity of 99.96%), while its proximal end is fixed. The small packaged sensor unit enables modular design, easy assembly, and high repeatability with negligible effects on the soft finger's bending performances. The artificial neural network model is utilized to process the input of two sensing modalities, reducing errors from material nonlinearity, fabrication, and assembly of soft fingers while improving shape estimation's accuracy and transferability with average errors of 0.90 mm (0.69%) and 1.55 mm (1.19%) for whole shape and distal end position, respectively. Preliminary experiments also verify the potential for pressing force prediction and hardness recognition.

ID BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION
AB This study uses different feature selection methods in the field of business failure prediction and tests the capability of Genetic Programming (GP) as an appropriate classifier in this field. The prediction models categorize the insolvency/non-insolvency of a firm one year in advance from a large set of financial ratios. Different selection strategies based on two evolutionary algorithms were used to reduce the dimensionality of the financial features considered. The first method considers the combination between the global search provided by an evolutionary algorithm (differential evolution) with a simple classifier, together with the possible use of classical filters in a first step of feature selection. Secondly, genetic programming is used as a feature selector. In addition, these selection approaches will be compared when GP is used exclusively as a classifier. The results show that, when using GP as a classifier method, the proposed selection method with GP stands out from the rest. Moreover, the use of GP as a classifier improves the results with respect to other classifier methods. This shows an added value to the use of GP in this field, in addition to the interpretability of GP prediction models.

AB One of the leading causes of mortality for women worldwide, both in developing and developed economies, is breast cancer. The gold standard for diagnosing cancer is still histological diagnosis, despite major advances in medical understanding. Admittedly, due to the sophistication of histopathology images and the significant increase in workload, this process takes a long time. Therefore, this field requires the development of automated and precise histopathology image analysis tools. Using deep learning, we proposed a system for denoising, detecting, and classifying breast cancer using deep learning architectures that are designed to solve certain related problems. CNN-based architectures are used to extract features from images, which are then put into a fully connected layer for the classification of malignant and benign cells, as well as their subclasses, in the suggested framework. The effectiveness of the suggested framework is evaluated through experiments leveraging accepted benchmark data sets. We achieve an accuracy of 94% and an F1 score of more than 90%.

AB As a friendly tool, the soft gripper can be used directly for grasping vulnerable objects in underwater environments. These tasks are generally performed by teleoperation based on the visual feedback, rather than the soft actuators' sensing information. However, vision sensors' function may be restricted in some complex underwater environments with poor visibility and narrow spaces. This will greatly reduce the efficiency of the underwater operations. Therefore, soft actuators strongly require an organism-like perception system to sense environmental stimuli and can be applied to complex underwater environments. To address the problem, a multidirectional external perception soft actuator based on two flexible optical waveguide sensors is developed and machine learning methods are utilized to build its perceptual model herein. The experimental results indicate that the soft actuator can recognize 12 contact positions based on the sensing model, and the identifying accuracy is up to 99.82%. Additionally, according to the contact location feedback, teleoperation can be more efficiently completed in unknown underwater environments.

AB Herein, a real-time, fast, tightly coupled simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system is proposed. The deep neural network is used to segment the point cloud semantically to construct the point cloud semantic map descriptor, and the global navigation satellite system real-time kinematic position is used to detect the loop closure. Finally, a factor-graph model is used for global optimization. The working principle of the SLAM system is introduced in detail, including the construction of the factor graph, the generation of the point cloud semantic graph descriptor, the generation of the ring graph, the loop-closure detection process, and the global optimization. Indoor and outdoor experiments are conducted to validate the performance of overall trajectory estimation and loop-closure detection. Compared to traditional methods, the proposed method offers improved accuracy and real-time performance in trajectory estimation. It effectively addresses issues such as limited feature constraints, large computational consumption, and subpar real-time performance, allowing for quick and accurate loop-closure detection. Moreover, the method demonstrates a time consumption reduction of two-thirds compared to traditional approaches while exhibiting superior overall loop-closure detection performance.

DE elephant trunk tip; granular materials; soft gripper; transport strategy
AB Manipulating granular materials is a crucial function of robotic grippers. However, the existing approaches always suffer from low efficiency when dealing with large quantities of dispersed granules. To overcome this challenge, inspiration is drawn from an African elephant (Loxodonta Africana), which can employ both fingertip extensions on the trunk tip to efficiently grasp dispersed granular food all at once by mediating state transition of granules. Herein, this bio-inspired intelligent strategy is integrated into a soft pneumatic gripper for transporting dispersed granules. To evaluate the critical actuation pressures while grasping granules, a library is constructed experimentally, and the effects of the initial relative height and relative lifting speed on the grasping success rate are examined. It is indicated in the experimental results that this trunk-inspired robotic strategy leads to a success rate of over 90% and saves & AP;50% duration of manipulation compared to the individual gripping fashion. Herein, new insights may be offered in this study into a novel manipulation strategy for efficiently transporting dispersed granular materials.

AB Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) requires precise selection of a single sperm cell in a dish to be injected into an oocyte. This task is challenging due to high sperm velocity, collision with other sperm cells, and changes in the imaging focus. Herein, a new model is proposed, which is based on a multilayer long short-term memory (LSTM) network combined with linear extrapolation calculation, for predicting the future location of individual sperm cells based on their previous paths. The model is trained with a unique loss function, constructed from the predicted location and trajectory, and results in low mean location error predictions. The results are based on comparing different input sequences length, number of time frames ahead, and motility parameters of sperm cells. This model can provide faster and more accurate sperm motility predictions, better tracking, and aid automatic sperm capturing technologies.

AB We present DITAN, a novel unsupervised domain-agnostic framework for detecting and interpreting temporal-based anomalies. It is based on an encoder-decoder architecture with both implicit/explicit attention and adjustable layers/units for predicting normality as regular patterns in sequential data. A two stage thresholding methodology with built-in pruning is used to detect anomalies, while root cause and similarities are interpreted in data and units space. Our approach is designed to intersect the 9 fundamental characteristics extracted from the union of related works. We demonstrate the DITAN modules on real-world datasets of 6 multivariate time series contaminated by point and contextual temporal-based anomalies at a varying duration. Experiments show a dominant predictability power of DITAN against the originally proposed models. DITAN is able to determine critical regions and thus identify anomalous events similarly well. Informative similarities between anomalous records are interpreted, since almost all similarities in units space are also verified in data space. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been used to examine age-related neuroanatomical changes in the human brain. In the present work, a pre-trained deep learning model and an ensemble deep random vector functional link (edRVFL) classifier have been used to create a brain age classification framework from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. A total of 155 MRI scans of the brain are obtained from the open-access OpenNeuro database and categorized into three age groups (3-5 years old, 7-12 years old, and 18-40 years old). To visualize the age connection across different brain regions, all MRI scans are first segmented into Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM), and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). The ResNet-50 network is used to extract features from MRI images, while the edRVFL network is used to classify the retrieved features. Classification accuracy for GM, WM, CSF, and whole brain images are 96.11%, 98.33%, 93.33%, and 94.00%, respectively, using the edRVFL classifier. Region-wise analysis has also been done using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE) to analyze the relationship between brain age and brain tissue volumes. According to the findings of the suggested deep model for brain age categorization, and region-wise analysis, alterations in WM volume are strongly linked to brain aging.

AB Financial time series prediction has many applications in economics, but producing profitable strategies certainly has a special place among them, a daunting challenge. Statistical and machine learning techniques are intensively researched in the search for a holy grail of stock markets forecasting. However, it is not clear to prospecting researchers how good those popular models are regarding useful predictions on a real scenario. This paper contributes to that discussion, providing decisive evidences contrary to the use of basic out-of-the-box models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Naive-Bayes (NB). Results consider optimistic and unreal variables often found in literature, as well as a more close-to-real simulation of the models usage. Specifically, current day closing prices direction forecasting results are contrasted with those on next day forecasts. As expected, when forecasting the current day, accuracy is almost perfect. However, when used to forecast next day closing direction, with a strict data separation policy and without direction or snooping bias, ANN, SVM, RF and NB produce results essentially equal to random guessing. The main achieved result is the demonstration of how a machine learning approach would fare in a support decision system for forecasting short-term future market direction, regardless of the level of market development, considering more than 100 securities in a 10 years period. Consequences for algorithmic trading relate to discouraging usage of the considered models as implemented here. On a more abstract sense, this paper presents more evidence to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).

DT Article
DE Shadowed sets; Adaptive division threshold; Semi-supervised learning;
   Images classification; Noisy label
AB Sample selection is a fundamental technique utilized in image classification with noisy labels. A plethora of sample selection approaches published in the literature are based on a small-loss strategy, in which division thresholds are set manually and the correlation between sample losses is ignored. Furthermore, one of the most evident shortcomings of these approaches is that noisy samples with low-quality pseudo-labels can negatively impact the model resulting in poor performance. In this study, a shadowed-sets-based semi-supervised sample selection network called SSS-Net is developed to address these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel technique that combines a loss-similarity-based-clustering method (LSCM) with the shadowed-sets theory to adaptively select clean samples. We then introduce an original high-quality pseudo-label sample reselection (HPSR) strategy, which is designed through the co-training of two networks, to pick the samples with high-quality pseudo-labels. Finally, the selected samples are utilized to further train the network and complete classification. This study presents an automated approach that determines optimal division thresholds to select clean samples adaptively. Furthermore, it improves the current semi-supervised sample selection method by effectively utilizing noisy samples. The suitability and promising performance of the proposed approach are supported through experimental studies using five real-world datasets. Comparative studies involving several state-of-the-art methods are also reported. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SPECTRUM DISORDER
AB The detection of mental disorders through social media has received significant attention. With the growing prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the inherent difficulties in diagnosing adults, researchers have attempted to identify undiagnosed adults. Previous studies have primarily concentrated on analyzing ASD characteristics rather than directly detecting ASD. The current study aims to propose a novel framework to assist in identifying the "lost generation"of ASD adults using their social media posts. Combining traditional and deep learning methods makes it possible to model complex aspects of ASD diagnostic characteristics, which have been relatively overlooked in previous studies. To accomplish this, specific formalizations for users' patterns of interest as a main ASD diagnostic characteristic are proposed first. The latent linguistic and semantic features of ASD users' postings are then modeled using deep and transformer-based language models. Finally, all these different aspects are considered together to train a detection model by employing the multi-view learning approach. The experiments show that the feature of idiosyncratic interests has more discriminative power than limited and repetitive interests. The results also indicate that the early fusion of interest-related features along with deep linguistic features outperforms the other examined feature combinations. Additionally, the proposed 'if - iuf' fusion model demonstrates improved performance in capturing patterns of interests, compared to baselines. These findings suggest the potential application of the proposed framework towards indirectly identifying ASD users on social media, as evidenced by achieving precision and recall rates of 85% and 82% respectively on the used sampled dataset. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent studies have made remarkable progress on 3D human motion prediction by describing motion with kinematic knowledge. However, kinematics only considers the 3D positions or rotations of human skeletons, failing to reveal the physical characteristics of human motion. Motion dynamics reflects the forces between joints, explicitly encoding the skeleton topology, whereas rarely exploited in motion pre-diction. In this paper, we propose the Kinematic and Dynamic coupled transFormer (KD-Former), which incorporates dynamics with kinematics, to learn powerful features for high-fidelity motion prediction. Specifically, We first formulate a reduced-order dynamic model of human body to calculate the forces of all joints. Then we construct a non-autoregressive encoder-decoder framework based on the transformer structure. The encoder involves a kinematic encoder and a dynamic encoder, which are respectively re-sponsible for extracting the kinematic and dynamic features for given history sequences via a spatial transformer and a temporal transformer. Future query sequences are decoded in parallel in the decoder by leveraging the encoded kinematic and dynamic information of history sequences. Experiments on Hu-man3.6M and CMU MoCap benchmarks verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

AB Predicting the mode of child birth is still remains one of the most complex and challenging tasks in ancient times. Also, there is no such strong methodologies are developed in the conventional works for birth mode prediction. Therefore, the proposed work objects to develop a novel and distinct optimization based machine learning technique for creating the child birth mode prediction system. This framework includes the modules of data imputation, feature selection, classification, and prediction. Initially, the data imputation process is performed to improve the quality of dataset by normalizing the attributes and filling the missed fields. Then, the Multivariate Intensified Mine Blast Optimization (MIMBO) technique is implemented to choose the best set of features by estimating the optimal function. After that, an integrated Naive Bayes - Random Forest (NBRF) technique is developed by incorporating the functions of conventional NB and RF techniques. The novel contribution of this technique, a Bird Mating (BM) optimization technique is used in NBRF classifier for estimating the likelihood parameter to generate the Bayesian rules. The main idea of this paper is to develop a simple as well as efficient automated system with the use of hybrid machine learning model for predicting the mode of child birth. For this purpose, advanced algorithms such as MIMBO based feature selection, and NBRF based classification are implemented in this work. Due to the inclusion of MIMBO and BM optimization techniques, the performance of classifier is greatly improved with low computational burden and increased prediction accuracy. Moreover, the combination of proposed MIMBO-NBRF technique outperforms the existing child birth prediction methods with superior results in terms of average accuracy up to 99 %. In addition, some other parameters are also estimated and compared with the existing techniques for proving the overall superiority of the proposed framework.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things' (IIoT) ongoing growth has provided engineers with a wealth of prospects for improving machine throughput. Due to advancement, owing to the unreliable aspect of the communication route, many business managers still hesitate to operate their equipment online. Security is critical in the IIoT, as certain IIoT devices gather sensory data for vital societal production and living. If the entities are authenticated and confidence is established, the use of the Internet to manage industrial activities can become widely em-braced. The hyperchaotic neuronal coordinated vector-valued key exchange presented in this study enables safe Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) transmission in the IIoT. Key coordination in IIoT is the main issue. As a part of the security protocols for IIoT, this study presented a vector-valued neuronal coordination-based key synchro-nization. How well the ANNs on the collaborating edges synchronize instead of each other's weights is a key fac-tor in neural coordination. Existing techniques take too long to evaluate collaboration, endangering the secrecy of neural synchronization. In addition, minimal studies have been conducted on the reciprocal training of a set of ANNs and the use of a robust PRNG to provide a common input. The suggested approach has a lot of benefits: (1) This research describes the fast evaluation of the coordination of a group of ANNs using a hyperchaotic framework to coordinate ANNs for key agreement. (2) ANNs are coordinated via bidirectional training to spread the neuronal key over a communication link. (3) The measure in which the ANNs have provided similar outputs in previous rounds is used to determine synchronization. (4) The input sequencing for ANN are produced using a collaboratively created 4D, 5D, and 6D hyperchaotic-guided PRNG. (5) The IIoT network's session key is created via a reciprocating neuronal synchronization of vector-valued ANNs. (6) In compared to earlier method-ologies, the proposed technique accelerates the procedure through which participated ANNs achieve perfect synchronization. The suggested approach works better than comparable methods that have been published.

AB It is critical for the management and control of urban rail transit (URT) to be able to predict passenger flow accurately and in real time. Considering that the high-resolution data aggregated by the automatic fare collection (AFC) system is wasted, this paper analyzes the problem of applying a multi-time granularity passenger flow data fusion forecasting process. First, we examine the challenge of constructing a dataset passenger flow data with different time granularities. Thus, an algorithm is proposed for selecting passenger flow datasets with multi-time granularity. Furthermore, a multi-time granularity dense residual network (MulDesLSTM) with a dense residual structure and LSTM (long short-term memory) as the predictor is constructed, inspired by a residual network. Using Mul-DesLSTM, finer-grained passenger flow features can be fused layer by layer while maintaining the accuracy of traditional single-granularity passenger flow predictions. Lastly, Mul-DesLSTM is applied to the URT system of Shanghai, China, and compared with baselines. As a result, proposed Mul-DesLSTM outperforms the baselines with LSTM as a predictor and state-of-the-art model. When the predicted time granularity is 30 min, compared to the single-time granularity LSTM network, the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error can be reduced by 51%, 63%, and 15%, respectively. The results can serve as a reference and basis for the operation and management of URT systems.

AB Process mining focuses on the analysis of event log data to build various process analytical capabilities. Predictive process analytics has emerged as one of such key capabilities and it uses machine learning techniques to construct process prediction models. In recent years, deep neural networks have gained increasing interest in process prediction since they can handle multi-dimensional sequential inputs with minimal information loss. However, they are considered black-box models and existing studies in explaining deep neural network-based process predictions rely on only event-level features for explanation. In this paper, we propose a new approach for generating explanations for process outcome predictions at multiple levels. The approach is underpinned by three different prediction models: a transparent model for generating global explanations based on case -level features, an attention-based deep neural network for generating local explanations based on event-level features, and a novel eXplainable Dual-learning Deep network (XD2-net) for generating local explanations based on case-level features. Using three publicly available datasets, we have tested the applicability of the approach and further examined the multi-level explanations generated by the approach through an elaborate case study. Unlike others, the design of our approach promotes the idea of leveraging the complementary capabilities of different models and utilizing their strengths, rather than focusing on model performance competition. This will contribute towards generating more comprehensive explanations that meet the needs of different end users and purposes in the future.

AB In this paper, an improved artificial potential field (APF) method with predictive state is proposed to reduce the influence of communication delay and physical delay on swarm control. The input threshold is introduced to optimize the problem of excessive APF method control input. The control of large-scale swarm systems is challenging due to the complexity of the communication topology. The second-order communication topology is introduced to simplify the coupling relationship of the system. The collision avoidance and formation maintenance control of the swarm system is realized by setting the collision avoidance and formation maintenance potential functions. Based on the proposed improved artificial potential field method, a new distributed controller for swarm system is designed and its stability is analyzed. Numerical simulations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

AB Recently, research on inference methods has been actively conducted to use language models more effectively for studying natural language understanding. Inference in language models that use bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is performed using classification tokens that convey information from the input sentences. The use of single-token inference method for inference does not involve the hidden state vector that contains relevant connection information between the words, which in turn limits the ability to infer semantic relationships. This study proposes a use all tokens (UAT) method that combines unused tokens to improve inference methods through a single token. The UAT method effectively combines hidden state vectors and ensembles the global information of sentences with the local information between words. When the Stanford natural language inference (SNLI) corpus was solved using DeBERTaV3large, compared to the existing single token inference method, the UAT method improved the precision of the neutral relationship by 4.3% (87.7% vs. 92.0%) and the recall of the entailment and contradiction relationship by an average of 2% (93.5% vs. 95.5%).

TI PreBit-A multimodal model with Twitter FinBERT embeddings for extreme

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Bitcoin; Twitter; NLP; BERT; Price; Prediction
ID STOCK-MARKET PREDICTION; VOLATILITY
AB Bitcoin, with its ever-growing popularity, has demonstrated extreme price volatility since its origin. Extreme price fluctuations have been known to occur due to tweets from Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, and others. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether we can leverage Twitter data to predict these extreme price movements. Existing social media models often take a shortcut and include sentiment extracted from tweets. In this work, however, we want to embed the actual tweets in a domain-informed way, and investigate whether they have an impact. Hence, we propose a multimodal deep learning model for predicting extreme price fluctuations that takes as input candlestick data, prices of a variety of correlated assets, technical indicators, as well as Twitter content. To train the model, a new dataset of 5,000 tweets per day containing the keyword 'Bitcoin' was collected from 2015 to 2021. This dataset, called PreBit, is made available online1, as is our model.2 Our proposed hybrid multimodal model consists of an SVM model based on price data, which is fused with a text-based Convolutional Neural Network. In the text-based model, we use the sentence-level FinBERT embeddings, pretrained on financial lexicons, so as to capture the full contents of the tweets and feed it to the model in an understandable way. In an ablation study, we explore whether adding social media data from the general public on Bitcoin improves the model's ability to predict extreme price movements. Finally, we propose and backtest a trading strategy based on the predictions of our models with varying prediction threshold and show that it can be used to build a profitable trading strategy with a reduced risk over a 'hold' or moving average strategy.

AB In medical image datasets, discrete labels are often used to describe a continuous spectrum of conditions, making unsupervised image stratification a challenging task. In this work, we propose VAESim, an architecture for image stratification based on a conditional variational autoencoder. VAESim learns a set of prototypical vectors during training, each associated with a cluster in a continuous latent space. We perform a soft assignment of each data sample to the clusters and reconstruct the sample based on a similarity measure between the sample embedding and the prototypical vectors. To update the prototypical embeddings, we use an exponential moving average of the most similar representations between actual prototypes and samples in the batch size. We test our approach on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and the PneumoniaMNIST medical benchmark dataset, where we show that our method outperforms baselines in terms of kNN accuracy (up to +15% improvement in performance) and performs at par with classification models trained in a fully supervised way. Our model also outperforms current end-to-end models for unsupervised stratification.

AB Many traditional bearing fault detection techniques rely on pattern recognition using black box machine learning models, which lack generalizability to out of sample cases and are generally only effective for an a priori defined operating condition set. Therefore, the developed models are required to be retrained each time the operating condition changes because of the dependence of the dynamic response on them. The lack of effective techniques that can be applied and adapted to different operation domains of the system is a well-established need, which motivates the development of hybrid approaches which integrate both physics and data based techniques. This paper discusses the development of a hybrid physics-informed method that integrates information from physics and data for fault diagnostics of a rotor-bearing system. A physics-based model is used to simulate the dynamics of the system in a defect free condition and a machine fault simulator is used to generate experimental data. Physics-informed features are extracted by residual-based and cross-sample entropy techniques, while the data-based features are obtained using Proper and Smooth Orthogonal Decomposition techniques. Subsequently, these two collections of extracted features are fused into a hybrid feature set. Then, the features are ranked using the Shapley values ranking technique. Comparing the accuracy of classifications upon using the features of physics-informed, data-based and hybrid sets shows improved capability of the proposed framework to generalize diagnostics for various operating conditions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Biometrics on mobile devices has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as it is considered a userfriendly authentication method. This interest has also been motivated by the success of Deep Learning (DL). Architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have established convenience for the task, improving the performance and robustness in comparison to traditional machine learning techniques. However, some aspects must still be revisited and improved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that explores and proposes a novel gait biometric recognition systems based on Transformers, which currently obtain state-of-the-art performance in many applications. Several state-of-the-art architectures (Vanilla, Informer, Autoformer, Block-Recurrent Transformer, and THAT) are considered in the experimental framework. In addition, new Transformer configurations are proposed to further increase the performance. Experiments are carried out using the two popular public databases: whuGAIT and OU-ISIR. The results achieved prove the high ability of the proposed Transformer, outperforming state-of-the-art CNN and RNN architectures.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Relying on the availability of massive labeled samples, most neural architecture search (NAS) methods focus on searching large and complex models; and adopt fixed structures and parameters at the infer-ence stage. Few approaches automatically design lightweight networks for label-limited tasks and fur-ther consider the inference differences between inputs. To address these issues, we introduce evolution-ary computation (EC) and attention mechanism and propose a knowledge transfer evolutionary search for lightweight neural architecture with dynamic inference, then verify it using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. SAR image classification is a typical label-limited task due to the inherent imaging mecha-nism of SAR. We design the EC-based architecture search and attention-based dynamic inference for SAR image scene classification. Specifically, we build a SAR-tailored search space, explore topology pruning -based mutation operators to search lightweight architectures, and further design a dynamic Ridgelet con-volution capable of adaptive reasoning to enhance the representation ability of searched lightweight net-works. Moreover, we propose a knowledge transfer training strategy and hybrid evaluation criteria to ensure searching quickly and robustly. Experimental results show that the proposed method can search for superior neural architectures, thus improving the classification performance of SAR images.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hyperspectral anomaly detection is aimed at detecting targets with significant spectral differences from their surroundings. Recently, deep generative models have been applied to anomaly detections, while the existing generative adversarial network (GAN)-based methods have difficulty in accurately modeling the background and achieving spectrum reconstruction. In this article, a hyperspectral anomaly detection network based on variational background inference and generative adversarial framework (VBIGAN-AD) is proposed. The proposed VBIGAN model can learn the background distribution characteristics of HSIs and enhance the detection performance by the use of reconstruction errors. Specifically, the VBIGAN frame-work consists of sample and latent GANs, which establishes the relationship between data samples and latent samples through two sub-networks to capture the data distribution. Furthermore, the variational inference method is introduced and the hyperspectral background distribution can be converged to a multivariate normal distribution. To accurately learn the background distribution characteristics and re-construct the background spectra, the coupling loss is conducted by enforcing feature match in the two discriminators on the basis of composite loss, and the results show that the additional loss can promote the detection performance. As a result, the reconstruction errors generated by the VBIGAN-AD method is utilized to detect abnormal targets. The experiments conducted on five datasets proved the robustness and applicability of the proposed VBIGAN-AD method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a rapid static parameter inverse method for concrete-faced rockfill dams based on displacement data using an improved cloud surrogate model and the Jaya optimization algorithm. The improved cloud surrogate model (ICSM), which evolved from the uncertainty cloud theory, is used rapidly to establish a nonlinear relationship between static parameters and displacement. The Jaya optimization algorithm, which is proficient in recognizing the extreme value of the objective function, is selected for parameter identification. To verify the performance of the proposed method, an inverse analysis of two numerical models and a real engineering project is considered, and a comparative study with the BP neural network as the surrogate model is conducted. Study results demonstrate that ICSM has an extremely high prediction accuracy, with a mean relative error that is always under 1 %. The prediction accuracy does not increase too much even under complex nonlinear conditions or when dealing with sparse training data. Moreover, Jaya-ICSM maintains high computational efficiency throughout the entire inverse analysis, saving more than 98 % of the time compared to another inverse method and proving to be much better than direct inversion based on the finite element method. This enables real-time inverse analysis and state feedback of complex engineering. The results also illustrate that the Jaya-ICSM is promising in parameter recognition and superior in supporting the displacement evaluation of earth-rock dams. Therefore, the proposed method can be an effective tool for engineers to evaluate the safety of earth-rockfill dams and ensure their long-term stability.

AB The development of BIM (Building Information Modeling) parametric modeling technology has improved the reusability and modeling efficiency of building information models. Aiming at the problems of too many parameters and long time in the rapid parametric construction of the bridge BIM model, we propose a novel parametric rapid construction method of bridge BIM model based on the integration of CBR (Case Based Reasoning) and RBR (Rule Based Reasoning), which is used to realize the rapid construction of bridge BIM model. Firstly, the modeling characteristics of CBR and RBR are analyzed, and a parametric modeling framework of CBR-RBR fusion is proposed. Secondly, a MHPO (Modified Hunter-Prey Optimization) algorithm is proposed to assign the weight of feature parameters to improve the accuracy of the prediction model. Then, modeling parameter reasoning rules are designed to realize the construction of parameter reasoning model. Finally, the prototype system is developed to verify the proposed method based on Revit and C#. Compared with manual modeling and traditional parametric modeling, the fusion method of CBR and RBR greatly shortens the modeling time and improves modeling efficiency and flexibility.

AB Reports of deteriorating mental health among citizens constitute an urgent global health alert. Electronic mental health (EMH) platforms are a great resource for mitigating mental health disorders. Extant literature on EMH has determined the attributes and indicators that reflect the feasibility, acceptability and safety of EMH platforms. However, these evaluation indicators are complex and usually conflict each other in the decision -making process. Moreover, the evaluation indicators are qualitative in nature and may be characterized by fuzziness and imprecision. Therefore, selecting an EMH platform becomes a complex cognitive process. Given the ubiquity of EMH platforms and the absence of a comprehensive decision-making model, we present a novel probabilistic reliable linguistic multi-attribute decision making (PRLMADM) model. With this model, we employ the probabilistic reliable linguistic term sets (PRLTSs) to solve decision makers' (DMs) uncertainty and reliability of evaluation information. We construct a novel Pearson correlation measure for PRLTSs and extend it to design a weighting method known as probabilistic reliable linguistic CRiteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation (PRL-CRITIC). Employing the TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for Interactive Multicriteria Decision Making) and the PROBID (Preference Ranking on the Basis of Ideal-average Distance) techniques, we propose the probabilistic reliable linguistic (PRL) TODIM-based PROBID ranking approach, which considers the DMs' bounded rationality. Finally, we present an illustrative example of EMH platform selection to prove the applicability of the proposed model. We demonstrate the benefits of our probabilistic reliable linguistic TODIM-based PROBID model through a series of comparisons and sensitivity analyses.

AB The imbalance is an inevitable problem in mechanical fault diagnostics, as most of the monitored samples for mechanical devices are normal, which results in the decision boundary of the classifier being heavily driven by the dominant class and ignoring the minority class. To settle this problem, a transferable dynamic enhanced cost-sensitive network (TDECN) is proposed in this study. Within this framework, the maximum classifier discrepancy approach is utilized as the backbone, in which sliced 1-Wasserstein discrepancy is exploited to measure the distance between two outputs and detect outlier targets. By doing this, the relationship between the task-specific decision border and the target features during distribution matching is considered. Simultaneously, a dynamic enhanced focal loss (DEL) is devised and embedded into the network. which makes the model pay more attention to error-prone and minor class instances compared with routine focal loss. Finally, extensive diagnostic experiments were implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed TDECN. The noticeable accuracy improvement demonstrates that our method is superior in resolving imbalanced cross-domain fault diagnosis problems over other approaches.

AB In the context of promoting autonomous decision, intelligent interaction, and concept recognition of the equipment, constructing an equipment Knowledge Graph (KG) is the key technology to facilitate this. In this article, we propose a method that combines design rules and automatic extraction to construct equipment KG from equipment manuals. We define that equipment KG is scheme-based and depicts scheme in the form of KG triples (a.k.a design rules, scheme layer of KG, or concept KG). Our contributions include designing an initial concept KG for the equipment domain and improving the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to jointly extract knowledge from texts to enrich the KG. The BERT model was improved from internal calculations so that joint extraction could be achieved directly without extra additional parts. We applied our model to a standard dataset "SemEval2010 Task 8"and achieved the F1 score of 89.55 which demonstrates its rationality. We also established a dataset called "Equipment Manuals Corpus for KG"based on the concept KG and applied the joint model in the dataset to extract knowledge. The result was visualized in the form of a graph.

AB The Fokker-Planck equation has significant applications in dynamical systems. In recent years, some neural network methods have been used in combination with physical models to obtain its numerical solutions. However, it is also appealing if the analytical solution of the physical model can be obtained. This paper proposes a neural network-based method for the analytical solution of the FP equation. It relies on neural networks and uses their explicit model as the trial function for the FP equation. The trial function contains the weights and biases in the neural network. Therefore, the solving of the FP equation is converted into the calculation of the weights and biases. In the proposed method, the FP equations are first reduced to a set of easily solvable nonlinear algebraic equations using some trial functions, and then the corresponding weights and biases are determined using the method of pending coefficients. In this paper, linear and nonlinear numerical examples were used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can obtain the exact solution of the FP equations without data samples. Finally, the proposed method is compared in detail with physics-informed neural networks in terms of computational theory and computational effectiveness.

AB Genome assembly is the computational process of merging short parts of DNA into larger sequences called contigs. Rapid growth of high-throughput genome sequencing technologies and production of large amount of data have led to the genome assembly paradigms shift from shared memory to distributed memory systems in the recent years. Among the existing assembly algorithms, the iterative de Bruijn Graph is a leading approach for assembling short reads. This approach by exploring the advantages of all k between kmin to kmax, generates high quality assembly. However, the assembly operations are decelerated especially in the larger data sets. RMI-DBG is an agile iterative de Bruijn Graph algorithm that has the computational efficiency of de Bruijn Graph methods and the flexibility of overlap-based algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a distributed iterative DBG model based on RMI-DBG, named DRMI-DBG. The proposed idea is to address the problem of parallelizing the de Bruijn Graph construction and processing on distributed memory systems at each iteration of the algorithm. DRMI-DBG is a scalable iterative DBG framework over a Hadoop cluster by applying the power of Spark (a batch processing engine) and Giraph (a distributed big graph processing system). Experiments on a variety of real data sets show that DRMI-DBG accelerates the performance of RMI-DBG algorithm and IDBA-UD assembler up to 4.8 times with comparable or better results in the quality of the assembly. For more evaluation, performance of the proposed model is compared to ScalaDBG, as the state-of-the-art distributed assembler based on the multiple k-values strategy.

AB Accurately predicting volatility has always been the focus of government decision-making departments, financial regulators and academia. Therefore, it is very crucial to precisely predict the realized volatility (RV) of the stock price index. In this paper, we take the RV sequences of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC), Standard & Poor 500 index (SPX) and Financial Times Stock Exchange Index (FTSE) as the research objects, and propose a predictive model based on optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD), deep learning models including deep belief network (DBN), long short-term memory network (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), and reinforcement learning Q-learning algorithm. Firstly, the original RV sequence is decomposed by using the VMD ideal parameters optimized by grey wolf optimizer (GWO) to obtain the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Then, DBN, LSTM and GRU are used to predict same IMF simultaneously. Finally, the optimal weights of the above three models are determined by the Q-learning algorithm to construct an integrated model, and the final results are obtained after accumulating the predicted values of each IMF. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated by four loss functions: the mean average error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), heterogeneous mean average error (HMAE), heterogeneous mean squared error (HMSE) and modified Diebold and Mariano test (MDM). The experimental results show that the constructed GVMD-Q-DBN-LSTM-GRU method has better performance that the comparison model in both emerging and developed markets.

AB In many applications, we need algorithms which can align partially overlapping point sets and are invari-ant to the corresponding transformations. In this work, a method possessing such properties is realized by minimizing the objective of the robust point matching (RPM) algorithm. We first show that the RPM objective is a cubic polynomial. We then utilize the convex envelopes of trilinear and bilinear monomials to derive its lower bound function. The resulting lower bound problem has the merit that it can be effi-ciently solved via linear assignment and low dimensional convex quadratic programming. We next develop a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm which only branches over the transformation variables and runs efficiently. Experimental results demonstrated better robustness of the proposed method against non-rigid deformation, positional noise and outliers in case that outliers are not mixed with inliers when compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. They also showed that it has competitive efficiency and scales well with problem size.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The random forest family has been extensively studied due to its wide applications in machine learning and data analytics. However, the representation abilities of forests have not been explored yet. The existing forest representation is mainly based on feature hashing on the indices of leaf nodes. Feature hashing typically disregards the information from tree structures, i.e., the relationships between leaf nodes. Furthermore, the visualisation abilities of feature hashing are limited. On the contrary, the Skip-Gram model has been widely explored in word and node embedding due to its excellent representation ability. This paper proposes distributed representation learning for trained forests (DRL-TF) to extract co-occurrence relationships of samples and tree structures, and further boost the representation abilities of the trained forest using the Skip-Gram model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-TF outperforms the challenging baselines. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the visualisation by DRL-TF is the first tool to analyse the trained forests. The code is available at: https://github.com/machao199271/ DRL-TF.

AB Z-number expresses the membership degrees of an element to a set by several possibilities and their reliability. Therefore, it has a great advantage in dealing with fuzziness and uncertainty especially for multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM). In this paper, a novel approach, named HFLT-Z-h-ELECTRE II which incorporates Z-number into ELECTRE II is proposed to handle divergent views of group members and vague information. Specifically, hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) helps experts to express evaluations about membership degrees. And a developed group consensus model enriched by reliance degree and cumulative prospect theory for further consideration is equipped for expert weights which replace the second part of Z-number in a brand-new perspective. Additionally, a corresponding average support degree function which is beneficial to comparing each pair of criteria is proposed. An application example about sustainable construction material suppliers selection is operated for experiment to show application and practicality of the proposal. Afterwards, further comparative analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to explore the impacts of parameters and discuss the merits of our proposal.

AB Automatic apple harvesting robots have received much research attention in recent years to lower harvesting costs. A fundamental problem for harvesting robots is how to quickly and accurately detect branches to avoid collisions with limited hardware resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, high-accurate and real-time semantic segmentation network, Bilateral U-shape Network (BUNet), to segment apple tree branches. The BUNet consists mainly of a U-shaped detail branch and a U-shaped semantic branch, the former for capturing spatial details and the latter for supplementing semantic information. These two U-shape branches complement each other, keeping the high accuracy of the Encoder-decoder Backbone while maintaining the efficiency and effectiveness of the Two-pathway Backbone. In addition, a Simplified Attention Fusion Module (SAFM) is proposed to effectively fuse different levels of information from two branches for pixel-by-pixel prediction. Experimental results show (on our own constructed dataset) that BUNet achieves the highest Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1-score of 75.96% and 86.34%, respectively, with minimum parameters of 0.93M and 11.94G Floating-point of Operations (FLOPs) in branch segmentation. Meanwhile, BUNet achieves a speed of 110.32 Frames Per Second (FPS) with input image size of 1280x720 pixels. These results confirm that the proposed method can effectively detect the branches and can, therefore, be used to plan an obstacle avoidance path for harvesting robots.

ID DECISION TREES; LISTS
AB Decision trees are a popular classification model in machine learning due to their interpretability and performance. Decision-tree classifiers are traditionally constructed using greedy heuristic algorithms that do not provide guarantees regarding the quality of the resultant trees. In contrast, a recent line of work employed exact optimization techniques to construct optimal decision-tree classifiers. However, most of these approaches are designed for datasets with binary features. While numeric and categorical features can be transformed into binary features, this transformation can introduce a large number of binary features and may not be efficient in practice. In this work, we present a SAT-based encoding for decision trees that directly supports non-binary data and use it to solve two well-studied variants of the optimal decision tree problem. Furthermore, we extend our approach to support cost-sensitive learning of optimal decision trees and introduce tree pruning constraints to reduce overfitting. We perform extensive experiments based on real-world and synthetic datasets that show that our approach obtains superior performance to state-of-the-art exact techniques on non-binary datasets and has significantly smaller memory consumption. We also show that our extension for cost-sensitive learning and our tree pruning constraints can help improve the prediction quality on unseen test data.

AB Negotiation is a key form of interaction in multi-agent systems. Negotiation enables agents to come to a mutual agreement about a goal or plan of action. Current negotiation approaches use traditional interaction protocols which do not capture the normative meaning of interactions and often restrict agent autonomy. These traditional negotiation approaches also have difficulty specifying accountability. This paper seeks to address this gap in maintaining autonomy and capturing accountability during negotiation through the use of normative commitments. We propose Nala, a commitment-based negotiation semantics. Nala uses commitments to provide normative meaning to agent interactions. The nature of commitments support in capturing accountability through the violation of created commitments. We illustrate Nala's usage via a case study using a game scenario where agents participate in negotiation to bring about their goals in a research constrained environment.

AB Classification is one of the most well-known data mining branches used in diverse domains and fields. In the literature, many different classification techniques, such as statistical/intelligent, linear/nonlinear, fuzzy/crisp, shallow/deep, and single/hybrid, have been developed to cover data and systems with different characteristics. Intelligent classification approaches, especially deep learning classifiers, due to their unique features to provide accurate and efficient results, have recently attracted a lot of attention. However, in the learning process of the intelligent classifiers, a continuous distance-based cost function is used to estimate the connection weights, though the goal function in classification problems is discrete and using a continuous cost function in their learning process is unreasonable and inefficient. In this paper, a novel discrete learning-based methodology is proposed to estimate the connection weights of intelligent classifiers more accurately. In the proposed learning process, they are discretely adjusted and at once jumped to the target. This is in contrast to conventional continuous learning algorithms in which the connection weights are continuously adjusted and step by step near the target. In the present research, the proposed methodology is exemplarily applied to the deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the most recognized deep classification approaches, with a solid mathematical foundation and strong practical results in complex problems. Although the proposed methodology is just implemented on the DNN, it is a general methodology that can be similarly applied to other shallow and deep intelligent classification models. It can be generally demonstrated that the performance of the proposed discrete learning-based DNN (DIDNN) model, due to its consistency property, will not be worse than the conventional ones. The proposed DIDNN model is exemplarily evaluated on some well-known cancer classification benchmarks to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model. The empirical results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the conventional versions of the selected deep approach in all data sets. Based on the performance analysis, the DIDNN model can improve the performance of the classic version by approximately 3.39%. Therefore, using this technique is an appropriate and effective alternative to conventional DNN-based models for classification purposes.

DE Melody generation from lyrics; Controllable music generation; LSTM; GAN
AB Lyrics-to-melody generation is an interesting and challenging topic in AI music research field. Due to the difficulty of learning the correlations between lyrics and melody, previous methods suffer from low generation quality and lack of controllability. Controllability of generative models enables human interaction with models to generate desired contents, which is especially important in music generation tasks towards human-centered AI that can facilitate musicians in creative activities. To address these issues, we propose a controllable lyrics-to-melody generation network, ConL2M, which is able to generate realistic melodies from lyrics in user-desired musical style. Our work contains three main novelties: (1) to model the dependencies of music attributes cross multiple sequences, inter-branch memory fusion (Memofu) is proposed to enable information flow between multi-branch stacked LSTM architecture; (2) reference style embedding (RSE) is proposed to improve the quality of generation as well as control the musical style of generated melodies; (3) sequence-level statistical loss (SeqLoss) is proposed to help the model learn sequence-level features of melodies given lyrics. Verified by evaluation metrics for music quality and controllability, initial study of controllable lyrics-to-melody generation shows better generation quality and the feasibility of interacting with users to generate the melodies in desired musical styles when given lyrics.

AB The image dehazing is a complicated dilemma to resolve the haze density influence on the object depth. Though many pixel-based or color space-based algorithms are used by many researchers for resolving this issue, due to lack of utilizing the prominent information makes the objective not achieved properly. The main objective if this work is to dehaze an image with fine-tuned parameters. The proposed research work prioritized air light and transmittance extraction (PATE) using a novel dual weighted deep channel and spatial attention (DWDCA)-based model helps to give proper weightage for the color information to restore the prominent color. The loss information calculation framework is proposed in this model to further enhance the output. The performance analysis is done with the benchmark datasets such as i-haze, o-haze and SOTS datasets where the proposed algorithm gives significant improvements in the metrics such as PSNR, SSIM and CIEDE2000 than the state-of-the-art algorithms. The proposed dehazing model with dual weighted channel and spatial attention block effectively preserves the data and improves the vision of the image.

AB Lung cancer is known to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. There is a chance of increasing the survival rate of the patients if detected at an early stage. Computed Tomography (CT) scans are prominently used to detect and classify lung cancer nodules/tumors in the thoracic region. There is a need to develop an efficient and reliable computer-aided diagnosis model to detect lung cancer nodules accurately from CT scans. This work proposes a novel kernel-based active-contour (KAC) SegNet deep learning model to perform lung cancer nodule detection from CT scans. The active contour uses a snake method to detect internal and external boundaries of the curves, which is used to extract the Region Of Interest (ROI) from the CT scan. From the extracted ROI, the nodules are further classified into benign and malignant using a Dense AlexNet deep learning model. The key contributions of this work are the fusion of an edge detection method with a deep learning segmentation method which provides enhanced lung nodule segmentation performance, and an ensemble of state-of-the-art deep learning classifiers, which encashes the advantages of both DenseNet and AlexNet to learn better discriminative information from the detected lung nodules. The experimental outcome shows that the proposed segmentation approach achieves a Dice Score Coefficient of 97.8% and an Intersection-over-Union of 92.96%. The classification performance resulted in an accuracy of 95.65%, a False Positive Rate, and False Negative Rate values of 0.0572 and 0.0289. The proposed model is robust compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Organic synaptic transistors (OSTs) using intrinsic polymer semiconductors are demonstrated to be suitable for neuromorphic bioelectronics. However, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based copolymers are not applicable to neuromorphic computing systems because the DPP polymer film has demonstrated only short-term plasticity with short retention (<50 ms) in synaptic devices because of their intrinsic difficulty of electrochemical doping. To expand their applications toward neuromorphic computing that requires long-term plasticity, artificial synapses with extended retention time should be developed. Herein, molecular tailoring approach to extend the retention time in the ion-gel-gated OSTs that use DPP is suggested. The molecular structure is controlled by changing alkyl spacer lengths of side chains. As a result, the doping process is more favorable in DPP with long alkyl spacer, which is confirmed by high doping concentration and slow dedoping rate. Therefore, dedoping of ions is more suppressed in DPP with long alkyl side chain that exhibits extended retention time (& AP;800 s) of the OSTs. These optimized DPP-based OSTs obtain high pattern recognition accuracy of & AP;96.0% in simulations of an artificial neural network. Molecular tailoring strategies provide a guideline to overcome the intrinsic problem of short synaptic retention time of the OSTs for use in neuromorphic computing.

AB In multi-objective particle swarm optimization, it is very important to select the personal best and the global best. These leaders are expected to effectively guide the population toward the true Pareto front. In this paper, we propose a two-stage maintenance and multi-strategy selection for multi-objective particle swarm optimization (TMMOPSO), which adaptively selects the global best and updates the personal best by means of hyper-cone domain and aggregation, respectively. This strategy enhances the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of the population. In addition, the excellent particles are perturbed and a two-stage maintenance strategy is used for the external archive. This strategy not only improves the quality of the solutions in the population but also accelerates the convergence speed of the population. In this paper, the proposed algorithm is compared with several multi-objective optimization algorithms on 29 benchmark problems. The experimental results show that TMMOPSO is effective and outperforms the comparison algorithms on most of the 29 benchmark problems.

AB Parkinson's disease has no specific test for diagnosis, which is usually detected through a review of signs and symptoms like tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. Over the past 10-15 years various methods were proposed that use motor signs and voice data for the accurate detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). Cutting-edge technologies like machine learning, deep learning, image processing, and several signal Processing mechanisms were employed in the efficient diagnosis of PD. In view of this, we present a structured review of such techniques. In the ongoing research over the past few years, various datasets were generated to assess PD with the salient parameters of the voice signals acquired from healthy people and PD patients. Also, tremor and gait data were collected by recording the movements of PD patients from sensing units such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and inertial measurement unit sensors. An overall analysis has been done on the various techniques with respect to the voice dataset and motion sensor data. A detailed analysis suggests that machine and deep learning approaches are optimistic in developing clinical applications.

AB This paper presents a new application of the secure communication system (SCS) of the chaotic systems with experimentally verification of wireless devices together with a new stability condition of disturbance observer, which is used to reject the attack signals on public channels and uncertain values on both master and slave of the secure communication system. To ensure the security of the text message transmission, the states of two nonidentical chaotic systems are used to encrypt and decrypt the signal, respectively. To synchronize the slave and master, first, the Lorenz chaotic system is remodeled into the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy (TSF) model for softening the designs of the controller and observer. Second, to meet the requirement of the sent and received signals are identical, the synchronization controller was designed based on the adaptive sliding mode control (SMC). The adaptive laws of the controller are based on the regulating boundary of saturation thickness. Third, to prevent the attack signals on the public channels and the variations of the system parameters, the disturbance observer (DO) was newly proposed. This is a new contribution of the paper to the area of disturbance observer design. Fourth, the stability of the proposed control method was proved using the Lyapunov condition. Final, the performances of the proposed method are demonstrated via simulation using MATLAB software and experiment using the chips WiFi ESP8266 Shields. The obtained results with attacked signals and parameter' variations were mostly rejected both in simulation and experimental studies. The states of MSSs are identical. Therefore, the sent and received data are completely secured and identical.

AB In recent years, some researchers have put forth the compactness hypothesis, which suggests that similar colours tend to accumulate in the salient region as opposed to the non-salient region in image saliency detection. We discovered that the k-nearest neighbour (kNN) mechanism assumes the presence of similar objects in close proximity. As the kNN method is a supervised learning approach, we introduced an unfixed k value and combined it with the clustering idea of k-means to develop a novel algorithm called kNN clustering. We proposed an object-biased prior and an improved boundary and background prior based on a given compact matrix. Our algorithm was extensively tested on five publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that it outperformed eight existing top unsupervised models in producing high-quality saliency maps at full resolution. The improved prior methods were particularly effective when employed with existing algorithms lacking prior knowledge, especially with low-performing models.

   RESUME
AB Supervised learning of spiking neurons is an effective simulation method to explore the learning mechanism of real neurons. Desired output spike trains are often used as supervised signals to control the synaptic strength adjustment of neurons for precise emission. The goal of supervised learning is also to allow spiking neurons to enter the desired running and firing state. The running process of a spiking neuron is a continuous process, but because of absolute refractory periods, it is regarded as several running segments. Based on the segmental characteristic, a new supervised learning strategy for spiking neurons is proposed to expand the action mode of supervised signals in supervised learning. Desired output spikes are used to actively regulate the running segments and make them more efficient in achieving the desired running and firing state. Supervised signals actively regulate the running process of neurons and are more comprehensively involved in the learning process than simply participating in adjusting synaptic weights. Based on two weight adjustment mechanisms of spiking neurons, two new specific supervised learning methods are proposed. The experimental results obtained using various settings indicate that the two learning methods have higher learning performance, which indicates the effectiveness of the new learning strategy.

AB Nowadays, automated guided vehicles (AGVs) play a key role in manufacturing systems because of improving system efficiency and lowering the cost of production. To increase the efficiency and stability of AGVs, it is crucial to consider maintenance planning for them. To the best of our knowledge, there are rarely found studies related to maintenance planning and AGVs' design and control. Accordingly, in this paper, a new integrated nonlinear mathematical model is developed for optimizing the AGV design (including AGV fleet sizing and AGV assignment to workshops) and preventive maintenance policy. The proposed model aims to determine the preventive maintenance cycles, the optimal number of employed AGVs in manufacturing, and the optimal assignment of AGVs to manufacturing workshops so that the total cost is minimized. To solve this model, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed, and its performance is compared with the global solver of LINGO software on 15 test problems, some of which are large dimensions. To tune the GA parameters, a Taguchi method is used. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is performed to represent the validity of the model and solution approach. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness of GA in terms of computational time and solution quality.

AB In speech conversation systems, the specific distribution of computing resources is very complex, and resource requirements exhibit dynamic changes. If the evaluation of customer needs is too low, computing resources cannot complete the work proposed by the customer. If customer demand is overestimated, many computing resources are wasted and idle, and a reasonable environmental resource allocation algorithm is the top priority in solving the problem. As mankind enters the information modernization society, multimedia technology and Internet technology are increasingly being widely used in various fields of society, including online teaching. In lifelong learning systems, online English teaching is now an essential learning method. However, online learning has been widely used in the world. When engaging in online learning activities, it is found that there are insufficient systematic research and low participation in learning. People can access a large number of very rich learning resources on the Internet. In the online learning process, learners can fully exert their autonomy and initiative to cultivate and expand their own innovation and practical abilities. When participating in the learning process of online courses, learners can not only develop themselves, but also strengthen effective coordination and communication with others and society, enabling them to coordinate the development of all aspects of their own abilities, improving learning effectiveness and efficiency. This article aims to promote the better development of online English teaching through the research on environmental resource allocation based on voice dialog systems and its application to online English teaching.

ID DEFENSE
AB Building an efficient system for detection of DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks is essential in network security management. Existing studies on DDOS attacks can be divided into three categories: statistical library building, IP address information entropy, and machine learning, which, however, all suffer some shortcomings: the statistical library algorithm needs massive historical data for training and has low capacities for generalization; machine learning algorithms have complex computing processes and require massive resources; the IP address information entropy algorithm can detect very limited elements of attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes a network quintuple information entropy detection algorithm based on judgment matrix hierarchy analysis, which counts the network quintuple information entropy from 10 to 100% and determines the judgment matrix evaluation model. Experiments showed that our algorithm reached a detection rate of 100% under different intensities of DDOS attacks, while the rate for the algorithms based on source IP and target IP is only 70% and 50%. The experiments have proved that the algorithm presented here has superior detection performance and good generalization capacities.

AB Foreign trade English learning ability refers to students' awareness and ability to actively use and adapt to foreign trade English learning strategies, broaden foreign trade English learning channels, and enhance the impact of English learning on foreign trade. Learning ability is the development condition for students to form core literacy. It supports project-based learning of students' ability to learn English in foreign trade. On the basis of reading, students need to complete the project through tasks such as surveys and interviews, information retrieval, exchange reports, and exhibition comments. Specific research, and develop students' critical thinking skills, collaborative communication skills, knowledge application skills, and innovation skills. With the development of deeper foreign trade, speech recognition has become one of the mainstream methods based on time-delayed neural network learning. However, there are still some problems in the current research process. On the one hand, there is still a lack of in-depth research on TDNN and how to better extract the context features of delayed neural networks on different time scales; on the other hand, end-to-end speech recognition is easy to be used in speech recognition scenarios with resource shortages. Encountered the problem of insufficient data, resulting in performance degradation. The virtual experiment system proposed in this paper uses virtual reality technology and visualization technology to reduce the cost of the experiment and promote the progress of the experiment through the visual expression of related theoretical knowledge and operating scenarios.

AB Since the last decade radio frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as an alternative in-home monitoring and tracking technology because of its inherent device-free and privacy-preserved features over camera and wearable technologies. In this work, contrary to conventional radar-based sensing and WiFi-based setups which require line-of-sight (LoS) to process and collect the RF signals for monitoring, it is shown for the first time in literature the potential of using RF sensing for vitals, that is, heartbeat detection in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) using an in-house-developed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), that is, wireless on the walls. The developed RIS is the world's first prototype which consists of "4096 elements". The unit cell elements are individually controlled via PIN diodes, 1-bit, operating at 3.75 GHz specified for the fifth-generation (5G) network. Near-field beam steering is demonstrated, with a switching speed of 15 ms. For the first time in the literature its is demonstrated that RIS can assist in the detection of microactivities including the human heartbeat in NLoS indoor complex environment, a limitation with the existing RF sensing technologies to date. In addition, it is experimentally verified that the RIS can potentially reduce the e-field magnitude at the user's by regulating the gain at the user terminal.

AB Sub-millimeter robots-microrobots-that can autonomously perform mechanical work at the microscale would radically change new areas of human activity such as micromanipulation, microfabrication, or healthcare. Sets of identical microrobots that can connect into different, larger structures open the possibility for a "universal" microrobotic unit that fulfills a large variety of functions derived from the structure that multiple units can be assembled into. The capability of individual hydrogel microcrawlers to self-assemble under confinement into periodically ordered planar structures is demonstrated. Subsequently, these can be bound together using light to form a solid porous sheet. The lateral shape of the sheet is imprinted during the binding process. Furthermore, the sheets bend into 3D structures, where the bending direction can be programmed. The resulting structures actuate anisotropically when exposed to heat or laser illumination and can be designed for various modes of operation, such as manipulation or untethered locomotion. The formation of ordered microstructures from individual mobile robots enables easier transport and remote assembly of these structures at the place of interest without the need for direct intervention.

AB Soft robots have better flexibility than their rigid counterparts thus offering greater adaptability to changing environments. These robots made from flexible materials are generally with low stiffness and have limited capability to perform tasks that require the application of large forces. Soft artificial muscles (AMs) with variable stiffness are promising solutions for soft robots to handle larger payloads. However, the existing actuators need to overcome their small range of stiffness variation and slow response. Further, it is difficult to integrate self-sensing into existing actuators. Herein, a novel electric AM with variable stiffness and self-sensing referencing smooth muscle contraction in nature is proposed. The AM consists of two pieces of soft anode mesh, a flexible cathode and a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel dielectric layer, where the cathode is also a resistive sensor. The stiffness variation is induced by the friction change caused by electrostatic adsorption. Compared with the existing PVC gel actuation technology, the new design integrated the dielectric and the cathode layers and combined the sensing function. Also, the rigid anode and cathode are replaced by the soft ones, respectively, which makes the AM suitable for soft robotics or wearable devices.

ID VARIABILITY
AB Herein, novel neural network (NN) methods that improve prediction accuracy and reduce output variance of the optimized input in the gradient method for cross-sectional data are proposed, and the variability evaluation approach of optimized inputs in the semiconductor process is suggested. Specifically, electrical parameter measurements (EPMs) and power-delay product of industrial high-k metal gate DRAM peripheral 29-stage ring oscillator circuits, including NMOS, PMOS, and interconnects, are focused on. The proposed methods find an optimized input to achieve a lower NN output variance in the gradient descent than one multilayer perceptron (MLP) and mean ensemble of MLPs even when considering the variabilities of the devices and interconnects. The local optima problem of one MLP is resolved by utilizing multiple MLPs trained with different train/validation data, their trimmed mean, and an additional learnable layer. Moreover, adding the learnable layer secures versatility for various parametric datasets. The methods improve the prediction accuracy (R-2) by 5.6-15.6% in sparse data space compared to one MLP and the mean ensemble, decrease the NN output variance of the optimized input by 73.0-81.6% compared to one MLP and the mean ensemble, and are successfully verified by implementing it on EPMs of 3977 test patterns of 314 wafers and 16 lots.

AB We define a discrete analogue of the characteristic function for discrete random variable and develop numerical procedures for computing the discrete characteristic function for several well-known discrete random variables. We rigorously define what is meant by the Fourier transform of a probability mass function and also show how to reverse the process to recover the probability mass function of a discrete random variable, given a procedure for computing the characteristic function. Unlike previous work on the subject, our approach is novel in that we are not computing closed-form solutions of a continuous random variable but are focused on applying the methods to real-world data sets.

AB The purpose of model transfer is to solve the problem that multivariate calibration models cannot be shared among different near-infrared spectrometers. Taking gasoline as the research object, the transfer analysis of its octane number model was carried out. The gasoline samples collected by two near-infrared spectrometers of the same type were used as the research object. The screening wavelengths with consistent and stable signals (SWCSS) combined with competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), and successive projections algorithm (SPA) were used to reduce the adverse effects of invalid wavelengths in the SWCSS method; therefore, the analysis ability of the master model to the slave samples was improved. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models based on SWCSS-UVE, SWCSS-CARS, and SWCSS-SPA algorithms were established, and comparison was made between their analytical capabilities for slave samples and those of SWCSS, direct standardization (DS) algorithm , piecewise direct standardization (PDS) algorithm, and slope/bias (S/B) algorithm. The results shown that the SWCSS-UVE and SWCSS-CARS methods can be used to establish models from the 231 and 6 wavelengths selected from the consistent wavelengths, respectively. The root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of the gasoline octane number (RON) content of the direct analysis of the spectrum measured by the slave machine was reduced from 5.7490 to 0.3226 and 0.3250, respectively, which was better than the single SWCSS and DS, PDS, and SWCSS-SPA methods, and was close to the model transfer accuracy of the S/B algorithm. The transfer accuracy of SWCSS-UVE and SWCSS-CARS was not much different, but the wavelength variable involved in the model transfer of the latter was much smaller than that of the former, and the AIC value of SWCSS-CARS was -59.59, which was much smaller than the akaike information criterion (AIC) value of SWCSS-UVE 398.42.

   Evolutionary algorithms; Makespan accuracy
AB Task scheduling in scientific workflows represents an NP-hard problem due to the number of interdependent tasks, data transfers, and the possible execution infrastructure assignments in cloud computing. For this reason, metaheuristics are one of the most widely applied optimisation techniques. Makespan is one of the main objectives in this problem. However, this metric needs to be complemented with a quality measure with respect to the actual execution time in order to avoid incurring more costs than expected by using an over-optimistic approximation. This research applies a new enhanced disk-network-computing evaluation model, that takes into account the communication among the storage devices involved, which plays an important role in actual schedules. The model is implemented in a genetic algorithm and the well-known heuristic HEFT. We propose different hybridisation metaheuristics in conjunction with a new accuracy metric to measure the difference between the makespan approximations and the real one. The new evaluation model is able to improve accuracy with respect to the standard model, and the proposed hybrid methods significantly improve makespan in the case of heterogeneous infrastructures.

AB The main strategy of this paper is intended to speed up the convergence of the inertial Mann iterative method and further speed up it through the normal S-iterative method for a certain class of nonexpansive-type operators that are linked with variational inequality problems. Our new convergence theory permits us to settle down the difficulty of unification of Korpelevich's extragradient method, Tseng's extragardient method, and subgardient extragardient method for solving variational inequality problems through an auxiliary algorithmic operator, which is associated with the seed operator. The paper establishes an interesting the fact that the relaxed inertial normal S-iterative extragradient methods do influence much more on convergence behaviour. Finally, the numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate that the relaxed inertial iterative methods; in particular, the relaxed inertial normal S-iterative extragradient methods may have a number of advantages over other methods in computing solutions to variational inequality problems in many cases.

AB Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) systems aim to capture high-dimensional (=3D) images in a single shot using 2D detectors. SCI devices consist of two main parts: a hardware encoder and a software decoder. The hardware encoder typically consists of an (optical) imaging system designed to capture compressed measurements. The software decoder, on the other hand, refers to a reconstruction algorithm that retrieves the desired high-dimensional signal from those measurements. In this paper, leveraging the idea of deep unrolling, we propose an SCI recovery algorithm, namely GAP-net, which unfolds the generalized alternating projection (GAP) algorithm. At each stage, GAP-net passes its current estimate of the desired signal through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN operates as a denoiser projecting the estimate back to the desired signal space. For the GAP-net that employs trained auto-encoder-based denoisers, we prove a probabilistic global convergence result. Finally, we investigate the performance of GAP-net in solving video SCI and spectral SCI problems. In both cases, GAP-net demonstrates competitive performance on both synthetic and real data. In addition to its high accuracy and speed, we show that GAP-net is flexible with respect to signal modulation implying that a trained GAP-net decoder can be applied in different systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/mengziyi64/GAP-net.

AB The emerging event cameras have the potential to be an excellent complement for standard cameras within various visual tasks, especially in illumination-changing environments or situations requiring high-temporal resolution. Herein, an event-based stereo visual odometry (VO) system via adaptive time-surface (TS) and truncated signed distance function (TSDF), namely, T-ESVO, is proposed . The system consists of three carefully designed components, including the event processing unit, the mapping unit, and the tracking unit. Specifically, the event processing unit adopts a novel spatial-temporal adaptive TS that can deal with different camera motions in various environments. The mapping unit introduces the TSDF to describe the 3D representation of environments and achieves depth estimation based on the global historical depth information contained in the environmental TSDF description. The tracking unit achieves the 6-DoF pose estimation through an 3D-2D registration method based on the left/right TS selection mechanism and the depth point selection mechanism. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system are evaluated on various datasets, and the experimental results show that T-ESVO achieves good performance in both accuracy and robustness when compared with other state-of-the-art event-based stereo VO systems.

AB Herein, the cognitive capability of a simple, paper-based Miura-ori-using the physical reservoir computing framework-is experimentally examined to achieve different information perception tasks. The body dynamics of Miura-ori (aka its vertices displacements), which is excited by a simple harmonic base excitation, can be exploited as the reservoir computing resource. By recording these dynamics with a high-resolution camera and image processing program and then using linear regression for training, it is shown that the origami reservoir has sufficient computing capacity to estimate the weight and position of a payload. It can also recognize the input frequency and magnitude patterns. Furthermore, multitasking is achievable by simultaneously applying two targeted functions to the same reservoir state matrix. Therefore, it is demonstrated that Miura-ori can assess the dynamic interactions between its body and ambient environment to extract meaningful information-an intelligent behavior in the mechanical domain. Given that Miura-ori has been widely used to construct deployable structures, lightweight materials, and compliant robots, enabling such information perception tasks can add a new dimension to the functionality of such a versatile structure.

AB Lung disease has become a leading cause of disease-related death, making it one of the most serious health problems in the world. Due to the advantages of fast postoperative recovery and small trauma, transbronchoscopic biopsy has become the main method for the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, limited by the large outer diameter of the bronchoscope, insufficient flexibility of the biopsy needle, and lack of force sensing, traditional biopsy operation is simple and rough, and it is difficult to enter the deep narrow areas of the lung for examination. In this article, a flexible biopsy robot with force-sensing ability is proposed. The robot is composed of a tendon-actuated catheter and an inner sliding flexible needle as well as their driving systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the robot has good positioning accuracy of 0.72 mm and high flexibility and repeatability. With the cooperation of the commercial bronchoscope, the robot can reach various narrow areas of the lung to perform biopsy operations. The proposed robot has the potential to improve the diagnosis rate of lung diseases and reduce related deaths.

AB Medical imaging techniques, such as mammography, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, plays an integral role in the detection and characterization of breast cancer. Although computers are believed to gain an important role in the assessment of medical images for breast evaluation for at least two decades, their impact on performance has not lived up to expectations yet. With the continuous and rapid development of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, like machine learning and deep learning, have been introduced for the analysis of medical images. Because of the remarkable advances in data extraction and analysis in medical imaging compared to conventional feature-based techniques, AI has reignited the interest in automated breast image interpretation. Extensive research is conducted on accurate detection and classification of breast lesions, and more specifically, the predictive and prognostic features of breast cancer by radiomics. Radiomics exploits the fact that image data is nowadays numerical and can also be used to generate quantitative biomarkers. In this comprehensive review, we cover the progress, application and challenge of radiomics and AI in breast cancer diagnosis in recent years, as well as the impact and significance of AI on future breast cancer research.

AB Autonomous vehicles are required to operate in an uncertain environment. Recent advances in computational intelligence techniques make it possible to understand driving scenes in various environments by using a semantic segmentation neural network, which assigns a class label to each pixel. It requires massive pixel-level labelled data to optimise the network. However, it is challenging to collect sufficient data and labels in the real world. An alternative solution is to obtain synthetic dense pixel-level labelled data from a driving simulator. Although the use of synthetic data is a promising way to alleviate the labelling problem, models trained with virtual data cannot generalise well to realistic data due to the domain shift. To fill this gap, the authors propose a novel uncertainty-aware generative ensemble method. In particular, ensembles are obtained from different optimisation objectives, training iterations, and network initialisation so that they are complementary to each other to produce reliable predictions. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware ensemble scheme is developed to derive fused prediction by considering the uncertainty from ensembles. Such a design can make better use of the strengths of ensembles to enhance adapted segmentation performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three large-scale datasets.

DE Image denoising; Dual domain; Stein's unbiased risk estimate
ID BILATERAL FILTER
AB Dual domain image denoising (DDID) is an effective denoising method by utilizing bilateral filter (BF) and frequency-based filtering method. DDID-based methods have achieved competitive results compared with state-of-the-art denoising methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the optimal parameter selection of DDID-based methods has less been explored, thus resulting in its sensitiveness to noise level and image content. To address this issue, we study the parameter analysis for DDID, and propose an adaptive DDID via Stein's unbiased risk estimate principle. Specifically, we here drive Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) for DDID to tune the parameters adaptively. The SURE can be used to optimize the parameters by monitoring the mean square error (MSE) of images with additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the SURE principle, we can measure the MSE without access to the noise-free signal (ground truth), thus leading to the optimal parameters in the minimum MSE sense. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the SURE and effectiveness of our SURE-based DDID.

AB Inspired by human brain, the emerging analog-type memristor employed in neuromorphic computing systems has attracted tremendous interest. However, existing analog memristors are still far from accurate tuning of multiple conductance states, which are crucial from the device-level view. Herein, a reliable analog memristor based on ion-slicing single-crystalline LiNbO3 (LNO) thin film is demonstrated. The highly ordered LNO crystal structure provides a stable pathway of oxygen vacancy migration, which is contributed to a stable Mott variable-range hopping process in trap sites. Excellent analog switching characteristics with high reliability and repeatability, including long retention/great endurance with small fluctuation (fluctuated within 0.22%), a large dynamic range of two orders of magnitude, hundreds of distinguishable conductance states with tunable linearity, and ultralow cyclic variances for multiple weight updating (down to 0.75%), are realized with the proposed memristor. As a result, a multilayer perceptron with a high recognition accuracy of 95.6% for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset is realized. The proposed analog memristive devices based on ion-slicing single-crystalline thin films offer a novel strategy for fabricating high-performance memristors that combined linear tunability and long-term repeatability, opening a novel avenue for neuromorphic computing application.

AB The ability to locate and quantify large strains will significantly improve the real-world application scenario of flexible and stretchable strain sensors. However, current methods for implementing stretchable distributed strain sensing still face challenges such as complicated demodulation, multisensor crosstalk, and high power consumption. Herein, a self-powered and stretchable optical fiber strain sensor is reported with distributed sensing capability based on mechanoluminescent optical fiber, where mechanoluminescent phosphors with different emission color light are discretely integrated onto the outer cladding of the elastomer optical fiber. Based on the wavelength coding technique and time-domain filtering comparison method, the capability of strain magnitude quantification (10-60%) and strain location identification together in a single stretchable optical fiber is successfully realized, even at multiple positions simultaneously in the strain-applied situation. Moreover, this stretchable optical fiber strain sensor shows insensitivity to bending, compression, and temperature disturbances and outstanding durability (>8000 cycles). Due to the excellent light confinement of the elastomer optical fiber, demonstrations such as bright-field measurement, saline water operation, and wearable glove application exhibit its potential as a promising technology for future self-powered distributed optical sensing systems.

DT Article
DE image enhancement; image reconstruction; image resolution
AB Despite impressive progress in face super-resolution (SR), it is an open challenge to reconstruct a reliable SR face that preserves authentic facial characteristics. Here, the problem of super-resolving low-resolution (LR) faces to high-resolution (HR) ones is addressed. To tackle the ill-posed nature of face SR, the cascaded super-resolution network (CSRNet) is proposed to utilize shape and identity priors jointly and progressively, the first to explore multiple priors. Specifically, CSRNet adopts a cascaded structure to transform an LR face to HR face progressively via multiple stages. At each stage, CSRNet forces its output face image to match both the shape priors and identity priors extracted from the ground-truth HR face. The shape priors estimated in one stage are merged into the inputs of its subsequent stage to provide rich information for the face SR. To generate realistic yet discriminative faces, the cascaded super-resolution generative adversarial network (CSRGAN) is also proposed to incorporate the adversarial loss and identification loss into CSRNet. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that the CSRNet and CSRGAN outperform existing face SR state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and detailed ablation studies show the advantage of this method.

AB Along with the increase of digitalization and automation, a new kind of working environment is emerging in the field of air traffic control. Instead of situating the control tower at the airport, it is now possible to remotely control the airport at any given location, i.e. in a remote tower center (RTC). However, by controlling the airport remotely, the situational awareness and sense of presence might be compromised. By using directional sound, a higher situational awareness could potentially be achieved while also offloading the visual perception which is heavily used in air traffic control. Suitable use cases for sonification in air traffic control were found through workshops with air traffic controllers. A sonification design named SonAir was developed based on the outcome of the workshops, and was integrated with an RTC simulator for evaluating to what degree SonAir could support air traffic controllers in their work. The results suggest that certain aspects of SonAir could be useful for air traffic controllers. A continuous sonification where the spatial positioning of aircraft were conveyed was experienced to be partially useful, but the intrusiveness of SonAir should be further considered to fit the air traffic controllers' needs. An earcon that conveyed when an aircraft enters the airspace and from which direction was considered useful to support situational awareness.

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB In this study, we propose AID-purifier that can boost the robustness of adversarially-trained networks by purifying their inputs. AID-purifier is an auxiliary network that works as an add-on to an already trained main classifier. To keep it computationally light, it is trained as a discriminator with a binary cross entropy loss. To obtain additionally useful information from the adversarial examples, the architecture design is closely related to the information maximization principle where two layers of the main classification network are piped into the auxiliary network. To assist the iterative optimization procedure of purification, the auxiliary network is trained with AVmixup. AID-purifier can be also used together with other purifiers such as PixelDefend for an extra enhancement. Because input purification has been studied relative less when compared to adversarial training or gradient masking, we conduct extensive attack experiments to validate AID-purifier's robustness. The overall results indicate that the best performing adversarially-trained networks can be enhanced further with AID-purifier.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel Nussbaum-type design to cope with the problem in nonlinear dynam-ical systems with unknown control directions. First, a Nussbaum-based Lyapunov analysis for fixed-time stability is investigated to lay the theoretical foundation. On this basis, the Nussbaum-type adaptive backstepping control is designed with dynamic surface filters to avoid repeated differentiation. To further reduce the computational complexity, an event-triggered mechanism is combined with the Nussbaum-type gain design. With the above design schemes, the practical fixed-time stability of the overall feedback systems can be guaranteed with theoretical discussion. Finally, the feasibility of the presented design is validated by two simulation examples made in the end.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper attempts to develop an intelligent plate fin-and-tube heat exchanger (PFTHE) design system, which is entirely self-programming, to achieve quickly design. The proposed design system consists of four modules: (1) formulation, (2) optimization, (3) post-processing, and (4) decision-making. The proposed design system is implemented and validated with the application of shape optimization of ellipse tubes of plate-fin heat exchanger. In the formulation module, the physical problem to be studied is mathematized and the main design variables will be determined. In the optimization module, a famous algorithm, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm of type II (NSGA-II), is embedded in an in-house Multi-concept Heat Transfer (MHT) code to achieve call CFD simulation during optimization process. To reduce computation time, Open multi-processing (OpenMP) is employed. The optimal solutions (Pareto solutions) obtained by the optimization module will be stored in the database and also taken as the input for the post-processing module and the decision-making module. In the post-processing module, Artificial neural network (ANN) is utilized to establish the correlation between design var-iables and heat transfer performance indicators assisting engineers to quickly design. As a short cut for heat exchanger design, both forward and backward designs have been implemented. Finally, in the decision-making module, technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is applied to determine the best compromise solution from Pareto solutions according to the actual requirements provided by users. Results show that the proposed design system could determine a best compromise solution by reducing the pressure drop (80%) of the tube bundle without sacrificing too much heat transfer performance (5%) and also save much time for designers. For the forward design, the ANNs taken six decision variables as inputs are modelled to forecast two objectives has reached acceptable precisions. This research provides a promising tool for PFTHE optimi-zation to improve heat transfer and comprehensive performance, also for quickly design based on historical simulation or experimental results.

ID DEEP; LEVEL
AB Human-in-the-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) is usually employed to overcome the challenge of sample inefficiency, in which the human expert provides advice for the agent when necessary. The current human-in-the-loop RL (HRL) results mainly focus on discrete action space. In this article, we propose a Q value-dependent policy (QDP)-based HRL (QDPHRL) algorithm for continuous action space. Considering the cognitive costs of human monitoring, the human expert only selectively gives advice in the early stage of agent learning, where the agent implements human-advised action instead. The QDP framework is adapted to the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (TD3) in this article for the convenience of comparison with the state-of-the-art TD3. Specifically, the human expert in the QDP-HRL considers giving advice in the case that the difference between the twin Q-networks' output exceeds the maximum difference in the current queue. Moreover, to guide the update of the critic network, the advantage loss function is developed using expert experience and agent policy, which provides the learning direction for the QDP-HRL algorithm to some extent. To verify the effectiveness of QDP-HRL, the experiments are conducted on several continuous action space tasks in the OpenAI gym environment, and the results demonstrate that QDP-HRL greatly improves learning speed and performance.

DE Unsupervised domain adaptation; Convolutional neural networks;
   Discriminable feature; Adversarial learning
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation addresses the problem of knowledge transformation from source domain to target domain, aiming to effectively alleviate data distribution mismatch and data labeling consumption. The issue of data distribution mismatches is widespread in actual agricultural visual tasks. Moreover, it is expensive and time-consuming to construct and label visual image data. For in-field cotton boll, its maturing status can greatly affect the yield and quality. Uneven distribution restrains the performance for maturing status recognition. Therefore, domain adaptation is essential for identifying cross-domain cotton boll maturity. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation methods obtain domain invariant feature for achieving domain alignment. However, the discriminability of features is less considered, which may result in unsatisfactory classification results. In this paper, an unsupervised domain adaptation method called discriminable feature enhancement (DFE-DA) is proposed to identify cross-domain cotton boll maturity. It enables to minimize intra-class distance by maximizing intra-domain density(MID) loss and realizes discriminable feature enhancement. The effectiveness of DFE-DA is verified on in-field cotton boll V2(IFCB-V2) dataset containing 2400 images. The experimental results demonstrate that DFE-DA has an average improvement of 12.8%, 10.3% and 7.6% compared with other methods in three different transfer tasks. Furthermore, the MID loss can cooperate well with other adversarial methods. To verity the robustness of DFE-DA, additional experiments conducted on the public benchmark Office31 and Office-Home indicates it is comparable to the state-of-the-arts.

AB Ground based radar is a key system for aerial defence of any country. Current generations of radar use Moving Target Indicator (MTI) filter, Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) and Peak Detection (PD) algorithms for detection of target and rejection of non-target (static clutter, dynamic clutter, interference and noise) objects. These conventional Radar Signal Processing (RSP) techniques find their limitation when either targets are not detected or false alarms are generated due to lack of built-in intelligence. In order to eliminate both the issues, a realistic radar environment has been analyzed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Special emphasis has been made on invalid detections caused by weather clutter, which was never worked upon previously using AI. A novel deep learning based object detection approach has been devised keeping radar environment, high accuracy requirement and real-time constraint of radar in view. The proposed approach has been validated for its efficacy through standalone testing as well as Poof of Concept (PoC) implementation on a real radar. Integration of AI model in radar platform also involves a novel implementation scheme, whereby results of AI model are augmented by conventional RSP. Inference time of AI models is a bottleneck for their use in radar systems, in this context, new strategies have also been analyzed to achieve a real-time performance for radar application. As the objective of this research is to devise scalable and effective solutions for upcoming generations of radar; therefore, the work is of practical value for realistic deployments.

AB This paper investigates the problem of switch migration in software defined networking (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV)-based fifth generation (5G) networks in which SDN controllers are deployed as virtualized network functions (VNFs). The problem of switch migration is how to properly transfer the traffic of some SDN switches to one or multiple other virtualized SDN controllers in order to cope with the traffic fluctuations and the changing network topology. The highly dynamic environment of 5G networks requires the simultaneous consideration of multiple conflicting objectives in this problem including controllers load-balancing and network stability. In this paper, this multi-objective problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) which is computationally expensive to solve. Therefore, a mathematical-based solution method is first provided based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique for the single-objective problem in which preference parameters are given to describe associated importance of the objectives. Taking into account the time restrictions for practical developments, an extended deep learning (DL) approach is then proposed to produce multiple mappings over multiple objectives. The verification results show that the proposed multi-objective DL algorithm can generate high quality Pareto Fronts close to those of the state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimization with orders of magnitude speedup in the computational time.

AB Wearable cameras allow to acquire images and videos from the user's perspective. These data can be processed to understand humans behavior. Despite human behavior analysis has been thoroughly investigated in third person vision, it is still understudied in egocentric settings and in particular in industrial scenarios. To encourage research in this field, we present MECCANO, a multimodal dataset of egocentric videos to study humans behavior understanding in industrial-like settings. The multimodality is characterized by the presence of gaze signals, depth maps and RGB videos acquired simultaneously with a custom headset. The dataset has been explicitly labeled for fundamental tasks in the context of human behavior understanding from a first person view, such as recognizing and anticipating human-object interactions. With the MECCANO dataset, we explored six different tasks including (1) Action Recognition, (2) Active Objects Detection and Recognition, (3) Egocentric Human-Objects Interaction Detection, (4) Egocentric Gaze Estimation, (5) Action Anticipation and (6) Next-Active Objects Detection. We propose a benchmark aimed to study human behavior in the considered industrial-like scenario which demonstrates that the investigated tasks and the considered scenario are challenging for state-of-the-art algorithms. To support research in this field, we publicy release the dataset at https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/MECCANO/.

Our system uses Semantic Textual Similarity techniques based on Sentence Transformers models to create pseudo-parallel datasets from a large, non-parallel corpus of lay and expert texts. This approach allowed us to train a denoising autoencoder model (BART), overcoming the limitations of previous systems. Our extensive analysis, which includes both automatic metrics and human evaluations from both lay (patients) and expert (physicians) individuals, shows that our system outperforms state-of-the-art models and is comparable to human-provided gold references in some cases.

AB Forecasting product quality by incorporating customer satisfaction perception factors is an intriguing research area, which can promote the sustainable development of enterprises. To address small-sample random time series data, this study proposes a combined forecasting approach (CFA) for the product quality index that considers perception factors. The proposed approach is based on the support vector regression (SVR) and an improved gray forecasting model (GFM). First, the study constructs a system of perception factors related to defect parts per million (DPPM). Then, the key perception factors (KPF) are selected using the gray entropy relational degree, which is derived from gray relational analysis and information entropy. Then, a multivariable GFM is proposed based on the weighted Markov and the derived form of the gray model to reduce the forecasting error. Finally, a CFA is constructed considering KPF and optimized based on the SVR and the proposed GFM to forecast the DPPM. A case study of liquid crystal display is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CFA. The forecast error of the proposed CFA is 3.2%, which is better than those of GFM, SVR, and ARIMA (4.01%, 6.21%, and 9.89%, respectively). The comparison and discussion of methods demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach for forecasting product quality.

AB Sexism, a form of oppression based on one's sex, manifests itself in numerous ways and causes enormous suffering. In view of the growing number of experiences of sexism reported online, automatically classifying these recollections can aid in the battle against sexism by allowing gender studies researchers and government officials involved in policymaking to conduct more effective analyses. This paper investigates the 23-class fine-grained, multi-label classification of accounts (reports) of sexism. Moreover, we propose a knowledge-based cascaded multi-task framework for fine-grained multi-label sexism classification. We leverage several supporting tasks, including homogeneous and heterogeneous auxiliary tasks. Homogeneous tasks are set up without incurring any manual labeling cost and heterogeneous tasks are set up which have a high correlation with the accounts of sexism. Unlabeled accounts of sexism are utilized through unsupervised learning to help construct our multi-task setup. In addition, we incorporate a knowledge module within the framework to infuse external knowledge features into the learning process. Further, we investigate transfer learning that employs weakly labeled accounts of sexism and transfers the learning to the multi-label sexism classification. We also devise objective functions that exploit label correlations in the training data explicitly. Multiple proposed multi-task methods outperform the state-of-the-art multi-label sexism classification across five standard metrics.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted regular global activities in every possible way. This pandemic, caused by the transmission of the infectious Coronavirus, is characterized by main symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough, and loss of smell. A current key focus of the scientific community is to develop automated methods that can effectively identify COVID-19 patients and are also adaptable for foreseen future virus outbreaks. To classify COVID-19 suspects, it is required to use contactless automatic measurements of more than one symptom. This study explores the effectiveness of using Deep Learning combined with a hardware-emulated system to identify COVID-19 patients in Sri Lanka based on two main symptoms: cough and shortness of breath. To achieve this, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Transfer Learning was employed to analyze and compare the features of a COVID-19 cough with other types of coughs. Real-time video footage was captured using a FLIR C2 thermal camera and a web camera and subsequently processed using OpenCV image processing algorithms. The objective was to detect the nasal cavities in the video frames and measure the breath cycles per minute, thereby identifying instances of shortness of breath. The proposed method was first tested on crowd-sourced datasets (Coswara, Coughvid, ESC-50, and a dataset from Kaggle) obtained online. It was then applied and verified using a dataset obtained from local hospitals in Sri Lanka. The accuracy of the developed methodologies in diagnosing cough resemblance and recognizing shortness of breath was found to be 94% and 95%, respectively.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Magnetic field measurement technologies are extensively applied in nondestructive testing, quality inspection, and fault diagnosis of machines and equipment. Magnetic signals are highly susceptible to noise interference, and how to effectively conduct signal denoising under strong noise disturbance remains a challenge. This study designs a novel auxiliary sensor array comprising center and distributed satellite sensors for magnetic noise reconstruction and signal denoising. The signals of the center and satellite sensors are highly correlative owing to the propagation of the magnetic noise through space. An attention-based long short term memory model is designed and trained to establish the mapping relationship among the center and satellite signals. The noise of the center sensor can then be reconstructed from those of the satellite sensors in the procedure of magnetic field measurement. Finally, the denoised signal of the center sensor is obtained by subtracting the noisy signal with the reconstructed noise. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are validated by experiments and compared with the conventional methods. The designed auxiliary sensor array and algorithm are easily implemented with remarkable robustness, flexibility, and scalability, thereby showing greatly potential use for magnetic signal denoising in a variety of mechatronic systems.

AB The study aims to develop the failure analysis predictive models, which prognosticate first failure event (FFE), failure-to-year ratio (FYR), and failure rectification group (FRG). The construction of predictive models involved nineteen categories of 13,350 units of medical equipment. We proposed thirteen novel features in assessing medical equipment failures. The failure analysis predictive models were categorised into several classes for training and testing the developed models. There was seven supervised machine learning classifiers and performance metrics applied in the experiment. The experiment demonstrates that Support Vector Machine is the best classifier for the FFE predictive model, which achieves an accuracy of 96.9% after hyperparameter optimisation. Furthermore, Decision Tree is the best classifier for FYR, with an accuracy of 83.9%. Meanwhile, the comparative analysis for FRG discovered that Artificial Neural Network achieved the highest accuracy among others with 76.7% accuracy after the hyperparameter optimisation process. Findings from this study indicate that this failure analysis predictive model functions as a main instrument for conducting predictive maintenance in the direction of smart maintenance practices. Through the developed predictive systems, timely maintenance of medical equipment can be performed. This will also assist healthcare service providers in initiating the remanufacturing and refurbishment programme, ensuring efficient medical care delivery. The suggested framework of machine learning-assisted failure analysis for medical equipment maintenance management may provide clinical engineers with guidance for managing the strategic maintenance management for medical equipment.

AB Fault section diagnosis (FSD) is extremely critical to ensure the safe and stable operation of power systems. Neural networks have become popular increasingly in solving this problem and the existing applied ones rely primarily on the traditional BP and RBF neural networks. However, their generalization is weak when diagnosing large-scale power systems. To address this issue, this study suggests a divisional FSD method based on structure adaptive hierarchical extreme learning machines (HELM). To construct an optimal HELM-based sub-module diagnosis model for each subsystem of a large-scale power system, differential evolution is applied to optimize both the number of hidden layer neurons and the regularization factor of HELM simultaneously. The optimal HELM is responsible for completing both the diagnosis of internal power sections of the subsystem and the interim diagnosis of tie lines of adjacent subsystems. Based on the interim diagnosis results, Choquet fuzzy integral is used to fuse them to obtain the final results for the tie lines. Simulation results indicate that the differential evolution algorithm is effective in finding more accurate and compact HELMs with better approximation ability and generalization performance. The proposed FSD method has higher accuracy and fault tolerance to identify various complex fault cases.

AB Hospital patients can have catheters and lines inserted during the course of their admission to give medicines for the treatment of medical issues, especially the central venous catheter (CVC). However, malposition of CVC will lead to many complications, even death. Clinicians always detect the malposition based on position detection of CVC tip via X-ray images. To reduce the workload of the clinicians and the percentage of malposition occurrence, we propose an automatic catheter tip detection framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed framework contains three essential components which are modified HRNet, segmentation supervision module, and deconvolution module. The modified HRNet can retain high resolution features from start to end, ensuring the maintenance of precise information from the X-ray images. The segmentation supervision module can alleviate the presence of other line-like structures such as the skeleton as well as other tubes and catheters used for treatment. In addition, the deconvolution module can further increase the feature resolution on the top of the highest-resolution feature maps in the modified HRNet to get a higher-resolution heatmap of the catheter tip. A public CVC Dataset is utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed algorithm offering a mean Pixel Error of 4.11 outperforms three comparative methods (Ma's method, SRPE method, and LCM method). It is demonstrated to be a promising solution to precisely detect the tip position of the catheter in X-ray images.

AB The fusion of multi-modal data, e.g., medical images and genomic profiles, can provide complementary information and further benefit disease diagnosis. However, multi-modal disease diagnosis confronts two challenges: (1) how to produce discriminative multi-modal representations by exploiting complementary information while avoiding noisy features from different modalities. (2) how to obtain an accurate diagnosis when only a single modality is available in real clinical scenarios. To tackle these two issues, we present a two-stage disease diagnostic framework. In the first multi-modal learning stage, we propose a novel Momentum-enriched Multi-Modal Low-Rank (M3LR) constraint to explore the high-order correlations and complementary information among different modalities, thus yielding more accurate multi-modal diagnosis. In the second stage, the privileged knowledge of the multi-modal teacher is transferred to the unimodal student via our proposed Discrepancy Supervised Contrastive Distillation (DSCD) and Gradient-guided Knowledge Modulation (GKM) modules, which benefit the unimodal-based diagnosis. We have validated our approach on two tasks: (i) glioma grading based on pathology slides and genomic data, and (ii) skin lesion classification based on dermoscopy and clinical images. Experimental results on both tasks demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both multi-modal and unimodal diagnoses.

AB We model cooperative-competitive social group dynamics with multi-agent environments, specialized in cases with a large number of agents from only a few distinct types. The multi-agent optimization problems are addressed in turn with multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to obtain flexible and robust solutions. We analyze the effectiveness of centralized and decentralized algorithms using three variants of deep Q-networks on these cooperative-competitive environments: first, we use the decentralized training independent learning with deep Q-networks, secondly the centralized monotonic value factorizations for deep learning, and lastly the multi-agent variational exploration. We test the algorithms in simulated predator-prey multi-agent environments in two distinct environments: the adversary pursuit and simple tag. The experiments highlight the performance of the different deep Q-learning methods, and we conclude that decentralized training of deep Q-networks accumulates higher episode rewards during training and evaluation in comparison with the selected centralized learning approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Graph classification via discriminative edge feature learning

AB Spectral graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have been producing encouraging results in graph classification tasks. However, most spectral GCNNs utilize fixed graphs when aggregating node features while omitting edge feature learning and failing to get an optimal graph structure. Moreover, many ex-isting graph datasets do not provide initialized edge features, further restraining the ability of learning edge features via spectral GCNNs. In this paper, we try to address this issue by designing an edge fea-ture scheme and an add-on layer between every two stacked graph convolution layers in spectral GCNN. Both are lightweight while effective in filling the gap between edge feature learning and performance enhancement of graph classification. The edge feature scheme makes edge features adapt to node repre-sentations at different spectral graph convolution layers. The add-on layer helps adjust the edge features to an optimal graph structure. To test the effectiveness of our method, we take Euclidean positions as initial node features and extract graphs with semantic information from point cloud objects. The node features of our extracted graphs are more scalable for edge feature learning than most existing graph datasets (in one-hot encoded label format). Three new graph datasets are constructed based on Model-Net40, ModelNet10 and ShapeNet Part datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph classification methods on the new datasets. Our code and the constructed graph datasets will be released to the community.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI AGMN: Association graph-based graph matching network for coronary artery
   semantic labeling on invasive coronary angiograms
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

   Graph matching network
AB Semantic labeling of coronary arterial segments in invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is important for automated assessment and report generation of coronary artery stenosis in computer-aided coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis. However, separating and identifying individual coronary arterial segments is challenging because morphological similarities of different branches on the coronary arterial tree and human-to-human variabilities exist. Inspired by the training procedure of interventional cardiologists for interpreting the structure of coronary arteries, we propose an association graph-based graph matching network (AGMN) for coronary arterial semantic labeling. We first extract the vascular tree from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and convert it into multiple individual graphs. Then, an association graph is constructed from two individual graphs where each vertex represents the relationship between two arterial segments. Thus, we convert the arterial segment labeling task into a vertex classification task; ultimately, the semantic artery labeling becomes equivalent to identifying the artery-to-artery correspondence on graphs. More specifically, the AGMN extracts the vertex features by the embedding module using the association graph, aggregates the features from adjacent vertices and edges by graph convolution network, and decodes the features to generate the semantic mappings between arteries. By learning the mapping of arterial branches between two individual graphs, the unlabeled arterial segments are classified by the labeled segments to achieve semantic labeling. A dataset containing 263 ICAs was employed to train and validate the proposed model, and a five-fold cross-validation scheme was performed. Our AGMN model achieved an average accuracy of 0.8264, an average precision of 0.8276, an average recall of 0.8264, and an average F1-score of 0.8262, which significantly outperformed existing coronary artery semantic labeling methods. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a new algorithm with high accuracy, interpretability, and robustness for coronary artery semantic labeling on ICAs. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

   network; Neural architecture search; Contrastive learning
AB Background: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are vital techniques for synthesizing highfidelity images. Recent studies have applied them to generation tasks under small-data scenarios. Most studies do not directly train GANs on few-shot datasets, which have small data samples; instead, they borrow methods to transfer knowledge from large datasets to GANs with small ones. Partial finetuning of GANs is difficult to ensure the transfer performance, especially when the image domains are of great difference. FastGAN firstly trains GAN with small data samples by a carefully designed skip layer exception (SLE) connection to improve synthesis and an unsupervised discriminator to avoid overfitting. Problem. However, in FastGAN, different designs of SLE connections and operation settings would lead to great differences in synthesis performance. It is necessary to find the most appropriate ways of architecture design. Meanwhile, FastGAN merely improves discriminator learning, but ignores that the generator learning process is also insufficient due to small data samples.Objective: Based on FastGAN, this study aims to find the best generator designs and then improve the training process of it via unsupervised learning. Methods. This work applies a reinforcement learning neural architecture search method to find the optimal GAN architecture and an unsupervised contrastive loss function assisted by a discriminator to optimize generator learning. These two methods constitute our AutoInfoGAN.Results: Experiments were conducted on 11 datasets using AutoInfoGAN, covering a wide range of image domains, achieving better results than state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.Conclusion: The experimental results demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed AutoInfo GAN on few-shot datasets, and we are cautioned that although instance normalization (IN) improves synthesized image quality, it performed poorly in our mode-collapse test.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper is devoted to the issue of observer-based adaptive sliding mode control of distributed delay systems with deterministic switching rules and stochastic jumping process, simultaneously, through a neural network approach. Firstly, relying on the designed Lebesgue observer, a sliding mode hyperplane in the integral form is put forward, on which a desired sliding mode dynamic system is derived. Secondly, in consideration of complexity of real transition rates information, a novel adaptive dynamic controller that fits to universal mode information is designed to ensure the existence of sliding motion in finite-time, especially for the case that the mode information is totally unknown. In addition, an observer-based neural compensator is developed to attenuate the effectiveness of unknown system nonlinearity. Thirdly, an average dwell-time approach is utilized to check the mean-square exponential stability of the obtained sliding mode dynamics, particularly, the proposed criteria conditions are successfully unified with the designed controller in the type of mode information. Finally, a practical example is provided to verify the validity of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FULLY CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS
AB Compared with other kinds of images, aerial images have more obvious object scale distinction and larger resolution, which results in that the whole scale information of aerial images can hardly be explored. To address this difficulty, we develop a novel network based on the digital surface models (DSMs) of aerial images in this paper. The proposed network termed MSINet can efficiently mine scale information through the DSMs from two aspects. Firstly, we propose an interpolation pyramid algorithm to encode the scale information from the DSMs and hence provide a scale prior information to the normal segmentation network. The interpolation pyramid algorithm implements interpolation operations with different scales on the DSMs and detects the pixel value change after the interpolation operations. Objects with different scales will express diverse changes, which provides useful information to encode their scale information. Secondly, aiming to address the problem that the DSMs contain a large amount of noise in the boundary part, a spatial information enhancement module and a mutual-guidance module are developed in this paper. These two modules can fix the misleading guidance information caused by the noise in the boundary part of the DSMs and hence achieve more accurate scale information inserting. The extensive experimental results prove that our methods can outperform other competitors in terms of qualitative and quantitative performance.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Physical cancelable biometrics; Face recognition; Biometric security
AB Cancelable biometrics are designed to solve the problem where biological characteristics cannot be can-celled and reissued. At present, most of the cancelable biometrics are carried out in the digital domain, therefore we call them cancelable biometrics with soft-template. In this paper, we propose a method called Cancelable Biometrics with Physical-Template (CanBiPT). The physical-template is a printed sticker that can be worn on the selected region of the face. First, in the face image, we select a specific region referring to the entropy between the faces with and without the physical-template, i.e., the sticker. Sec-ond, we generate an image with individual features and this image is called the physical-template which can be printed as a sticker. And the sticker is worn on the selected region of the face in the first step and the face with the sticker is used for authentication, recognition and so on. Different physical-templates can be formed by changing the regions (forehead, nose or mouth) or appearance according to the pa-rameters in the algorithm. At the same time, the image printed as the sticker can also be used for the soft-template. The experiments on the public datasets, i.e., LFW and MS-Celeb-1M datasets and our own dataset, i.e., CanBiPT dataset, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method with both physical-templates and soft-templates. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Exit choice is critical to saving lives during a building evacuation. Numerous studies have examined how environmental factors, social interactions, and individuals' internal factors affect exit choice behavior. However, due to their limited ability to perceive and combine these multi-attributes, people do not always make strategic and rational decisions but instead rely on preferences. The choice context can facilitate or hinder the evaluation of attributes, and thus preference reversals may occur in the same choice set but in different contexts. Researchers have long known that the context effect - i.e. preference reversals depending on the availability of other options - plays an important role in decision-making behavior. However, no research on decision-making behavior has been conducted that considers the context effect on exit choice during building evacuation. To fill this gap, we conducted a series of virtual reality (VR) experiments to examine the influence of context effect on exit choice. Before conducting the experiments, the validity of exit choice behavior in the VR-based method was analysed by comparing controlled experiments in both the real world and virtual environment. The results from our VR experiments provide novel and clear empirical evidence that contextual preference reversals involving three major effects, the compromise effect, the similarity effect, and the attraction effect, play an important role in exit choice during evacuation. Additionally, we compared three models for estimating discrete choice - expected utility theory (EUT), cumulative prospect theory (CPT), and accentuation of differences (AOD) - which primarily focus on the option attributes, the risk attitude of decision-makers, and the context of options, respectively. The outstanding performance of AOD, which is based on a psychophysical law and takes into account the impact of the context of options, highlights the psychological perspective of evacuees towards various option attributes and the importance of context effects in exit choice.

AB Tensor discriminant analysis is an important topic in tensor data analysis. However, given the many pro-posals for tensor discriminant analysis methods, there lacks a systematic theoretical study, especially concerning optimality. We fill this gap by providing the minimax lower bounds for the estimation and prediction errors under the tensor discriminant analysis model coupled with the sparsity assumption. We further show that one existing high-dimensional tensor discriminant analysis estimator has matching upper bounds, and is thus optimal. Our results apply to tensors with arbitrary orders and ultra-high di-mensions. If one focuses on one-way tensors (i.e., vectors), our results further provide strong theoretical justifications for several popular sparse linear discriminant analysis methods. Numerical studies are also presented to support our theoretical results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Image analysis and machine learning algorithms operating on multi-gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) often process a large number of tiles (sub-images) and require aggregating predictions from the tiles in order to predict WSI-level labels. In this paper, we present a review of existing literature on various types of aggregation methods with a view to help guide future research in the area of computational pathology (CPath). We propose a general CPath workflow with three pathways that consider multiple levels and types of data and the nature of computation to analyse WSIs for predictive modelling. We categorize aggregation methods according to the context and representation of the data, features of computational modules and CPath use cases. We compare and contrast different methods based on the principle of multiple instance learning, perhaps the most commonly used aggregation method, covering a wide range of CPath literature. To provide a fair comparison, we consider a specific WSI-level prediction task and compare various aggregation methods for that task. Finally, we conclude with a list of objectives and desirable attributes of aggregation methods in general, pros and cons of the various approaches, some recommendations and possible future directions.

AB Quadratic programming with equality constraint (QPEC) problems have extensive applicability in many industries as a versatile nonlinear programming modeling tool. However, noise interference is inevitable when solving QPEC problems in complex environments, so research on noise interference suppression or elimination methods is of great interest. This article proposes a modified noise-immune fuzzy neural network (MNIFNN) model and use it to solve QPEC problems. Compared with the traditional gradient recurrent neural network (TGRNN) and traditional zeroing recurrent neural network (TZRNN) models, the MNIFNN model has the advantage of inherent noise tolerance ability and stronger robustness, which is achieved by combining proportional, integral, and differential elements. Furthermore, the design parameters of the MNIFNN model adopt two disparate fuzzy parameters generated by two fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) related to the residual and residual integral term, which can improve the adaptability of the MNIFNN model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the MNIFNN model in noise tolerance.

AB During the fused magnesia production process (FMPP), there is a demand peak phenomenon that the demand rises first and then falls. Once the demand exceeds its limit value, the power will be cut off. To avoid mistaken power off caused by demand peak, demand peak needs to be forecast, so multistep demand forecasting is required. In this article, we develop a dynamic model of demand based on the closed-loop control system of smelting current in the FMPP. Using the model prediction method, we develop a multistep demand forecasting model consisting of a linear model and an unknown nonlinear dynamic system. Combining system identification with adaptive deep learning, an intelligent forecasting method for furnace group demand peak based on end-edge-cloud collaboration is proposed. It is verified that the proposed forecasting method can accurately forecast demand peak by utilizing industrial big data and end-edge-cloud collaboration technology.

AB This article examines the mechanisms by which aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attacks can exploit vulnerabilities in the TCP/IP transport protocol and its three-way handshake during communication data transmission to hack and cause data loss in networked control systems (NCSs). Such data loss caused by DoS attacks can eventually lead to system performance degradation and impose network resource constraints on the system. Therefore, estimating system performance degradation is of practical importance. By formulating the problem as an ellipsoid-constrained performance error estimation (PEE) problem, we can estimate the system performance degradation caused by DoS attacks. We propose a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function (LKF) using the fractional weight segmentation method (FWSM) to examine the sampling interval and introduce a relaxed, positive definite constraint to optimize the control algorithm. We also propose a relaxed, positive definite constraint that reduces the initial constraints to optimize the control algorithm. Next, we introduce an alternate direction algorithm (ADA) to solve the optimal trigger threshold and design an integral-based event-triggered controller (IETC) to estimate the error performance of NCSs with limited network resources. Finally, we verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method using the Simulink joint platform autonomous ground vehicle (AGV) model.

AB While the whole world struggles with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many different measures taken by countries. In this sense, the distribution of free masks to citizens between the ages of 20-65 in Turkey is one of the important measures taken against to spread of the pandemic. This distribution process is carried out through pharmacies and people can obtain their masks from any pharmacy in their area of residence. However, this situation may cause some pharmacies to be very busy, and thus social distance cannot be maintained and health and safety of the people may be threatened. In this paper, we aim to prioritize pharmacies so that only determined pharmacies in certain regions perform mask distribution process to prevent virus transmission. For this purpose, Esenler district is taken into consideration for a pilot study which is one of the risky regions in terms of virus spread in Istanbul, Turkey. Multi-criteria decision-making approach (MCDM) is used because of the necessity of handling many factors in decision-making process and the contradiction of evaluation factors in the prioritization of pharmacies. In order to best model the uncertainty in the decision process, the MCDM approach is applied in a fuzzy environment. In addition, spherical fuzzy AHP and VIKOR MCDM approaches are used as novel hybrid method in this paper. As a result of spherical fuzzy multi-criteria analysis, the pharmacies that need to provide free mask distribution in the Esenler region have been successfully identified.

AB Deep clustering incorporates embedding into clustering in order to find a lower-dimensional space suitable for clustering tasks. Conventional deep clustering methods aim to obtain a single global embedding subspace (aka latent space) for all the data clusters. In contrast, in this article, we propose a deep multirepresentation learning (DML) framework for data clustering whereby each difficult-to-cluster data group is associated with its own distinct optimized latent space and all the easy-to-cluster data groups are associated with a general common latent space. Autoencoders (AEs) are employed for generating cluster-specific and general latent spaces. To specialize each AE in its associated data cluster(s), we propose a novel and effective loss function which consists of weighted reconstruction and clustering losses of the data points, where higher weights are assigned to the samples more probable to belong to the corresponding cluster(s). Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DML framework and loss function outperform state-of-the-art clustering approaches. In addition, the results show that the DML method significantly outperforms the SOTA on imbalanced datasets as a result of assigning an individual latent space to the difficult clusters.

AB In recent years, agriculture has incorporated various sensors to obtain crop data. Nutrients, conductivity, and pH in soil are the key factors affecting the growth of crops. Before using fertilizers, farmers need to master the soil information of the orchard to decide the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to be fertilized and the amount of water to be irrigated. Although existing outdoor technology sensing solutions can detect soil nutrient information, there are high maintenance costs and systems that do not provide analysis recommendations, which are very unfriendly to farmers. Aiming at the above problems, we propose the fuzzy neural network of fertilization rate and fuzzy neural network of fertilization rate to provide farmers with the most direct fertilization and irrigation suggestions. This paper uses an automated self-propelled soil identification system that enables path planning in an orchard. After arriving at the measurement point designated by the farmer, we use the soil probe measurement system to measure soil nutrients within a certain range. The system provides farmers with suggestions on fertilization and medication and grasps the growth status of the orchard area. The advantage of this is that it can reduce the maintenance cost caused by the long-term installation of the system. The cost of our vehicle-mounted system is 150,000 NT dollars, which saves 350,000 NT dollars a year and 50,000 NT dollars in maintenance costs compared to installing ten outdoor weather station sensors. Compared with fixed weather station solutions, mobile unmanned vehicles can analyze more land areas and bring more precise benefits to farmers.

AB We consider solving distributed constrained optimization in this article. To avoid projection operations due to constraints in the scenario with large-scale variable dimensions, we propose distributed projection-free dynamics by employing the Frank-Wolfe method, also known as the conditional gradient. Technically, we find a feasible descent direction by solving an alternative linear suboptimization. To make the approach available over multiagent networks with weight-balanced digraphs, we design dynamics to simultaneously achieve both the consensus of local decision variables and the global gradient tracking of auxiliary variables. Then, we present the rigorous convergence analysis of the continuous-time dynamical systems. Also, we derive its discrete-time scheme with an accordingly proved convergence rate of $O(1/k)$ . Furthermore, to clarify the advantage of our proposed distributed projection-free dynamics, we make detailed discussions and comparisons with both existing distributed projection-based dynamics and other distributed Frank-Wolfe algorithms.

AB Radiation therapy is a fundamental cancer treatment in the clinic. However, to satisfy the clinical requirements, radiologists have to iteratively adjust the radiotherapy plan based on experience, causing it extremely subjective and time-consuming to obtain a clinically acceptable plan. To this end, we introduce a transformer-embedded multi-task dose prediction (TransMTDP) network to automatically predict the dose distribution in radiotherapy. Specifically, to achieve more stable and accurate dose predictions, three highly correlated tasks are included in our TransMTDP network, i.e. a main dose prediction task to provide each pixel with a fine-grained dose value, an auxiliary isodose lines prediction task to produce coarse-grained dose ranges, and an auxiliary gradient prediction task to learn subtle gradient information such as radiation patterns and edges in the dose maps. The three correlated tasks are integrated through a shared encoder, following the multi-task learning strategy. To strengthen the connection of the output layers for different tasks, we further use two additional constraints, i.e. isodose consistency loss and gradient consistency loss, to reinforce the match between the dose distribution features generated by the auxiliary tasks and the main task. Additionally, considering many organs in the human body are symmetrical and the dose maps present abundant global features, we embed the transformer into our framework to capture the long-range dependencies of the dose maps. Evaluated on an in-house rectum cancer dataset and a public head and neck cancer dataset, our method gains superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art ones. Code is available at https://github.com/luuuwen/TransMTDP.

AB The aim of customer-oriented design concept evaluation (CDCE) is to select the best product design solution from the perspective of customer. Traditionally, most of CDCE methods mainly focus on the customer preference judgement but ignore the confidence attitude of customer, namely, the reliability of preference. However, the customer's uncertain attitude means he is unsure about his decision and could probably change his mind. With the help of Z-number, more complete customer preference information is recorded (Z-preference). The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new Z-preference-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) for CDCE method that retains the confidence coefficient & alpha; in evaluation value (Z-CDCE-& alpha;) to highlight the role of confidence attitude for CDCE, rather than simply translating Z-preference into a regular fuzzy preference value. By integrating with multiple information such as preference value, confidence coefficient & alpha; and the importance rating of design attribute, a novel ideal solution definition (ISD) strategy is put forward. For the re-defined ideal solutions, the distances of alternative to ideal solutions are deduced to get the priority degree & delta; to sort alternatives. According to the proposed ISD strategy of Z-CDCE-& alpha;, the best concept is that its important attribute values are preferred by customers with higher certainty or least preferred by customers with lower certainty, and the customers' preferences and confidence attitudes for its less important attribute values are opposite. A case study and two comparison experiments are carried out to validate the reasonability and feasibility of Z-CDCE-& alpha; for CDCE by comparing with different evaluation values, ISD rules and MCDM models.

AB Fuzzy sets, soft sets and N-soft set are essential concepts for fuzzy modeling, decision making under uncertainty and computational intelligence. Nevertheless, all these models have some limitations imposed on the alternatives and attributes. These mathematical models were unable to handle the situations whenever decision makers need to assign non-binary evaluations to both attributes and alternatives. To overcome these problems, Riaz et al. (Symmetry 13(5):1-31, 2021) proposed the idea of M-parameterized N-soft set (MPNSS), through examining independent non-binary evaluations to both parameters and alternatives. MPNSSs are highly convenient in representation of ambiguous and uncertain data in decision analysis during ranking, rating and grading the objects. The proposed model has greater efficiency to handle the imprecision rather than existing mathematical models. Additionally, we develop multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) techniques on account of M-parameterized N-soft sets (MPNSSs), M-parameterized N-soft aggregation operators (MPNSAO) and M-parameterized N-soft weighted aggregation operators (MPNSWAO). For these objectives, we define fundamental operations on MPNSSs and their properties. Meanwhile, several related results are well proven and some algorithms for MADM are also developed. Moreover, the applications of MADM techniques corresponding to proposed algorithms are explained by illustrative material. To explain the presumption, authenticity and effectiveness of the suggested course of actions, we compared the techniques with few existing MADM methods.

AB Nowadays, many inventory practitioners give special attention to green inventory problems incorporating carbon emission issues throughout the world. In this study, a green inventory model is considered where the demand rate depends on selling price, stock and green concern level. The holding cost is considered a quadratic function of time, and preservation technology has been utilized to control carbon emissions. First of all, a profit maximization crisp model is developed. Then, due to market flexibility, the demand rate assumes uncertainty in nature, where the concept of membership value and nonmembership value exists. So, a fuzzy model is developed where the demand rate is assumed to be a pentagonal intuitionistic dense fuzzy number. A novel defuzzification technique and a solution algorithm have been presented to solve the proposed model. In the numerical illustration, a comparative study is given among crisp and other fuzzy environments. For numerical computation, LINGO 18.0 software has also been utilized. Findings reveal that the green concern is a vital factor for model optimization under uncertain system. Finally, graphical illustration and sensitivity analysis have been made to justify the proposed model.

AB With the considerable achievements of data-hungry deep learning methods in natural language processing tasks, a great amount of effort has been devoted to develop more diverse datasets for different languages. In this paper, we present FarsTail, a new dataset for natural language inference task in Persian language. It includes 10,367 samples which are generated from 3539 multiple-choice questions. A carefully designed multi-step process is adopted to ensure the quality of the dataset. To provide a solid baseline for future research, we also present the results of traditional and state-of-the-art methods on FarsTail, including different embedding methods such as word2vec, fastText, ELMo, BERT, and LASER, as well as different modeling approaches such as DecompAtt, ESIM, HBMP, and ULMFiT. The best obtained test accuracy is 83.38%, which shows that there is a big room for improving the current methods to be useful for real-world NLP applications in different languages. We also investigate the extent to which the models exploit dataset biases in FarsTail, and partition the test set into easy and hard subsets according to the success of biased models. The dataset is available at https://github.com/dml-qom/FarsTail.

AB The effectiveness of the training process significantly impacts the performance of a machine learning (ML) model. The loss function plays an important role during training as it determines the learning curve of the ML model and offers recommendations for enhancing the model's optimization. The choice of the loss function is crucial for models employed in tasks, such as image classification and semantic segmentation. In the process of segmentation, data are extracted from different image features, which can lead to a diminished gradient value that hampers model training, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios using conventional loss functions. Moreover, as the number of classes increases, major objects often overlap minor objects, leading to false and imprecise detection. To address these issues, a dynamic loss function is needed that can self-adjust to handle class imbalance problems. This paper introduces a dynamic loss function that can adjust itself throughout the model's training process, aiming to tackle the issue of class imbalance. Experiments were conducted on three imbalanced medical image datasets to compare the performance of the proposed dynamic loss function with state-of-the-art loss functions using different ML models. The results demonstrate that during the training process proposed dynamic loss function manages to significantly reduce the convergence time of the model by sharply minimizing the loss. Moreover, during validation process these ML models showed improved performance in terms of accuracy, recall and precision.

AB The transparency facilitated by blockchain technology allows anyone on the network to view all the blockchain's data. This feature can be of much use in diabetes management. The daily activities of a diabetic patient need to be monitored to calculate the ideal medicine dosage to be administered. The diabetic patient dataset has different parameters, such as skin thickness, insulin level, blood pressure, diabetes pedigree function, demography, drug intake levels, age, glucose, BMI, and pregnancy, to calculate the dosage level. Diabetic patient activities are collected through a telegram to estimate the right medicine dosage for the diabetic patient accurately. These data obtained from the diabetic patient consist of both clinical and non-clinical information. So, a hybrid algorithm needs to be proposed for classifying diabetic disorders. In this paper, the authors apply hybrid methods such as fuzzy, KNN, neural networks, and multiple linear regressions (MLR) to accurately calculate the ideal medicine dosage for diabetic patients from the diabetic patient dataset. The diabetic patient dataset is fed to a pre-trained neural network algorithm to enhance accuracy. The proposed hybrid algorithm performs better than the other methods regarding regression, response, and accuracy. The accuracy obtained is about 94%, which is higher than other methods.

AB Lung cancer causes millions of deaths annually, and CT scans and lung X-rays are common diagnostic tools. However, large datasets can contain noisy and irrelevant features that can affect the effectiveness of deep learning classification systems. Feature selection is a preprocessing step that can minimize database dimensionality and improve classification accuracy by selecting essential features. In addition, to solve the disadvantage of expensive solution set analysis in the wrapper technique, this study offers an efficient evaluation methodology that significantly decreases the evaluation cost and enhances the efficacy of the feature selection method. Hence, the study proposed a Hybrid Spotted Hyena Optimization with Seagull Algorithm to solve feature selection problems, which efficiently obtained the optimum subset with the largest number of relevant attributes. Biomedical lung data are collected from the LIDC/IDRI and chest X-ray datasets, and the bicubic-interpolation approach is employed to eliminate noise present in the data. We used generative modeling technique, DCGAN, to perform data augmentation. The chosen lung characteristics are evaluated using a hybrid CNN-LSTM, which identified normal and abnormal features in biomedical lung data. The system's efficacy is determined by examining its accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and sensitivity using a Python experimental design. In the LIDC/IDRI database, the proposed classifier achieved a sensitivity of 99.8%, specificity of 99.3%, precision of 99.14%, and accuracy of 99.6%. In the chest X-ray dataset, the classifier achieved a sensitivity of 99.62%, specificity of 97.8%, precision of 97.5%, and accuracy of 99.7%.

AB During the production, transportation and storage of nonwoven fabric mask, there are many damages caused by human or nonhuman factors. Therefore, checking the defects of nonwoven fabric mask in a timely manner to ensure the reliability and integrity, which plays a positive role in the safe use of nonwoven fabric mask. At present, the wide application of machine vision technology provides a technical mean for the defect detection of nonwoven fabric mask. On the basis of the pre-treatment of the defect images, it can effectively simulate the contour fluctuation grading and gray value change of the defect images, which is helpful to realize the segmentation, classification and recognition of nonwoven fabric mask defect features. First, in order to accurately obtain the image information of the nonwoven fabric mask, the binocular vision calibration method of the defect detection system is discussed. On this basis, the defect detection mechanism of the nonwoven fabric mask is analyzed, and the model of image processing based on spatial domain and Hough transform is established, respectively. The original image of the nonwoven fabric mask is processed by region processing and edge extraction. Second, the defect detection algorithm of nonwoven fabric mask is established and the detection process is designed. Finally, a fast defect detection system for nonwoven fabric mask is designed, and the effectiveness of the detection method for nonwoven fabric mask is analyzed with an example. The results show that this detection method has positive engineering significance for improving the detection efficiency of defects in nonwoven fabric mask.

AB Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a prominent research area in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence that has been playing a crucial role in human-computer interaction. The existing FER system focuses on spatial features for identifying the emotion, which suffers when recognizing emotions from a dynamic sequence of facial expressions in real time. Deep learning techniques based on the fusion of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are presented in this paper for recognizing emotion and identifying the relationship between the sequence of facial expressions. In this approach, a hyperparameter tweaked VGG-19 skeleton is employed to extract the spatial features automatically from a sequence of images, which avoids the shortcoming of the conventional feature extraction methods. Second, these features are given into bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) for extracting spatiotemporal features of time series in two directions, which recognize emotion from a sequence of expressions. The proposed method's performance is evaluated using the CK+ benchmark as well as an in-house dataset captured from the designed IoT kit. Finally, this approach has been verified through hold-out cross-validation techniques. The proposed techniques show an accuracy of 0.92% on CK+, and 0.84% on the in-house dataset. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms compared to baseline methods and state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve metrics have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.

AB Wireless image sensor networks (WISNs) collect surveillance images, resulting in copious quantities of data requiring processing and transmission within the network. To reduce and balance energy expenditure during in-network image data processing and transmission, this study introduces an energy-saving strategy based on image super-resolution for WISNs assisted by cloud. The strategy constructs an image data processing and transmission system for WISNs, leveraging cloud infrastructure. By utilizing image quality feedback, the adaptive adjustment of image node sensing resolution is facilitated, minimizing image data transmission volume while ensuring high-quality super-resolution reconstructed image. The establishment of low-overhead, multipath transmission routes enables image nodes to transmit data in blocks, contingent upon neighboring transmission node statuses, thereby equalizing energy consumption for image data transmission. Cloud servers are employed to reconstruct high-resolution images and provide users with surveillance images that satisfy quality requisites. Empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed approach extends the lifetime of WISNs, furnishes users with superior-quality surveillance images, and markedly enhances network monitoring efficacy.

AB In this study, we introduce a new synthetic data generation procedure for augmentation of histopathology image data. This is an extension to our previous research in which we proved the possibility to apply deep learning models for morphological analysis of tumor cells, trained on synthetic data only. The medical problem considered is related to the Ki-67 protein proliferation index calculation. We focused on the problem of cell counting in cell conglomerates, which are considered as structures composed of overlapping tumor cells. The lack of large and standardized data sets is a critical problem in medical image classification. Classical augmentation procedures are not sufficient. Therefore, in this research, we expanded our previous augmentation approach for histopathology images and we proved the possibility to apply it for a cell-counting problem.

   fusion; Reinforcement learning
ID VISUAL NAVIGATION; ROBUST
AB Existing deep reinforcement learning-based mobile robot navigation relies largely on single-modal visual perception to perform local-scale navigation. However, multimodal visual fusion-based global navigation is still under technical exploration. Visual navigation necessitates that agents drive safely in structured, changing, and even unpredictable environments; otherwise, inappropriate operations may result in mission failure and even irreversible damage to life and property. We propose a recurrent deduction deep learning model (RDDRL) for multimodal vision-robot navigation to address these issues. We incorporate a recurrent reasoning mechanism (RRM) into the reinforcement learning model, which allows the agent to store memory, predict the future, and aid in policy learning. Specifically, the RRM first stores current observations and states by learning a parameterized environment model and then predicts future transitions. The RRM then performs a self-assessment on the predicted behavior and perceives the consequences of the current policy, producing a more reliable decision-making process. Furthermore, to obtain global-scale behavioral decision-making, information from scene recognition, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation are fused and used as partial observations of the RDDRL. A large number of simulated experiments based on CARLA scenarios, as well as test results in real-world scenarios, show that RDDRL outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods in terms of driving stability and safety. The results show that by training the agent, the collision rate in the global decision-making of the unmanned vehicle decreases from 0.2 % in the training state to 0.0 % in the test state.

ID INFORMATION
AB Rating prediction is a crucial task for recommender systems, but it has the problem of difficulty in quickly capturing user preference transfer and cold-start problem. Thus, this paper proposes the meta-learning-based rating prediction model for heterogeneous information networks (HIN) called Meta-HRP (HIN-based Rating Prediction) to solve these problems. The model first constructs meta-tasks through meta-paths on HIN and then constructs an embedding representation generator based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and attention mechanism to generate embeddings for users and items. Then the proposed rating prediction meta-learner leverages historical interaction data to learn prior knowledge and rapidly adapts to new items based on a few recent user rating records to timely capture user preference transfer and alleviate the cold-start problem. We validate Meta-HRP with extensive experiments, and the proposed model reduces root mean square error by at least 8.49% on average over the baselines on two public benchmark datasets. Furthermore, Meta-HRP outperforms the state-of-the-arts in most cold-start cases.

   network; Moment exchange; Spatial group attention
AB The fine-grained visual recognition is to classify several sub-categories affiliated to the same basic-level category, which is highly challenging because the same sub-category with large variance and different sub-categories with small variance. Previously approaches generally localize the targets or parts first, then determine which sub-category the image is attached to. They depend on target or part annotations, which are labor-intensive and a barrier to moving towards practical use. Other methods indirectly extract recognizable areas from the high-level feature maps, ignoring the spatial relationships between the target and its parts, which may cause inaccurate recognition. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised spatial group attention network (WSSGA-Net) for fine-grained bird recognition. According to the spatial relationships between the target and its parts, we embed the spatial group attention (SGA) module into the WSSGA-Net to highlight the correct semantic feature regions by establishing a semantic feature space enhancement mechanism. In addition, we apply moment exchange (MoEx) to generate new feature maps by exchanging two input image feature moments for data augmentation. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our approach significantly has a better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches on the standard bird image datasets Bird-65, CUB200-2011 and fine-grained dataset Stanford Cars.

TI Long-tailed image recognition through balancing discriminant quality

DE Long-tailed recognition; Loss reweighting; Discriminant quality;
   Significance of the DQ difference
ID OBJECT
AB Long-tailed image recognition is a challenging task in real scenes with large-scale data. Popular strategies, such as loss reweighting and data resampling, aim to reduce the model bias toward head classes. Specifically, different loss reweighting approaches explore various endogenous or exogenous measures. In this paper, we study a new endogenous measure called discriminant quality (DQ) by considering validation accuracy and discriminant uncertainty. DQ takes advantage of continuous information over a period of time. It is more robust than instantaneous information because of the mitigation of measuring instability caused by random perturbations during training. Additionally, the weight of each class is automatically rebalanced based on DQ. Consequently, the class weight supports the design of a dynamic updating strategy for the significance of the DQ difference. Experiments on MNIST-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT demonstrated the superiority of DQ over state-of-the-art ones in terms of prediction accuracy.

AB A novel neural adaptive integral terminal sliding mode control for decentralized fault-tolerant control strategy, including the integral terminal sliding mode surface, the nonlinear disturbance observer, the radial basis neural network and robust controller, is presented in this paper to achieve fault-tolerant control of modular robot manipulators. First, the integral terminal sliding mode is designed for the fault-tolerant controller. Then, to boost the performance of the controlled system, the radial basis neural network and disturbance observer are introduced to approximate the nonlinear terms and disturbances. The reconstructed approximate uncertainty term is applied as compensation. Next, the super-twisting technique is employed to compensate for estimation errors to ensure stability. In addition, for the actuator saturation problem, the radial basis function neural network-based compensation control is proposed. Finally, the stability of the closed-loop robotic system is demonstrated based on Lyapunov theory. Computer simulations verified the efficiency and advantages of the presented approach.

   segmentation
AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging task of computer vision. The state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods are usually based on the convolutional neural network (CNN), which mainly have the drawbacks of inability to explore the global information correctly and failure to activate potential object regions. To avoid such drawbacks, the transformer approach is explored in the WSSS task, but no effective semantic association between different patch tokens can be determined in the transformer. To address this issue, inspired by the graph convolutional network (GCN), this paper proposes a graph structure to learn the semantic category relationships between different blocks in the vector sequence. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper, a large number of experiments were conducted on the publicly available PASCAL VOC2012 dataset. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement in the WSSS task and outperforms other state-of-the-art transformer-based methods.

DE Session-based recommendation; Volunteer; Graph neural networks; Temporal
   dynamics
AB In large online volunteer systems, inefficiency and low volunteer retention are existing challenges that compromise the success of online communities particularly given the uncertainty in volunteer participation behavior. A strategy that matches volunteers to a host of fields will alleviate these challenges, yet creating an all-in-one volunteer recommendation system is an unexplored but promising area. We propose VolRec, a session-based recommendation for large volunteer networks that employs temporal dynamics to capture uncertainty caused by the changing structure of volunteers' participation behaviour. To optimize the recommendations, we construct a probabilistic volunteer network graph that denotes co-participation in an activity. We then model individual and inferred neighbours' preferences as dynamic and context-aware sessions. VolRec can be adapted to recommend volunteers to organizers, tasks, groups and communities, creating a comprehensive and efficient recommendation system. Experiments using Pioneers data, a mobile based app launched in the wake of Covid-19 to mobilize volunteers and record their participation activities demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.

   constants; Analyticity; Meaning postulates
ID TRUTH; SENSE
AB Our aim is to illuminate the interconnected notions of meaning and truth. For this purpose, we investigate the relationship between meaning theories based on commonsensical 'means that' and interpretive truth theories. The latter are Tarski-Davidson-style truth theories serving as meaning theories. We consider analytically true semantic principles containing 'means' and 'means that' side to side with 'denotes', 'satisfies', and 'true', which constitute the extensional semantic constants of interpretive truth theories. We show that these semantic constants are definable in terms of 'means' and 'means that' operators. The definitions themselves are semantic principles in the role of meaning postulates. We extend a meaning theory based on 'means that' by adjoining semantic principles to the axioms of the theory. Then, all axioms, hence all theorems, of a corresponding interpretive truth theory are provable in the extension of the meaning theory. Furthermore, every interpretive truth theory can be included in the extension of a corresponding meaning theory. Therefore, the extension of a meaning theory resulting from the adjunction of semantic principles constitutes a unified meaning-and-truth theory since it includes both a meaning theory and an interpretive truth theory.

ID EVENT DETECTION
AB Video anomaly detection is the study of detecting low probability anomalies from high probability normal behaviour. The imbalance of data raises the need to effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviour in foreground targets. In the current state of research, the focus of many researchers has been on predictions closer to acquisition, but this need to effectively distinguish between normal and abnormal has received little attention. To address this problem, we propose a spatio-temporal enhancement network, a prediction-based unsupervised learning approach to video anomaly detection. In order to capture similar properties between foreground targets, we design the correlation enhancement module, which aims to quantify the spatial information of normal foreground targets. The temporal information enhancement module is also designed to stabilise the temporal information of normal foreground targets to reduce the effect of background variation and improve the robustness of the network structure. To clarify the boundary between normal and abnormal targets, a poorer substitution is represents the abnormal target feature vector, a superior substitution is represents the normal target feature vector. In this way, to obtain a clear and accurate locus of the abnormal occurrence time. We have extensively test on the UCSD Ped1, UCSD Ped2, and Avenue datasets and obtained desirable average AUC metrics of 82.7, 97.6, and 89.6, respectively.

AB This study proposes a method based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) to identify migratory birds from their songs, with the objective of recognizing which birds pass through certain areas and at what time. To determine the best FCN architecture, extensive experimentation was conducted through a grid search, exploring the optimal depth, width, and activation function of the network. The results showed that the optimal number of filters is 400 in the widest layer, with 4 convolutional blocks with maxpooling and an adaptive activation function. The proposed FCN offers a significant advantage over other techniques, as it can recognize the sound of a bird in audio of any length with an accuracy greater than 85%. Furthermore, due to its architecture, the network can detect more than one species from audio and can carry out near-real-time sound recognition. Additionally, the proposed method is lightweight, making it ideal for deployment and use in IoT devices. The study also presents a comparative analysis of the proposed method against other techniques, demonstrating an improvement of over 67% in the best-case scenario. These findings contribute to advancing the field of bird sound recognition and provide valuable insights into the practical application of FCNs in real-world scenarios.

AB Neutrosophic data envelopment analysis (Neu-DEA) is a mathematical tool for calculating the performance of decision-making units (DMUs) in a neutrosophic environment. In this paper, a novel ranking function is developed specifically for single-valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTrNNs). The properties of this new ranking function have also been extensively studied. We develop the Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes models in the context of SVTrNNs to measure the efficiency of homogeneous DMUs. Additionally, we propose a unique solution process by incorporating the newly developed ranking function, which allows for the conversion of the neutrosophic DEA model into a corresponding Crisp LP model. This approach offers an efficient and effective tool of measuring the DMU efficiency in a neutrosophic environment. The reference set or peer group is defined for inefficient DMUs, which enables them to improve their efficiency score by following their peers. Two different approaches are suggested as potential ways to completely rank the DMUs, i.e., the reference set- and the super-efficiency-score-based ranking approaches. The validity and existence of the proposed models are demonstrated by providing an illustrative example, and the results are compared to an existing approach. The proposed Neu-DEA model is employed to assess the efficiency of the 12 major seaports in India, and it yields superior outcomes compared to the currently existing models.

AB Unsupervised feature selection, aiming at finding a refined representation of the original data by filtering out irrelevant and redundant features, has attracted intensive attention. Due to the dilemma of unavailable labels, existing methods select relevant features that preserve the intrinsic structure of data. Despite they are proven effective, the fixed metric is utilized to measure the distances from the projected samples to the target representation in the reconstruction term, which means that existing methods can not possess sufficient flexibility to adapt to different types of data sources. Besides, conventional methods utilize the l(2) norm based Laplacian graph to preserve the local structure of data, which leads to the sensitivity to noisy data. Inspired by the effectiveness and flexibility of the l(2,p) norm metric, we propose adaptive unsupervised feature selection with robust graph regularization (AUFS). Specifically, we impose the l(2,p) norm on the feature reconstruction term, which enhance the adaptability of our method to different types of data sources by adjusting p. In addition, l(2,1) norm based Laplacian graph is designed to alleviate the negative impact of noisy data. To solve the optimization problem, a unified iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence is proposed. A large number of experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms some latest and related methods.

AB Some types of software systems, like event-based and non-deterministic ones, are usually specified as rules so that we can analyse the system behaviour by drawing inferences from firing the rules. However, when the fuzzy rules are used for the specification of non-deterministic behaviour and they contain a large number of variables, they constitute a complex form that is difficult to understand and infer. A solution is to visualise the system specification with the capability of automatic rule inference. In this study, by representing a high-level system specification, the authors visualise rule representation and firing using fuzzy coloured Petri-nets. Already, several fuzzy Petri-nets-based methods have been presented, but they either do not support a large number of rules and variables or do not consider significant cases like (a) the weight of the premise's propositions in the occurrence of the rule conclusion, (b) the weight of conclusion's proposition, (c) threshold values for premise and conclusion's propositions of the rule, and (d) the certainty factor (CF) for the rule or the conclusion's proposition. By considering cases (a)-(d), a wider variety of fuzzy rules are supported. The authors applied their model to the analysis of attacks against a part of a real secure water treatment system. In another real experiment, the authors applied the model to the two scenarios from their previous work and analysed the results.

AB The proportional-integral regulator is one of the most famous and widely used linear controllers in the industrial field because of its easy adjustment of the results, simplicity, and inexpensive. The negative of this controller is that it is affected by the change of system parameters, which causes several problems, including the high value of ripples and low quality of the power/current. To reduce this defect, a new proportional-integral regulator is suggested based on the use of the terminal sliding surface technique and genetic algorithm. This suggested nonlinear controller is discussed for the first time in this work to use it to ameliorate the quality of energy output from a dual-rotor wind power system using an induction generator. The use of a new controller to regulate the generator energy will inevitably lead to an increase in power errors, power ripples, and harmonic distortion of current especially if the system parameters are changed. Also, the traditional direct power control based on the proposed nonlinear controllers of the induction generator is a robust control, does not need the mathematical form of the generator, is simple, and does not need a specialist. Moreover, the suggested method is applied to the rotor inverter of the 1.5 MW generator using Matlab software. The suggested technique takes full advantage and the power regulation objective of the suggested power system is confirmed by the numerical results compared to the conventional technique and other published controls.

AB Kinetic model identification relies on accurate concentration measurements and physical constraints to limit solution multiplicity. Not having these measurements and prior knowledge of species and reactions creates considerable challenges that are currently unresolved. We address these by developing a data-driven framework using realtime spectroscopic data, comprising: (i) multivariate curve resolution to deconvolve the spectra of the reacting mixture into those of its pseudocomponents and their corresponding concentrations, which enables species identification without prior information, (ii) Bayesian structure learning among the pseudocomponent spectra to enable hypothesizing reaction pathways, and (iii) neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) that are physically constrained by the hypothesized reaction network and the laws of mass action and temperature dependence to learn kinetic models from the temporal concentration projections of the realtime spectra. The predictive performance of the constrained neural ODEs is limited by the accuracy of spectral deconvolution in the presence of noise, and has been benchmarked against a constrained regression approach by varying signal:noise ratios in the synthetic spectroscopic data of reacting mixtures. Although the hypothesized reaction network differs from the actual reaction template, owing to noise, the network-constrained neural ODEs are seen to result in a 75.2% and 68.15% decrease in the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the concentration profile predictions as compared to the constrained regression method, when trained on time projected concentration data of the synthetic spectra generated at a signal to noise ratio of 35 and 100, respectively.

ID IMAGE; RECOGNITION
AB Deep learning based pipelines for semantic segmentation often ignore structural information available on annotated images used for training. We propose a novel post-processing module enforcing structural knowledge about the objects of interest to improve segmentation results provided by deep neural networks (DNNs). This module corresponds to a "many-to-one-or-none"inexact graph matching approach, and is formulated as a quadratic assignment problem. Our approach is compared to a DNN-based segmentation on two public datasets, one for face segmentation from 2D RGB images (FASSEG), and the other for brain segmentation from 3D MRIs (IBSR). Evaluations are performed using two types of structural information: distances and directional relations that are user defined, this choice being a hyper-parameter of our proposed generic framework. On FASSEG data, results show that our module improves accuracy of the DNN by about 6.3% i.e. the Hausdorff distance (HD) decreases from 22.11 to 20.71 on average. With IBSR data, the improvement is of 51% better accuracy with HD decreasing from 11.01 to 5.4. Finally, our approach is shown to be resilient to small training datasets that often limit the performance of deep learning methods: the improvement increases as the size of the training dataset decreases.

AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a kind of fine-grained task that predicts sentiment polarities for the given aspects in a sentence. Recently, graph-based methods such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph attention networks (GATs) and their extensions have been used to model the syntactic structures of sentences and have achieved promising results. However, these graph-based methods generally homogenize dependencies and result in the loss of syntactic information. In addition, models that use only syntax-based graph methods are unable to identify the sentiments in informal reviews. In this study, we propose a dependency feature-aware hierarchical dual-graph convolutional network (HD-GCN) model, which consists of two specifically designed GCNs for extract-ing syntactic and semantic information. Specifically, for semantic information extraction, we leverage a self-attention matrix to represent the correlations between nodes. For syntactic information, we design a dependency feature-aware GCN that adaptively learns the mappings of various dependencies in the adjacency matrix. Moreover, we stack the network into multiple layers, and each layer learns different relation matrices to better obtain different levels of linguistic features. Extensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets, and the obtained experimental results are superior to those of the state-of-the-art models on the ABSA task, proving the effectiveness of our model.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Abdominal multi-organ segmentation in multi-sequence magnetic resonance images (MRI) is of great significance in many clinical scenarios, e.g., MRI-oriented pre-operative treatment planning. Labeling multiple organs on a single MR sequence is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, let alone manual labeling on multiple MR sequences. Training a model by one sequence and generalizing it to other domains is one way to reduce the burden of manual annotation, but the existence of domain gap often leads to poor generalization performance of such methods. Image translation-based unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a common way to address this domain gap issue. However, existing methods focus less on keeping anatomical consistency and are limited by one-to-one domain adaptation, leading to low efficiency for adapting a model to multiple target domains. This work proposes a unified framework called OMUDA for one-to-multiple unsupervised domain-adaptive segmentation, where disentanglement between content and style is used to efficiently translate a source domain image into multiple target domains. Moreover, generator refactoring and style constraint are conducted in OMUDA for better maintaining cross-modality structural consistency and reducing domain aliasing. The average Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of OMUDA for multiple sequences and organs on the in-house test set, the AMOS22 dataset and the CHAOS dataset are 85.51%, 82.66% and 91.38%, respectively, which are slightly lower than those of CycleGAN(85.66% and 83.40%) in the first two data sets and slightly higher than CycleGAN(91.36%) in the last dataset. But compared with CycleGAN, OMUDA reduces floating-point calculations by about 87 percent in the training phase and about 30 percent in the inference stage respectively. The quantitative results in both segmentation performance and training efficiency demonstrate the usability of OMUDA in some practical scenes, such as the initial phase of product development.

AB This paper proposes an approach based on neural networks for designing near-optimal 3D trajectories connecting two points separated by obstacles. A reference path is first built with a novel Theta* algorithm implementation, upgraded to reduce the number of waypoints and the angular variations. Starting from the path, a trajectory based on piecewise Bezier curves is designed with an algorithm relying on two design parameters. The optimal value of these parameters is estimated with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture receiving as inputs an image of the path and its properties. The CNN training is performed on a synthetic dataset of optimal parameters built with Differential Evolution optimization for a variety of randomly generated paths. The parameters from CNN are refined with an algorithm capable of providing with high success rate near-optimal trajectories within minimum computation time.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Semantic segmentation using RGB and thermal images is crucial in a variety of applications, including autonomous driving and video surveillance. However, the validity of information differs between modalities, which is typically addressed by weighting image features using complex and inefficient networks. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-Expert Fusion Network (MEFNet) that decouples the three-dimensional attention matrix of image features into a two-dimensional modal weight matrix and a channel attention vector. This approach focuses more on modal and channel differences while excluding interferences from other factors. Specifically, MEFNet multiplies RGB and thermal features by their respective modal weights, and then uses channel attention to select important feature channels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MEFNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 62.6% mIoU on the IR SEG dataset.

AB Recent developments in multiagent consensus problems have heightened the role of network topology when the agent number increases largely. The existing works assume that the convergence evolution typically proceeds over a peer-to-peer architecture where agents are treated equally and communicate directly with perceived one-hop neighbors, thus resulting in slower convergence speed. In this article, we first extract the backbone network topology to provide a hierarchical organization over the original multiagent system (MAS). Second, we introduce a geometric convergence method based on the constraint set (CS) under periodically extracted switching-backbone topologies. Finally, we derive a fully decentralized framework named hierarchical switching-backbone MAS (HSBMAS) that is designed to conduct agents converge to a common stable equilibrium. Provable connectivity and convergence guarantees of the framework are provided when the initial topology is connected. Extensive simulation results on different-type and varying-density topologies have shown the superiority of the proposed framework.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Precise crop classification plays a significant role in the agriculture field. An appropriate data source for precise crop classification is high spatial resolutions hyperspectral imagery (H2 imagery) acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, for imagery with many different classes of crops, crop classi-fication of UAV H2 imagery is a huge challenge. The significant spectral diversity, spatial heterogeneity and nonlinear data structure of UAV H2 imagery results in poor spectral discriminability. To improve the discriminability, a kernel tensor slice sparse coding-based classifier (KTSSCC) is proposed for precise crop classification of UAV H2 imagery in this research. The kernel tensor representation mechanism in KTSSCC can reduce the nonlinear separation while well preserving the spectral characteristics and spatial constraints of land-covers, and thus the discriminability is greatly improved. Furthermore, this paper puts forward the kernel tensor slice sparse orthogonal matching pursuit (KTSSOMP) algorithm to opti-mize kernel tensor slice sparse coding in the spectral space, which greatly reduces the computation cost. Moreover, there are very few parameters to be tuned in our proposed model. We assess the performance of KTSSCC on two real UAV hyperspectral imagery datasets, and find that, based on visual and quantita-tive results, it provides satisfactory crop classification results and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The slime mould algorithm (SMA) is a population-based optimization algorithm that mimics the foraging behavior of slime moulds with a simple structure and few hyperparameters. However, SMA has some limitations, such as getting trapped in local optima when dealing with multimodal or combinatorial functions. To overcome these limitations and improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation abilities, a local dimensional mutation strategy and an all-dimensional neighborhood search strategy for SMA, known as LASMA, were introduced. To evaluate the performance of LASMA, experiments were conducted on 30 benchmark functions from the CEC2014 competition, and the results were compared with up to 27 peers. The experimental results were then synthesized, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the performance of LASMA. The results showed that LASMA outperformed other algorithms in terms of solution accuracy, stability, and convergence speed, with at least a 53.3% improvement in optimization performance on the 30 tested functions. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of LASMA to feature selection problems, a binary version of LASMA called bLASMA was developed and compared with eight binary classification algorithms on 18 datasets from the UCI repository. The experimental results showed that bLASMA not only had faster convergence speed and higher convergence accuracy in handling optimization problems but also performed well in feature selection applications. Thus, LASMA is a promising optimization tool for handling global and binary optimization problems, and its binary version, bLASMA, can be used for feature selection tasks. By addressing the limitations of SMA and improving the algorithm's exploration and exploitation abilities, LASMA provides a robust and effective solution for various optimization problems.

DE Action anticipation; Egocentric vision; Streaming perception
AB Egocentric action anticipation aims to predict the future actions the camera wearer will perform from the observation of the past. While predictions about the future should be available before the predicted events take place, most approaches do not pay attention to the computational time required to make such predictions. As a result, current evaluation schemes assume that predictions are available right after the input video is observed, i.e., presuming a negligible runtime, which may lead to overly optimistic evaluations. We propose a streaming egocentric action evaluation scheme which assumes that predictions are performed online and made available only after the model has processed the current input segment, which depends on its runtime. To evaluate all models considering the same prediction horizon, we hence propose that slower models should base their predictions on temporal segments sampled ahead of time. Based on the observation that model runtime can affect performance in the considered streaming evaluation scenario, we further propose a lightweight action anticipation model based on feed-forward 3D CNNs which is optimized using knowledge distillation techniques with a novel past-to-future distillation loss. Experiments on the three popular datasets EPIC-KITCHENS-55, EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ show that (i) the proposed evaluation scheme induces a different ranking on state-of-the-art methods as compared to classic evaluations, (ii) lightweight approaches tend to outmatch more computationally expensive ones, and (iii) the proposed model based on feed-forward 3D CNNs and knowledge distillation outperforms current art in the streaming egocentric action anticipation scenario.

AB The performance of Capacitive Voltage Transformer (CVT) degrades over time, making measurement error monitoring a research hotspot in the field of smart grid. At present, these are several challenges such as complex data features, a lack of criteria for selecting optimal measurement models, and low precision. CVT measurement errors can be classified into ideal error and additional one. The former is typically evaluated via mutual information and redundancy within the topology-level transformer group. Considering that a single model cannot process the time series, strong randomness and nonlinearity of the additional error, the Stacking model is selected. Based on the principle of heterogeneity and high-quality, correlation coefficient and feature contribution degree, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Ridge Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory are chosen as base learners through correlation and feature contribution analysis; while extra-trees with strong generalization and robustness is chosen as the meta learner. To improve the measurement precision, the attention-like mechanism is used to scale time and accuracy weights. Finally, according to the power domain knowledge, a linear superposition model is developed to fuse the ideal and additional errors, and thus realize online error measurement for CVTs. The experimental results indicate that the improved Stacking model outperforms mainstream measurement models by an average reduction of 59.47%, and 52.58% in the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error with the best R2 closest to 1. It not only effectively improves the accuracy but also meets speed requirement for online error measurement.

AB To adapt to the uncertainty of the real environment and solve the problem of high efficiency and high quality, this study comprehensively considers a variety of uncertainty factors, focusing on modeling and solving a hybrid flow-shop scheduling problem by two-stage stochastic programming (HFSP-TSP). First, this paper uses a twostage scenario tree to describe the uncertain factors, the probabilities and values are obtained under different discrete production scenarios, and stochastic programming theory is used to formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for HFSP-TSP. Second, based on a general discrete optimization algorithm framework, that is, pointer-based discrete differential evolution (PDDE) algorithm, a novel variant (H-PDDE) is proposed for effectively solving the HFSP-TSP. It adopts a permutation scheduling decoding method and introduces three new improvement strategies: the strategy of inconsistent code length of individuals in the population, adding local search in discrete mutation operation, using a heuristic algorithm to generate the initial population. Finally, computational experiments were conducted to illustrate the proposed mathematical model and optimization algorithm. The computational results show that the H-PDDE can solve the HFSP-TSP more effectively than existing algorithms and conventional PDDE variants. The stochastic programming model is increasingly superior to the deterministic model in an uncertain environment. The source code of the H-PDDE algorithm and its data files can be found at https://github.com/huangyiping-ai/H-PDDE-algorithm.git, which is publicly available.

AB Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on seven technical requirements sustained over three main pillars that should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: it should be (1) lawful, (2) ethical, and (3) robust, both from a technical and a social perspective. However, attaining truly trustworthy AI concerns a wider vision that comprises the trustworthiness of all processes and actors that are part of the system's life cycle, and considers previous aspects from different lenses. A more holistic vision contemplates four essential axes: the global principles for ethical use and development of AI-based systems, a philosophical take on AI ethics, a risk-based approach to AI regulation, and the mentioned pillars and requirements. The seven requirements (human agency and oversight; robustness and safety; privacy and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal and environmental wellbeing; and accountability) are analyzed from a triple perspective: What each requirement for trustworthy AI is, Why it is needed, and How each requirement can be implemented in practice. On the other hand, a practical approach to implement trustworthy AI systems allows defining the concept of responsibility of AI-based systems facing the law, through a given auditing process. Therefore, a responsible AI system is the resulting notion we introduce in this work, and a concept of utmost necessity that can be realized through auditing processes, subject to the challenges posed by the use of regulatory sandboxes. Our multidisciplinary vision of trustworthy AI culminates in a debate on the diverging views published lately about the future of AI. Our reflections in this matter conclude that regulation is a key for reaching a consensus among these views, and that trustworthy and responsible AI systems will be crucial for the present and future of our society.

DE Semi -supervised learning; Class-imbalanced learning; Graph network;
   Label propagation; MixUp
AB Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed resounding success in many standard class-balanced bench-mark datasets. However, real-world data often exhibit class-imbalanced distributions, which poses sig-nificant challenges for existing SSL algorithms. In general, fully supervised models trained on a class-imbalanced dataset are biased toward the majority classes, and this issue becomes more severe for class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning (CISSL) conditions. To address this issue, we put forward a novel CISSL framework dubbed FGBC by introducing a flexible graph-based balanced classifier with three in-novations. Specifically, because the propagation of label information becomes difficult for tail classes, we propose a graph-based classifier head attached to the representation layer of the existing SSL framework for efficient pseudo-label propagation. Then, by considering that the learning status of different classes in CISSL may vary, we introduce a flexible threshold adjustment in pseudo-labeling to further select bal-anced samples to participate in training. Furthermore, to alleviate the risk of overfitting tail classes, we devised a class-aware feature MixUp (CFM) augmentation algorithm, which can further enhance the fea-tures of each class by considering their class sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that FGBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets from CIFAR-10/100, SVHN and Small ImageNet-127 under vari-ous levels of CISSL conditions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Limited by the size, location, number of samples and other factors of the small object itself, the small object is usually insufficient, which degrades the performance of the small object detection algorithms. To address this issue, we construct a novel Feature Enhancement Network (FENet) to improve the per-formance of small object detection. Firstly, an improved data augmentation method based on collision detection and spatial context extension (CDCI) is proposed to effectively expand the possibility of small object detection. Then, based on the idea of Granular Computing, a multi-granular deformable convolu-tion network is constructed to acquire the offset feature representation at the different granularity levels. Finally, we design a high-resolution block (HR block) and build High-Resolution Block-based Feature Pyramid by parallel embedding HR block in FPN (HR-FPN) to make full use different granularity and res-olution features. By above strategies, FENet can acquire sufficient feature information of small objects. In this paper, we firstly applied the multi-granularity deformable convolution to feature extraction of small objects. Meanwhile, a new feature fusion module is constructed by optimizing feature pyramid to maintain the detailed features and enrich the semantic information of small objects. Experiments show that FENet achieves excellent performance compared with performance of other methods when applied to the publicly available COCO dataset, VisDrone dataset and TinyPerson dataset.

AB Recently machine learning (ML) based approaches have gained significant attention in dealing with computationally intensive analyses such as uncertainty quantification of composite laminates. However, high-fidelity ML model construction is computationally demanding for such high-dimensional problems due to the required large amount of high-fidelity training data. We propose to address this issue effectively through multi-fidelity ML based surrogates which can use a training dataset consisting of optimally distributed high-and low-fidelity simulations. For forming multi-fidelity surrogates of progressive damage in composite laminates, we combine low-fidelity finite element analysis data obtained using Matzenmiller damage model with Hasin failure criteria and high-fidelity finite element analysis data obtained using three-dimensional continuum damage mechanics based model with P Linde's failure criteria. It is shown that there is a significant computational advantage to using the multi-fidelity surrogate approach as compared to conventional single-fidelity surrogates. Such computational advantage through optimal data fusion without compromising accuracy becomes crucial for the subsequent data-driven uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of composites involving thousands of realizations. Ply orientations come out to be the most sensitive parameters to matrix damage, fibre damage and reaction force in composite laminates. The degree of uncertainty in the output quantities depend on the input level stochastic variations. For example, a combined stochastic variation of & PLUSMN;10% in material properties and & PLUSMN;10 degrees in ply orientations lead to 1.85%, 16.98% and 11.24% coefficient of variation in the matrix damage, fibre damage and reaction force respectively. In general, the numerical results obtained based on the efficient data driven approach strongly suggest that source-uncertainty of composites significantly influences the progressive damage evolution and global mechanical behaviour, leading to the realization of the importance of adopting an inclusive analysis framework considering such inevitable random variabilities.

AB The improvement of medical technology is closely related to the development of computers. Deep learning methods have become an important means for medical image processing, and their accuracy in processing lesions will have a significant impact on the final diagnosis result. Currently, some traditional algorithms and classical deep learning methods are no longer able to meet the increasing demand for higher accuracy in medical image processing. In order to achieve better performance in handling the edge and detail features of lesions, we create the Deep Supervision Feature Refinement Attention Network (DSFRA-Net) through extensive experiments. In DSFRA-Net, the Depth Feature Attention Block is created to enhance the long-range dependency between pixels in deep neural networks. The Feature Refinement Block is developed to enhance the details in shallow features. The Adaptive Feature Extraction Block is created to strengthen the fusion of semantic information and detail information. A deep supervision mechanism is used to supervise each layer of the feature reconstruction process, feeding back the training in the form of a loss function to optimize the training. DSFRA-Net experiments on four datasets, all of which show better performance than the current mainstream networks. It shows superior capabilities in areas such as feature continuity and detailed feature processing.

AB Most domain adaptation methods for fault diagnosis depend heavily on the precondition that the source and target domain have an identical label space, which is hard to be satisfied in industrial sites. Recently, many approaches have been developed to implement partial domain adaptation. However, most existing methods adopt classic convolutional neural network as the feature extractor, which limits the ability to learn discriminative representations from non-stationary vibration signals of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. Moreover, the design of multiple subdomain adaptation will cause complex network structure with many source classes. To address these problems, this paper proposes a partial domain adaptation scheme based on weighted adversarial nets with improved convolutional block attention module (CBAM) for WT gearbox unsupervised fault diagnosis. In detail, a residual convolutional network combining the improved CBAM is designed to extract finer domain discriminative features for knowledge transfer. Meanwhile, a weighting mechanism based on the two-stage domain discriminator is designed to evaluate the contribution of each source sample, through which a simplified transfer network structure is constructed and the source samples unrelated to the target domain can be filtered. Furthermore, an adversarial transfer strategy is introduced to decrease the distribution discrepancy between domains, then the helpful diagnosis knowledge can be transferred. Experiments on two cases demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method compared with existing domain adaptation methods.

AB The Dwarf Mongoose Optimization Algorithm (DMO) is a popular metaheuristic algorithm utilized to solve real-world problems. However, DMO has limitations such as slow convergence rate, susceptibility to local optima, and poor performance in high-dimensional problems. Aiming at the defects of the DMO, we propose an improved version called IDMO. This paper introduces the best leader and proposes a novel nonlinear control strategy based on the sine function, significantly enhancing the convergence rate while ensuring accuracy. Moreover, we propose a novel exploration strategy to solve the global optimization and high-dimensional problem. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed IDMO, we test on 65 test functions, including CEC2017, CEC2020, CEC2022, and CEC2013 large-scale global optimization. IDMO is compared with three classes of widely recognized algorithms: (1) highly-cited algorithms, namely, GSA, GWO, WOA, and HHO, (2) advanced algo-rithms, such as CPSOGSA, CSA, AVOA, and SO, (3) high-performance optimizers including L-SHADE, AL-SHADE, LSHADE-SPACMA, and LSHADE-cnEpSin. Moreover, we also compare with the original DMO and variants such as GDNNMOA, CO-DWO, and BDMOSAO. Meanwhile, we apply IDMO to solve 19 engineering design problems from the CEC2020 real-world optimization suite. Experimental results demonstrate that IDMO outperforms other algorithms, exhibiting excellent convergence rate, stability, and accuracy. The effectiveness of IDMO is confirmed by the Friedman mean ranking, showcasing its potential for metaheuristic optimization and real-world engineering design problems.

DE Deep neural networks; Structured pruning; Pruning criteria
AB Structured pruning is a well-established technique for compressing neural networks, making them suitable for deployment in resource-limited edge devices. This study presents an efficient loss-aware automatic selection of structured pruning (LAASP) criteria for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methods employ a sequential process consisting of three stages, 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52%. Furthermore, pruning the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42% with a negligible 0.33% drop in the top-5 accuracy.

ID SELECTION
AB Knowledge graphs typically suffer from incompleteness due to construction defects and therefore need to be complemented by reasoning methods to facilitate advanced applications. Although many approaches have been proposed to address knowledge graph reasoning, they are heuristic and limited by the search quality and quantity of paths between entities. Inspired by variational inference and reinforcement learning, this paper proposes a variational reinforcement network (termed VRNet), which aims to infer new relation by fusing the information found on the paths connecting a pair of entities to complete the knowledge graph. Specifically, we assume that the direct relation between two entities can be inferred by multiple paths, which are likely to be multi-hop and modeled by Markov chains. We introduce latent variables to bridge the paths and relation, and design a multi-class classifier and score functions to determine the relations. Instead of traversing all the paths, we use the variational approach combined with reinforcement learning to search necessary paths with relational discrimination information. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets indicate that VRNet integrates information from different paths and has achieved competitive performances in relation reasoning tasks.

AB Transfer learning aims to apply previously learned knowledge to new unknown domains by mining the potential relationships between data from different domains. Because of its ability to process data from different domains, the projection transfer learning methods have attracted much attention. However, most of the methods only focus on the reconstruction between different domains and do not fully use the data. Here, we put forward a novel transfer learning method called low-rank constraint-based multiple projections learning (LRMPL) for cross-domain classification. LRMPL works on both the overall reconstruction of two domains and aligns the data sharing the same label but from different domains by imposing low-rank constraints on the reconstruction coefficient matrix. In this way, the obtained feature representation is transferrable and discriminative. Moreover, LRMPL considers the information preserving during the feature representation learning by integrating a modified PCA-like item into the objective function. To learn a suitable classifier parameter and feature representation, LRMPL also unifies the classifier and feature learning into a single optimization objective. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show LRMPL outperforms the existing traditional transfer learning methods in cross-domain classification. The demo code is available in https://github.com/892384750/ LRMPL.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, the exponential growth of internet technologies has made personal authentication an integral part of security applications. The fingerprint-based biometric systems are essentially used to safeguard the users' privacy and confidentiality. However, such systems are prone to spoof attacks by artificial replicas of the fingerprints. This paper presents an improved feature extractor called BiRi-PAD (Encoded Histogram of Ridge Bifurcations and Contours for fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection) that aims to enhance the accuracy of live fingerprint detection. The feature extraction process of the proposed BiRiPAD consists of four steps. First, the fingerprint image undergoes a process of extracting 2-channel ridge contour maps (2-RC maps). The first channel of 2-RC maps consists of ridge contours extracted by a set of derivative filters in the spatial domain whereas the second channel of 2-RC maps consists of the ridge contours extracted by the maximum moments based on phase congruency in the frequency domain. Further, minutiae-based feature information i.e., ridge bifurcations are extracted by the minimum moments based on phase congruency covariance. Moreover, a fusion equation is proposed to integrate 2-RC maps and bifurcations into a single feature map. Second, an improved Comprehensive Local Phase Quantization (CLPQ) based on the well-known feature descriptor Rotation Invariant Local Phase Quantization (LPQri) is proposed to extract the phase information of ridges. CLPQ extracts the orientation of the ridges by using the complex parts of the significant frequency components of LPQri and monogenic filters. Third, the proposed BiRi-PAD quantizes the 2-RC maps into pre-determined intervals. Finally, both 2-RC maps and CLPQ features are integrated to generate a feature vector of a single fingerprint image. Performance evaluations of BiRi-PAD are conducted on three publicly available benchmarks from the LivDet competition, namely LivDet 2013, 2011, and 2015. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed BiRi-PAD achieves significant reductions in average rates compared to state-of-the-art techniques of fingerprint liveness detection. Specifically, on LivDet 2013, LivDet 2011, and LivDet 2015, the average rates are reduced to 1.92%, 4.39%, and 4.55%, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address this problem, a multi-objective hybrid evolutionary immune algorithm (HEIA) is proposed, where the fuzzy maximum completion time (makespan) and fuzzy total energy consumption are optimized simultaneously. In the proposed HEIA, a two left-shift heuristic based active decoding method is proposed to optimize the fuzzy makespan. Then, two hybrid evolutionary strategies are used to separately enhance the exploration ability and exploitation ability, where a reference point-based angle selection strategy is incorporated to optimize the search mechanism. For the first evolutionary strategy, a Pareto similar information-based crossover operator is adopted to improve population diversity. For the second evolutionary strategy, a deep local search mechanism and four objective-driven neighborhood structures are developed. Finally, five types of instances are generated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HEIA.

TI FSformer: Fast-Slow Transformer for video action recognition

AB Two-stream networks have achieved good results on action recognition datasets by modeling the interdependence of various motions. However, previous two-stream networks focus on action modeling but ignore concentrating on the difference in importance between different short-term actions, causing the limitation of the model's action modeling capabilities between different short-term actions. Therefore, we propose a Short-term Action Differentiated Attention (SADA) module based on the two-stream structure with different temporal resolution inputs. We embed the SADA module in a novel two-stream transformer architecture called Fast-Slow Transformer (FSformer). The SADA module dramatically pays attention to the difference between the importance of different short-term actions. It can: (i) deploy attention from the video frames to learn the differentiated knowledge of the importance of different short-term action feature information for action recognition, (ii) fuse rich importance difference knowledge and context information through a novel Fast-Slow Attention mechanism. Overall, the SADA module significantly focuses on the difference in importance of short-term actions and improves action recognition performance. We evaluate our method's effectiveness on three challenging denselylabeled action datasets and achieve results over the state-of-the-art.

ID FRAMEWORK; NETWORK
AB We address the problem of multi-modal object tracking in video and explore various options available for fusing the complementary information conveyed by the visible (RGB) and thermal infrared (TIR) modalities, including pixel-level, feature-level and decision-level fusion. Specifically, in contrast to the existing approaches, we propose and develop the paradigm for combining multi-modal information for image fusion at pixel level. At the feature level, two different kinds of fusion strategies are investigated for completeness, i.e., the attention based online fusion strategy and the offline-trained fusion block. At the decision level, a novel fusion strategy is put forward, inspired by the success of the simple averaging configuration which has shown so much promise. The effectiveness of the proposed decision-level fusion strategy owes to a number of innovative contributions, including a dynamic weighting of the RGB and TIR contributions and a linear template update operation. A variant of the proposed decision fusion method produced the winning tracker at the Visual Object Tracking Challenge 2020 (VOT-RGBT2020). A comprehensive comparison of the innovative pixel and feature-level fusion strategies with the proposed decision-level fusion method highlights the advantages fusing multimodal information at the decision score level. Extensive experimental results on five challenging datasets, i.e., GTOT, VOT-RGBT2019, RGBT234, LasHeR and VOT-RGBT2020, demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Fast and robust small target detection is one of the key technologies in the infrared (IR) search and tracking systems. With the development of deep learning, there are many data-driven IR small target segmentation algorithms, but they have not been extensively surveyed; we believe our proposed survey is the first to systematically survey them. Focusing on IR small target segmentation tasks, we summarized 7 characteristics of IR small targets, 3 feature extraction methods, 8 design strategies, 30 segmentation networks, 8 loss functions, and 13 evaluation indexes. Then, the accuracy, robustness, and computational complexities of 18 segmentation networks on 5 public datasets were compared and analyzed. Finally, we have discussed the existing problems and future trends in the field of IR small target detection. The proposed survey is a valuable reference for both beginners adapting to current trends in IR small target detection and researchers already experienced in this field.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

DE Face clustering; Map equation; Graph partitioning
AB Face clustering is a critical task in computer vision due to the increasing number of applications such as augmented reality or photo album management. The primary challenge in this task arises from the imperfections in image feature representations. Given image features extracted from an existing pre-trained representation model, it remains an unresolved problem that how to leverage the inherent characteristics of similarities among unlabelled images to improve the clustering performance. In order to solve face clustering in an unsupervised manner, we develop an effective and robust framework named as Adapt-Infomap. First, we reformulate face clustering as a process of non-overlapping community detection. Specially, Adapt-Infomap achieves face clustering by minimizing the entropy of information flows (also known as the map equation) on an affinity graph of images. Since the affinity graph of images might contain noisy edges, we develop an outlier detection strategy in Adapt-Infomap to adaptively refine the affinity graph. Experiments with ablation studies demonstrate that Adapt-Infomap significantly outperforms existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-arts on three popular large-scale datasets for face clustering, e.g., an absolute improvement of more than 10% and 3% comparing with prior unsupervised and supervised methods respectively in terms of average of Pairwise F-score.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

   representation learning; Semantic knowledge; Distribution alignment
AB Person re-identification plays a significant role in realistic scenarios due to its various applications in public security and video surveillance. Recently, leveraging the supervised or semi-unsupervised learning paradigms, which benefits from the large-scale datasets and strong computing performance, has achieved a competitive performance on a specific target domain. However, when Re-ID models are directly deployed in a new domain without target samples, they always suffer from considerable performance degradation and poor domain generalization. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Multimodal Representation Learning network to elaborate rich semantic knowledge for assisting in representation learning during the pre-training. Importantly, a multimodal representation learning strategy is introduced to translate the features of different modalities into the common space, which can significantly boost generalization capability of Re-ID model. As for the fine-tuning stage, a realistic dataset is adopted to fine-tune the pre-trained model for better distribution alignment with real-world data. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform previous domain generalization or meta-learning methods with a clear margin. Our source code will also be publicly available at https://github.com/JeremyXSC/DMRL.

AB In this paper, we study a geometrical inequality conjecture which states that for any four points on a hemisphere with the unit radius, the largest sum of distances between the points is 4 + 4 root 2, the best configuration is a regular square inscribed to the equator, and for any five points, the largest sum is 5 root 5 + 2 root 5 and the best configuration is the regular pentagon inscribed to the equator. We prove that the conjectured configurations are local optimal, and construct a rectangular neighborhood of the local maximum point in the related feasible set, whose size is explicitly determined, and prove that (1): the objective function is bounded by a quadratic polynomial which takes the local maximum point as the unique critical point in the neighborhood, and (2): the remaining part of the feasible set can be partitioned into a finite union of a large number of very small cubes so that on each small cube, the conjecture can be verified by estimating the objective function with exact numerical computation. We also explain the method for constructing the neighborhoods and upperbound quadratic polynomials in detail and describe the computation process outside the constructed neighborhoods briefly.

AB Motion predictions for limbs can be performed using commonly called Hill-based muscle models. For this type of models, a surface electromyogram (sEMG) of the muscle serves as an input signal for the activation of the muscle model. However, the Hill model needs additional information about the mechanical system state of the muscle (current length, velocity, etc.) for a reliable prediction of the muscle force generation and, hence, the prediction of the joint motion. One feature that contains potential information about the state of the muscle is the position of the center of the innervation zone. This feature can be further extracted from the sEMG. To find the center, a wavelet-based algorithm is proposed that localizes motor unit potentials in the individual channels of a single-column sEMG array and then identifies innervation point candidates. In the final step, these innervation point candidates are clustered in a density-based manner. The center of the largest cluster is the estimated center of the innervation zone. The algorithm has been tested in a simulation. For this purpose, an sEMG simulator was developed and implemented that can compute large motor units (1,000's of muscle fibers) quickly (within seconds on a standard PC).

AB Low-light image enhancement (LIE) has attracted tremendous research interests in recent years. Retinex theory-based deep learning methods, following a decomposition-adjustment pipeline, have achieved promising performance due to their physical interpretability. However, existing Retinex-based deep learning methods are still suboptimal, failing to leverage useful insights from traditional approaches. Meanwhile, the adjustment step is either oversimplified or overcomplicated, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in practice. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep-learning framework for LIE. The framework consists of a decomposition network (DecNet) inspired by algorithm unrolling and adjustment networks considering both global and local brightness. The algorithm unrolling allows the integration of both implicit priors learned from data and explicit priors inherited from traditional methods, facilitating better decomposition. Meanwhile, considering global and local brightness guides the design of effective yet lightweight adjustment networks. Moreover, we introduce a self-supervised fine-tuning strategy that achieves promising performance without manual hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark LIE datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinyil256/RAUNA2023.

AB Spatio-temporal forecasting has several applications in neurology, climate, and transportation. One classic example of such a learning assignment is traffic forecasting. The task is complex because of traffic's non-linearity and dynamic nature with shifting road conditions, complex geographic dependence, and the inherent challenges of long-term forecasting. We propose the Dynamic Temporal Position Observant Graph Neural Network (DTPO-GNN). DTPO-GNN considers positional awareness, spatial and temporal reliance on traffic flow for forecasting future traffic speeds. Specifically, DTPO-GNN employs positional awareness via reference nodes to collect global knowledge of graph structure and diffusion convolution employing random walks to gather local information about the structural properties of traffic networks. A controlled sample encoder-decoder architecture and two-way random walks across the graph are used to capture structural and temporal dependency. Combining three large-scale road network traffic statistics from the actual world, we observe a consistent improvement of 11-13 % above baselines from the most recent research.

AB Short-term production planning in industrial mining complexes involves defining daily, weekly or monthly decisions that aim to achieve production targets established by long-term planning. Operational requirements must be considered when defining fleet allocation and production scheduling decisions. Thus, this paper presents an actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) method to make mining equipment allocation and production scheduling decisions that maximize the profitability of a mining operation. Two RL agents are proposed. The first agent allocates shovels to mining fronts by considering some operational requirements. The second agent defines the processing destination and the number of trucks required for transportation. A simulator of mining complex operations is proposed to forecast the material flow from the mining fronts to the destinations. This simulator provides new states and rewards to the RL agents, so shovel allocation and production scheduling decisions can be improved. Additionally, as the mining complex operates, sensors collect ore quality data, which are used to update the uncertainty associated with the orebody models. The improvement in material supply characterization allows the RL agents to make more informed decisions. A case study applied at a copper mining complex highlights the method's ability to make informed decisions while collecting new data. The results show a 47% improvement in cash flow by adapting the shovel and truck allocation and material destination compared to a base case with predefined fleet assignments.

AB Around a third of the total population of Europe suffers from mental disorders. The use of electroencephalography (EEG) together with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to diagnose mental disorders has recently been shown to be a prominent research area, as exposed by several reviews focused on the field. Nevertheless, previous to the application of ML algorithms, EEG data should be correctly preprocessed and prepared via Feature Engineering (FE). In fact, the choice of FE techniques can make the difference between an unusable ML model and a simple, effective model. In other words, it can be said that FE is crucial, especially when using complex, non-stationary data such as EEG. To this aim, in this paper we present a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) focused on FE from EEG data used to identify mental disorders. Our SMS covers more than 900 papers, making it one of the most comprehensive to date, to the best of our knowledge. We gathered the mental disorder addressed, all the FE techniques used, and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm applied for classification from each paper. Our main contributions are: (i) we offer a starting point for new researchers on these topics, (ii) we extract the most used FE techniques to classify mental disorders, (iii) we show several graphical distributions of all used techniques, and (iv) we provide critical conclusions for detecting mental disorders. To provide a better overview of existing techniques, the FE process is divided into three parts: (i) signal transformation, (ii) feature extraction, and (iii) feature selection. Moreover, we classify and analyze the distribution of existing papers according to the mental disorder they treat, the FE processes used, and the ML techniques applied. As a result, we provide a valuable reference for the scientific community to identify which techniques have been proven and tested and where the gaps are located in the current state of the art.

AB A deep learning system (DLS) developed based on one software project for defect prediction may well be applied to the related code on the same project but is usually difficult to be applied to new or unknown software projects. To address this problem, we propose a Transferable Graph Convolutional Neural Network (TGCNN) that can learn defects from the lightweight semantic graphs of code and transfer the learned knowledge from the source project to the target project. We discuss how the semantic graph is constructed from code; how the TGCNN can learn from the graph; and how the learned knowledge can be transferred to a new or unknown project. We also conduct a controlled experiment to evaluate our method. The result shows that despite some limitations, our method performs considerably better than existing methods.

AB IntroductionMachine learning tasks often require a significant amount of training data for the resultant network to perform suitably for a given problem in any domain. In agriculture, dataset sizes are further limited by phenotypical differences between two plants of the same genotype, often as a result of different growing conditions. Synthetically-augmented datasets have shown promise in improving existing models when real data is not available. MethodsIn this paper, we employ a contrastive unpaired translation (CUT) generative adversarial network (GAN) and simple image processing techniques to translate indoor plant images to appear as field images. While we train our network to translate an image containing only a single plant, we show that our method is easily extendable to produce multiple-plant field images. ResultsFurthermore, we use our synthetic multi-plant images to train several YoloV5 nano object detection models to perform the task of plant detection and measure the accuracy of the model on real field data images. DiscussionThe inclusion of training data generated by the CUT-GAN leads to better plant detection performance compared to a network trained solely on real data.

AB This paper proposes a self-learning Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (SL-MCTS), which has the ability to continuously improve its problem-solving ability in single-player scenarios. SL-MCTS combines the MCTS algorithm with a two-branch neural network (PV-Network). The MCTS architecture can balance the search for exploration and exploitation. PV-Network replaces the rollout process of MCTS and predicts the promising search direction and the value of nodes, which increases the MCTS convergence speed and search efficiency. The paper proposes an effective method to assess the trajectory of the current model during the self-learning process by comparing the performance of the current model with that of its best-performing historical model. Additionally, this method can encourage SL-MCTS to generate optimal solutions during the self-learning process. We evaluate the performance of SL-MCTS on the robot path planning scenario. The experimental results show that the performance of SL-MCTS is far superior to the traditional MCTS and single-player MCTS algorithms in terms of path quality and time consumption, especially its time consumption is half less than that of the traditional MCTS algorithms. SL-MCTS also performs comparably to other iterative-based search algorithms designed specifically for path planning tasks.

AB This paper presents an equestrian motion phase segmentation framework with wearable body sensor network (BSN). In our method, the wearable inertial sensor nodes were arranged on the riders' body segments and horseback. An extend Kalman filter is proposed for multi-sensor data fusion whose accuracy is validated by optical motion capture system, and the 3-D posture of rider in equestrian is reconstructed by constructing a three-dimensional human kinematics model. In addition, a deep network TCN-Bi-LSTM is proposed for equestrian phase segmentation under different equestrian gaits, and five baseline classifiers are chosen for comparison to validate the robustness of TCN-Bi-LSTM. Furthermore, the impact of different sensor numbers on the accuracy of phase segmentation is also studied to determine the optimal sensor numbers. Detection performance is evaluated using metrics of accuracy, specificity, recall, and F1 score, and the performance indicators after final convergence remain stable at 98.7%, 98.8%, 98.7% and 98.7% for walking, 97.8%, 97.8%, 97.9% and 97.8% for rising trot, 97.6%, 97.4%, 97.5%, 97.4% for sitting trot, 97.9%, 97.9%, 97.9% and 97.9% for canter, respectively. We believe that by exploring the application of BSN in this curious field of equestrian competition, it is very meaningful to expand the application field of BSN.

AB To construct a strong classifier ensemble, base classifiers should be accurate and diverse. However, there is no uniform standard for the definition and measurement of diversity. This work proposes a learners' interpretability diversity (LID) to measure the diversity of interpretable machine learners. It then proposes a LID-based classifier ensemble. Such an ensemble concept is novel because: 1) interpretability is used as an important basis for diversity measurement and 2) before its training, the difference between two interpretable base learners can be measured. To verify the proposed method's effectiveness, we choose a decision-tree-initialized dendritic neuron model (DDNM) as a base learner for ensemble design. We apply it to seven benchmark datasets. The results show that the DDNM ensemble combined with LID obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency compared to some popular classifier ensembles. A random-forest-initialized dendritic neuron model (RDNM) combined with LID is an outstanding representative of the DDNM ensemble.

TI Learn to Adapt for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Depth estimation; meta-learning; transferability
AB Monocular depth estimation is one of the fundamental tasks in environmental perception and has achieved tremendous progress by virtue of deep learning. However, the performance of trained models tends to degrade or deteriorate when employed on other new datasets due to the gap between different datasets. Though some methods utilize domain adaptation technologies to jointly train different domains and narrow the gap between them, the trained models cannot generalize to new domains that are not involved in training. To boost the transferability of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models and mitigate the issue of meta-overfitting, we train the model in the pipeline of meta-learning and propose an adversarial depth estimation task. We adopt model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to obtain universal initial parameters for further adaptation and train the network in an adversarial manner to extract domain-invariant representations for easing meta-overfitting. In addition, we propose a constraint to impose upon cross-task depth consistency to compel the depth estimation to be identical in different adversarial tasks, which improves the performance of our method and smoothens the training process. Experiments on four new datasets demonstrate that our method adapts quite fast to new domains. Our method trained after 0.5 epoch achieves comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods trained at least 20 epochs.

AB Weighted voting games are a well-studied class of succinct simple games that can be used to model collective decision-making in, e.g., legislative bodies such as parliaments and shareholder voting. Power indices [1-4] are used to measure the influence of players in weighted voting games. In such games, it has been studied how a distinguished player's power can be changed, e.g., by merging or splitting players (the latter is a.k.a. false-name manipulation) [5, 6], by changing the quota [7], or via structural control by adding or deleting players [8]. We continue the work on the structural control initiated by Rey and Rothe [8] by solving some of their open problems. In addition, we also modify their model to a more realistic setting in which the quota is indirectly changed during the addition or deletion of players (in a different sense than that of Zuckerman et al. [7] who manipulate the quota directly without changing the set of players), and we study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational complexity.

ID SPIKING; RECOGNITION
AB Word representations, usually derived from a large corpus and endowed with rich semantic information, have been widely applied to natural language tasks. Traditional deep language models, on the basis of dense word representations, requires large memory space and computing resource. The brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems, with the advantages of better biological interpretability and less energy consumption, still have major difficulties in the representation of words in terms of neuronal activities, which has restricted their further application in more complicated downstream language tasks. Comprehensively exploring the diverse neuronal dynamics of both integration and resonance, we probe into three spiking neuron models to post-process the original dense word embeddings, and test the generated sparse temporal codes on several tasks concerning both word-level and sentence-level semantics. The experimental results show that our sparse binary word representations could perform on par with or even better than original word embeddings in capturing semantic information, while requiring less storage. Our methods provide a robust representation foundation of language in terms of neuronal activities, which could potentially be applied to future downstream natural language tasks under neuromorphic computing systems.

AB In this study, we developed a novel multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework for evaluating and benchmarking hybrid multi-deep transfer learning models using radiography X-ray coronavirus disease (COVID-19) images. First, we collected and pre-processed eight public databases related to the targeted datasets. Second, convolutional neural network (CNN) models extracted features from 1,338 chest X-ray (CXR) frontal view image data using six pre-trained models: VGG16, VGG19, painters, SqueezeNet, DeepLoc, and Inception v3. Then, we used the intersection between the six CNN models and eight classical machine learning (ML) methods, including AdaBoost, Decision Tree, logistic regression, random forest, kNN, neural network, and Naive Bayes, to introduce 48 hybrid classification models. In this study, eight supervised ML methods were used to classify COVID-19 CXR images. The classifiers were implemented using the TensorFlow2 and Keras libraries in Python. A feature vector was extracted from each image, and a five-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the performance. The cost parameter c was set to 1 and the gamma parameter ? was set to 0.1 for all classifiers. The experiments were run on a Windows-based computer with dual Intel I CoITM i7 processors at 2.50GHz, 8GB of RAM, and a graphical processing unit of 2GB. The performance metrics of the 48 hybrid models, including the classification accuracy (CA), specificity, area under the curve (AUC), F1 score, precision, recall, and log loss, were used as efficient evaluation criteria. Third, the MCDM approach was used, which included (i) developing a dynamic decision matrix based on seven evaluation metrics and the developed hybrid models, (ii) developing the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency method for determining the weight coefficients for the seven-evaluation metrics with zero inconsistency, and (iii) developing the Visekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method for benchmarking the 48 hybrid models. Our experimental results reveal that (i) CA and AUC obtained the highest importance weights of 0.164 and 0.147, respectively, whereas F1 and specificity obtained the lowest weights of 0.134 and 0.134, respectively, and (ii) the highest three hybrid model scores were painters neural network, painters logistic regression, and VGG16-logistic regression, making them the highest ranking scores. Finally, the developed framework was validated using sensitivity analysis and comparison analysis.

First, a wavelet basis ANN algorithm is proposed to determine the discretization strategy in continuous space. The hidden layer node transfer function in a BP neural network is replaced by a wavelet basis function, and the modified BP neural network is composed of a wavelet neural network. Second, an improved wolf algorithm is established. The core wolf system ensures the precision of the whole exploration task. Finally, main and auxiliary double cores and a five-class decision factor are used to establish a population classification model to solve the convergence of the algorithm.

AB Many different histogram equalization (HE)-based image enhancement methods have been developed to overcome the problems of low or high image brightness, contrast sensitivity, and difficulty in revealing details of dark areas under low-light environments. In this paper, a novel image enhancement method based on HE and adaptive gamma correction with weight distribution (AGCWD) is proposed for natural and effective image enhancement. In this method, histogram stretching is performed on Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color components of image, and then the color space of RGB image is converted to Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space. The histograms of S and I components are divided into sub-histograms according to the exposure threshold. The underexposure regions are enhanced with a new AGCWD. Then, the color space of HSI image is converted to RGB color space. Finally, the HE is applied to the input image with the obtained image histogram map. Thus, the method has not only effectively prevented the over-enhancement of the contrast but also obtained the quality and natural enhanced image. The proposed method is compared with the most known contrast enhancement methods and low-light enhancement methods. Experimental results have supported that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of both visual perception and objective evaluation.

DE Cross-modal retrieval; cross-attention; intra-modal and inter-modal
   relations; video moment retrieval
AB The video moment retrieval task aims to fetch a target moment in an untrimmed video, which best matches the semantics of a sentence query. Existing methods mainly focus on utilizing two separate modules: one learns intra-modal relations to understand video and query contents, and the other explores inter-modal interactions to build a semantic bridge between video and language. However, intra-modal relations information can be easily overlooked when capturing inter-modal interactions. In fact, intra-modal relations and inter-modal interactions can be learned simultaneously within a unified module to make video and sentence guide each other. Towards this end, we propose a Cross-Modal Interaction Network (CMIN) for video moment retrieval by jointly exploring the intra-modal relations and inter-modal interactions between video frames and query words. In CMIN, a query-guided channel attention module is designed to suppress query-irrelevant visual features and enhance crucial contents; then a cross-attention module simultaneously considers intra-modal relations within each modality and fine-grained inter-modal interactions between frames and words, to enhance the semantic relevance between video and sentence query. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the experiments on two public datasets (Charades-STA and TACoS) demonstrate the superiority of our method.

AB This article studies the stability problem of discrete-time switched positive linear systems (SPLSs) with marginally stable subsystems. Based on the weak common linear copositive Lyapunov function (weak CLCLF) approach, the switching property and the state component property are combined to ensure the asymptotic stability of SPLSs under three types of switching signals. First, considering the transfer-restricted switching signal described by the switching digraph, novel cycle-dependent joint path conditions are proposed in combination with state component digraphs. Second, under the time interval sequence, two types of path conditions are constructed for designing switching schemes. Third, necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of SPLSs under arbitrary switching are established. Finally, three examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB In this article, we bring forward a completely perturbed nonconvex Schatten p-minimization to address a model of completely perturbed low-rank matrix recovery (LRMR). This article based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) and the Schatten-p null space property (NSP) generalizes the investigation to a complete perturbation model thinking over not only noise but also perturbation, and it gives the RIP condition and the Schatten-p NSP assumption that guarantee the recovery of low-rank matrix and the corresponding reconstruction error bounds. In particular, the analysis of the result reveals that in the case that p decreases 0 and a > 1 for the complete perturbation and low-rank matrix, the condition is the optimal sufficient condition d(2r )< 1 (Recht et al., 2010). In addition, we study the connection between RIP and Schatten-p NSP and discern that Schatten-p NSP can be inferred from the RIP. The numerical experiments are conducted to show better performance and provide outperformance of the nonconvex Schatten p-minimization method comparing with the convex nuclear norm minimization approach in the completely perturbed scenario.

   (ReID)
AB Supervised person re-identification (ReID) has attracted widespread attentions in the computer vision community due to its great potential in real-world applications. However, the demand of human annotation heavily limits the application as it is costly to annotate identical pedestrians appearing from different cameras. Thus, how to reduce the annotation cost while preserving the performance remains challenging and has been studied extensively. In this article, we propose a tracklet-aware co-cooperative annotators' framework to reduce the demand of human annotation. Specifically, we partition the training samples into different clusters and associate adjacent images in each cluster to produce the robust tracklet which decreases the annotation requirements significantly. Besides, to further reduce the cost, we introduce a powerful teacher model in our framework to implement the active learning strategy and select the most informative tracklets for human annotator, the teacher model itself, in our setting, also acts as an annotator to label the relatively certain tracklets. Thus, our final model could be well-trained with both confident pseudo-labels and human-given annotations. Extensive experiments on three popular person ReID datasets demonstrate that our approach could achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in both active learning and unsupervised learning (USL) settings.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Generative adversarial autoencoders; generative replay mechanism (GRM);
   lifelong learning
AB Lifelong learning describes an ability that enables humans to continually acquire and learn new information without forgetting. This capability, common to humans and animals, has lately been identified as an essential function for an artificial intelligence system aiming to learn continuously from a stream of data during a certain period of time. However, modern neural networks suffer from degenerated performance when learning multiple domains sequentially and fail to recognize past learned tasks after being retrained. This corresponds to catastrophic forgetting and is ultimately induced by replacing the parameters associated with previously learned tasks with new values. One approach in lifelong learning is the generative replay mechanism (GRM) that trains a powerful generator as the generative replay network, implemented by a variational autoencoder (VAE) or a generative adversarial network (GAN). In this article, we study the forgetting behavior of GRM-based learning systems by developing a new theoretical framework in which the forgetting process is expressed as an increase in the model's risk during the training. Although many recent attempts have provided high-quality generative replay samples by using GANs, they are limited to mainly downstream tasks due to the lack of inference. Inspired by the theoretical analysis while aiming to address the drawbacks of existing approaches, we propose the lifelong generative adversarial autoencoder (LGAA). LGAA consists of a generative replay network and three inference models, each addressing the inference of a different type of latent variable. The experimental results show that LGAA learns novel visual concepts without forgetting and can be applied to a wide range of downstream tasks.

AB The selection of medical waste treatment techniques has become a serious health and safety issue since the amount and variety of medical waste are rapidly increasing during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the whole world. This paper aims to propose an integrated interval type-2 fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations-II (PROMETHEE-II) decision model for medical waste treatment techniques selection problem considering interactive relationships among criteria under a high uncertain environment. First, interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs) are introduced to express imprecision information within the context of high uncertainty. Second, a type-2 Prioritized Aggregation (PA) operator is constructed to aggregate the evaluation information considering the priority of experts. Third, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method is combined with the IT2FS to calculate the weights of criteria considering the interaction relationships among them. Then, an extended interval type-2 fuzzy PROMETHEE-II method is proposed to rank each alternative, in which a distance measure-based preference function is adopted. After that, a case study of medical waste treatment selection in Jiangsu province is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that incineration is the most appropriate approach in handling medical waste. Finally, sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis are implemented to further test the advantages of the proposed approach.

AB With the development of formal concept analysis, classical concept lattice cannot solve some problems in practice because of its strict conditions. Protoconcept, which is an extension of the formal concept, provides a new method of data processing. Three-way decisions is more in line with human cognition. Not like the decision of two ways, three-way cognition expands its scope of application. However, up to now, protoconcept is influenced by two-way decisions which leads to the restrictions of its applications. Hence, it is urgent to find a method to generalize protoconcept from the framework of two-way decisions. To give the solution to this urgent problem, the main contributions of this paper are the following: First, using the combination of protoconcept and three-way decisions, two models of three-way protoconcept are obtained. The algorithms for searching three-way protoconcept are built. Second, we investigate the constructions of three-way protoconcepts in double Boolean algebra. Third, the relationships between protoconcepts and three-way protoconcepts are found. Moreover, using examples that come from the real world, we explain the main results obtained above and show some applications. The two models for protoconcepts provided in this paper generalize the fields of thought from two-way decisions to three-way decisions. This follows that they are more in line with human thinking. Hence, the two models will certainly generalize the applications of protoconcept theory in the future.

AB Retinal diseases are most widely affected by various types of people without any proper reason. Nowadays, many retinal diseases are identified by experts. Detecting retinal diseases in the early stages is very important with better accuracy. Deep learning (DL) techniques are commonly used in the early prediction of retinal disorders. In DL, multiple layers accurately detect abnormalities in the retinal images. Various datasets are also present for this research work. This paper uses a hybrid multilayered classification (HMLC/CNN-VGG19). This system is developed to categorize four kinds of retinal disorders (age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, Drusen, diabetic retinopathy, as well as typical cases). The proposed H.M.L.C. is applied to OCT to gather pictures from different data sources, like the U.C.I. repository, Kaggle, etc. The CNN and VGG-19 models used in the H.M.L.C. are implemented in Python over the datasets. The experimental results in terms of classification accuracy are verified. The classification accuracy is high since the H.M.L.C. used the advanced features from CNN and VGG-19 models. The performance is calculated using sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and accuracy.

AB The proposed work integrates a smart embedded health monitoring system with IoT. The data that are sensed and analyzed from the system are secured using blockchain technology and are transmitted and further analyzed. Blockchains are used in various sectors. Mainly they are welcomed for their secure transactions and the privacy that we can ensure through it. In this paper, our proposed system explored its uses in the healthcare sector. The health sector is where information is of privacy concern for patients and needed information for doctors treating them. Blockchain is the best-suited solution for Identity and Access Management (IAM) needed in the healthcare sector. As blockchains have different types named public and private blockchains, we recommend private blockchains be implemented where no anyone can make transactions and mine the transactions. Patients, doctors, and hospital organizations care for their privacy, and authorized access to others' data, is the reason for the choice of the private blockchain. Adding to the IAM, blockchain also accounts for flexibility, decentralization, and an immutable ledger. Those operations are authenticated and authorized by a blockchain admin who has no relationship with the entities that exist in the network. The owner of the data is given the sole control of permitting access to their data. Our system asks patients for permission to be given to any doctor who is requesting access to those data. Also, patients can permit a doctor they want within the network. Hyperledger uses no online currencies and hence no miners to wait for. This is important as it reduces the waiting time for a transaction to be verified. REST API is used for collecting information requested from the blockchain and presenting it to the end-users. The proposed system is very unique to the date in which a dedicated smart embedded system is developed to monitor the vital parameters of the patient; once the abnormality is sensed, it will be spontaneously alerted and the connected recording system is activated after the sensors read the deviations very accurately and are unique than conventional methods. Our system provides a secure, reliable, and IAM-included network in a webpage that can be accessed across all devices.

AB There are various kinds of fuzzy inner products. It was shown (Byun et al. in Mathematics 8:571, 2020) that a fuzzy inner product on a vector space, producing a fuzzy real number as its value, is merely the embedding of a real-valued inner product into the fuzzy number systems over the set of tuples consisting of elements in the space because of its linear property. Thus, the linear property is needed to be weakened. In this paper, a new concept, called a fuzzy real weak inner product on a vector space, is introduced and some nontrivial examples are given. Then, a fuzzy real weak inner product in a suitable condition is deeply studied, which may be either almost positive-definite or positive-definite. Furthermore, it satisfies both Cauchy inequality and Parallelogram law even though it is not linear. And some properties of a general type of a fuzzy real weak inner product, especially the approximation related to the Parallelogram law, are investigated in analytic viewpoint.

AB Accurately estimated highway traffic flow info plays a decisive role in dynamic and real-time road management, planning, and preventing frequent/recurring traffic jams, traffic rule violations, and chain/fatal traffic accidents. Traffic flow information is extracted by processing raw camera images via vehicle detection and tracking algorithms. Object detectors including the Yolo, single-shot detector, and EfficientNet algorithms are used for vehicle detection; however, You only look once version 5 (Yolov5) has a clear advantage in terms of real-time performance. Due to this reason, the pre-trained Yolov5 models were utilized in the vehicle detection part, and in the vehicle tracking module, a novel tracker algorithm was developed using vehicle detection features. The performance of the proposed approach was measured by comparing it to the Kalman filter-based tracker. The evaluation results show that the proposed tracking approach outperformed the Kalman filter-based tracker with 5.82% (Buses), 2.24% (Cars), 36.50% (Trucks), and overall 2.58% better traffic counting accuracy for the 12 nighttime case study videos captured from the highways with different horizontal and vertical angle-of-views.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; DESIGN
AB Meta-heuristics have been successfully applied to many complex optimization problems. One of the main reasons for its success is its ability to handle non-convex, nonlinear, multimodal, multi-variable, and multi-objective problems with easy implementation. However, the quality of the response of these algorithms to an optimization problem is highly susceptible to the control parameters, and few works aim to tune them or find tools that can improve the algorithms. The literature is rich in proposals for new algorithms, but not for improving existing ones. This paper presents different strategies for tuning and accelerating meta-heuristics using the first hybrid algorithm in the literature. The Lichtenberg algorithm is inspired by lightning and Lichtenberg figures and has been increasingly successfully applied to various optimization problems. However, a study of its best parameters has never been presented until now. After a discussion of the best tuning tools, its tuning parameters are performed using response surface methodology. Then, 14 versions are studied through 10 test functions using chaos theory and Levy flights scenarios. After 13,500 simulations, the chaotic Lichtenberg algorithm equipped with the piecewise function and tuned parameters proved the best version with only 16% similarity to the original algorithm. Then, it was compared to the genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, gray wolf optimizer, salp swarm optimization, whale optimization algorithm, and dragonfly algorithm. The proposed algorithm had both the best average accuracy, lower computational cost, and the smallest standard deviation.

AB By increasing world food demand, the agricultural food supply chain has become a key element in the global business competitive environment. Also, the growing population causes increased demand for edible vegetable oils. Edible oil is one of the main products in the home food basket, which shows the importance and attention to the supply chain network of edible vegetable oils. As a result, the present research aims to design a sustainable supply chain network of edible vegetable oils under uncertainty. A mixed-integer linear programming model has developed with three objective functions, including minimizing costs, minimizing environmental impacts, and maximizing social impact. The multi-objective mathematical model has been solved by the preemptive fuzzy goal programming method. In this study, the demand for final edible oil and meals is considered uncertain. A case study has been considered in the supply chain network design of Iranian edible vegetable oils to validate the proposed model. In order to collect the dataset of the input parameters, we considered the three aspects of big data, namely variety, velocity, and volume. Furthermore, some sensitivity analyses have been provided for the main parameters of the present research. The obtained results show that the most important component of the cost objective function is production costs. Furthermore, import tariff and its value have a significant impact on the objective functions and decision variables, including area under cultivation, water consumption, and number of workers. Finally, some suggestions are presented for managers and experts in this industry.

AB Bat Algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic that is used to find solutions to NP-Hard problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A Parallel Bat Colony Optimization Algorithm (PBCOA) based on the introduction of colonies to the popular Bat Algorithm is proposed in this article. The concept of colonies is introduced in the Bat Algorithm along with phenomena like reproductive crossover and migration. The resultant Parallel Bat Colony Optimization Algorithm is tested on 30 standard benchmark Functions, on which it shows clear superiority over 17 other optimization algorithms. PBCOA is applied to evolve CNN architectures over landmark recognition datasets. The learning rate and layers in the network were artificially selected as 0.9 and 3 respectively to quicken the process of training and make the model lesser complex. Even under the specified time and memory constraints, PBCOA improves the network accuracy and F1 Score from around 0.80 and less to more than 0.99. The evolved network, when tested on larger datasets, also shows an unprecedented improvement in performance, thereby meaning that the evolution of CNNs with PBCOA can be highly desirable.

AB Artificial intelligence technology, with its high efficiency, precision, automation and other characteristics, has become a new idea and a new method to solve the problem of public health security. A monitoring and early warning method of public health security based on artificial intelligence system is proposed. Based on the application status and development trend of artificial intelligence technology in the field of public health security, this method is proposed. The system needs feature extraction and selection of data to extract the features related to public health events. Technology such as machine learning and deep learning can be used for feature extraction and selection to obtain the most predictive features. By using advanced algorithms and models, the method can analyze various types of data to identify potential public health risks and provide early warnings to relevant authorities and the public. This method can help authorities and the public to detect and respond to public health emergencies in a timely and effective manner, thereby preventing the spread of diseases and reducing the impact of public health threats on people's lives and health.

AB Virtual reality is the use of computer simulation technology to generate a three-dimensional virtual world, which can provide users with visual, auditory, and tactile simulations as in the real world. Users can interact with things in this space, move with their own will, and have a sense of integration and participation. The virtual reality is a virtual reality technology based on panoramic images. A panoramic image is a panoramic image formed by splicing one or several groups of images at a 360-degree angle and realizes three-dimensional interaction through computer technology. A wireless network refers to any type of radio computer network, commonly combined with a telecommunication network, that links nodes to each other without cables. However, the current interior design platform can only carry out the layout from the perspective of space. Based on the existing research results, this paper combines the positioning of the indoor space with the realistic stereoscopic images and uses the three-dimensional virtual vision to design the indoor space. On this basis, an indoor space localization method based on indoor environment is proposed and studied in detail. And the positioning algorithm in the indoor environment is optimized and perfected, and the simulation and simulation are carried out on this basis. Finally, combined with the specific realization of the indoor environment, the test results are analyzed. The experimental results show that, taking the average score of 5 questionnaires as a sample, the method of this research has a score of 95 in practice. Compared with the conventional method, its score is far more than 80 points, and the ease of use is also more than 90 points. It shows that the method proposed in this paper is superior to the traditional design method, has high practicability and artistry, and obtains high user satisfaction.

ID SYSTEMS
AB Recommender systems have become increasingly important in today's digital age, but they are not without their challenges. One of the most significant challenges is that users are not always willing to share their preferences due to privacy concerns, yet they still require decent recommendations. Privacy-preserving collaborative recommenders remedy such concerns by letting users set their privacy preferences before submitting to the recommendation provider. Another recently discussed challenge is the problem of popularity bias, where the system tends to recommend popular items more often than less popular ones, limiting the diversity of recommendations and preventing users from discovering new and interesting items. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the randomized perturbation-based data disguising procedure of privacy-preserving collaborative recommender algorithms against the popularity bias problem. For this purpose, we construct user personas of varying privacy protection levels and scrutinize the performance of ten recommendation algorithms on these user personas regarding the accuracy and beyond-accuracy perspectives. We also investigate how well-known popularity-debiasing strategies combat the issue in privacy-preserving environments. In experiments, we employ three well-known real-world datasets. The key findings of our analysis reveal that privacy-sensitive users receive unbiased and fairer recommendations that are qualified in diversity, novelty, and catalogue coverage perspectives in exchange for tolerable sacrifice from accuracy. Also, prominent popularity-debiasing strategies fall considerably short as provided privacy level improves.

AB Access to legal information is fundamental to access to justice. Yet accessibility refers not only to making legal documents available to the public, but also rendering legal information comprehensible to them. A vexing problem in bringing legal information to the public is how to turn formal legal documents such as legislation and judgments, which are often highly technical, to easily navigable and comprehensible knowledge to those without legal education. In this study, we formulate a three-step approach for bringing legal knowledge to laypersons, tackling the issues of navigability and comprehensibility. First, we translate selected sections of the law into snippets (called CLIC-pages), each being a small piece of article that focuses on explaining certain technical legal concept in layperson's terms. Second, we construct a Legal Question Bank, which is a collection of legal questions whose answers can be found in the CLIC-pages. Third, we design an interactive CLIC Recommender. Given a user's verbal description of a legal situation that requires a legal solution, CRec interprets the user's input and shortlists questions from the question bank that are most likely relevant to the given legal situation and recommends their corresponding CLIC pages where relevant legal knowledge can be found. In this paper we focus on the technical aspects of creating an LQB. We show how large-scale pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, can be used to generate legal questions. We compare machine-generated questions against human-composed questions and find that MGQs are more scalable, cost-effective, and more diversified, while HCQs are more precise. We also show a prototype of CRec and illustrate through an example how our 3-step approach effectively brings relevant legal knowledge to the public.

AB This paper focuses on inverse reinforcement learning for autonomous navigation using distance and semantic category observations. The objective is to infer a cost function that explains demonstrated behavior while relying only on the expert's observations and state-control trajectory. We develop a map encoder, that infers semantic category probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as a deep neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly observable, the model parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. We propose a new model of expert behavior that enables error minimization using a closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. Our approach allows generalizing the learned behavior to new environments with new spatial configurations of the semantic categories. We analyze the different components of our model in a minigrid environment. We also demonstrate that our approach learns to follow traffic rules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying on semantic observations of buildings, sidewalks, and road lanes.

DE Information extraction; Natural language processing; Graph propagation;
   Cognitive computation
AB Information extraction (IE) transforms unstructured textual sources into structured knowledge, closely resembling human reasoning. IE involves several subtasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), relation extraction (RE), and coreference resolution (CR). The early IE models tend to treat each subtask as a separate task or to apply a sequential pipeline approach, which can lead to cascading errors and obfuscation of the inherent relationship between tasks. Recent research has shown that it is advantageous to incorporate the interdependence of subtasks and optimize performance through joint learning. However, they do not properly model the interaction between tasks, either by modeling the subtasks sequentially or by using shared input data. Inspired by human reasoning, a graph-based multitask IE framework is presented that facilitates the interaction between several IE tasks capable of capturing both local and global information. Graphs were constructed by selecting the most confident entity spans and coupling them with a confidence-weighted relation type and a confidence-weighted coreference. Additionally, in the study, a dynamic span graph approach was employed, where span updates were propagated across both the coreference and the relation graph. This allowed useful information to be learned from a broader context by enhancing interaction across different IE tasks. The input data were globally shared, and the interaction between subtasks was fully exploited, avoiding cascading errors. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multitask IE framework outperforms the state-of-the-art in multiple information extraction tasks spanning a variety of datasets. The relative error reductions range from 0.19 to 3.74%. This paper presents the feasibility of a cognitively-inspired unified graph-based information extraction framework, which is shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple IE tasks across various domains. The framework's ability to enhance interaction across tasks allows it to learn valuable information from a broader context.

Once a meal has started cooking on the stove, the cook prepares the next meal on the table where the preparation time is dependent on the previous meal prepared. For the solution of this problem, besides several simple construction algorithms and a new version of the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, we focus on enhanced versions of the recently introduced migrating birds optimization (MBO) algorithm. The original MBO algorithm might suffer from early convergence. Here we introduce several different ways of handling this problem. The extensive numerical experimentation conducted shows the superiority of the enhanced MBO over the original MBO (about 2.62 per cent) and over the SA algorithm (about 1.05 per cent).

AB Fuzzy similarity measures are utilized to match two or more records and are essential to deal with data classification and pattern-matching problems. We have noticed that the existing studies on similarity measures in the classical fuzzy framework have certain issues, for example, inappropriate identification of structured linguistic variables, inappropriate classification results, etc. In this paper, we propose three new fuzzy similarity measures based on continuous functions and realize their advantages in connection with their application to pattern recognition and cluster analysis. The validity of clusters is also identified using the concept of cluster validity index. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed similarity measures show higher accuracy in the identification of structured linguistic variables and a higher degree of confidence in the classification of unknown patterns. Several application examples with artificial and real data are utilized to demonstrate the credibility and advantages of the proposed similarity measures.

AB Automatic brain tumour segmentation in MRI scans aims to separate the brain tumour's endoscopic core, edema, non-enhancing tumour core, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumour core from three-dimensional MR voxels. Due to the wide range of brain tumour intensity, shape, location, and size, it is challenging to segment these regions automatically. UNet is the prime three-dimensional CNN network performance source for medical imaging applications like brain tumour segmentation. This research proposes a context aware 3D ARDUNet (Attentional Residual Dropout UNet) network, a modified version of UNet to take advantage of the ResNet and soft attention. A novel residual dropout block (RDB) is implemented in the analytical encoder path to replace traditional UNet convolutional blocks to extract more contextual information. A unique Attentional Residual Dropout Block (ARDB) in the decoder path utilizes skip connections and attention gates to retrieve local and global contextual information. The attention gate enabled the Network to focus on the relevant part of the input image and suppress irrelevant details.

DE Ontology matching; Similarity measures; Deep reinforcement learning;
   Binary classification
AB The ontology matching is an active field of research, which is considered as a key solution to solve the semantic heterogeneity problem. Given two ontologies, the alignment process produces a set of matches each linking two entities. To address this issue, we have reformulated the alignment problem as a binary classification problem using different similarity measures between different ontologies entities as features. In our approach, we propose a model based on deep reinforcement learning, using deep Q-learning network. In this model, the classification action is carried out by the agent at each time step, and the environment evaluates the agent's decisions and returns a reward to this latter. In order to improve the performance of our model, we have made a comparative study with state-of-the-art approaches tackling the ontology matching problem. The approach is evaluated on two datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative campaign (OAEI). Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed models outperform some machine learning-based approaches and are comparable in performance to other existing systems that use different techniques.

AB With the transformer-based pre-trained language models, multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) systems can reach a particular level of performance. This study focuses on inheriting the benefits of contextualized language representations acquired by language models and transferring and sharing information among MCQA datasets. In this work, a method called multi-stage-fine-tuning considering the Curriculum Learning strategy is presented, which proposes sequencing not training samples, but the source datasets in a meaningful order, not randomized. Consequently, an extensive series of experiments over various MCQA datasets shows that the proposed method reaches remarkable performance enhancements than classical fine-tuning over picked baselines T5 and RoBERTa. Moreover, the experiments are conducted on merged source datasets, and the proposed method achieves improved performance. This study shows that increasing the number of source datasets and even using some small-scale datasets helps build well-generalized models. Moreover, having a higher similarity between source datasets and target also plays a vital role in the performance.

AB Although there has been considerable progress in molecular property prediction in computer-aided drug design, there is a critical need to have fast and accurate models. Many of the currently available methods are mostly specialize in predicting specific properties, leading to the use of many models side-by-side that lead to impossibly high computational overheads for the common researcher. Henceforth, the authors propose a single, generalist unified model exploiting graph convolutional variational encoders that can simultaneously predict multiple properties such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity, target-specific docking score prediction, and drug-drug interactions. The use of such a method allows for state-of-the-art virtual screening with a considerable acceleration advantage of up to two orders of magnitude. The minimization of a graph variational encoder's latent space also allows for accelerated development of specific drugs for targets with Pareto optimality principles considered, and has the added advantage of explainability.
   Computer-aided drug design has a high computational cost and a newly identified drug candidate might be unsuitable due to a range of drug properties. Lam and colleagues trained a model based on graph convolutional variational encoders that predicts a range of properties simultaneously to accelerate virtual screening.

DT Article
DE Air combat; Multi-agent system; Communication; Graph attention
AB Air-to-air combat system is a complex multi-agent system (MAS) wherein a large number of unmanned combat aerial vehicles learn to combat with their opponents in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment. Because of the local observability of each individual, it is difficult for classical multi-agent learning methods to get effective cooperative strategies. Recently, a communication mechanism has been proposed to solve the local observability issue of MAS. However, existing methods with predefined rules easily cause an exponential increase in state-action pairs, leading to high communication costs. Taking this cue, this paper designs a graph neural network based on a two-stage graph-attention mechanism to capture the key interaction relationships and communication connections between agents in complex air-to-air combat scenarios. Based on an essential backbone multi-agent reinforcement learning method, known as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization, the proposed method with a hard- and soft-attention scheme can realize the dynamic adjustment of the communication relationship and ad hoc network of multiple agents, by cutting off the unrelated interaction connections while building the correlation importance between pair agents, concurrently. Last but not least, the experimental study in the simulation environment has validated the significance of our proposed method in solving the large-scale air-to-air combat problems.

AB For the characteristics of the dynamic response real test data of underwater explosive vessels with few feature dimensions, unclear feature relationships and small effective data amount, to improve the prediction precision of the dynamic response of the container, a dynamic response prediction model based on the LOO-XGBoost algorithm is proposed. The model uses a CART tree as the base learner, inputs the preprocessed data, and trains the target model layer by building multiple weak learners. Compared with the prediction models based on LOO-SVR, 10FLOD-XGBoost and BPNN, the simulation performance is better, the prediction accuracy is higher, and it has the significant advantage of avoiding the standardization of data features and not caring about whether the features are inter-dependent. It provides certain feasibility for the statistical prediction of the small sample capacity of similar projects.

   Support vectors; GLCM; LBP
AB Gender identification and classification from handwritten images are a challenging problem that has attracted considerable attention recently. Automatically determining a person's gender from their handwriting is the mission. In this research, we employ support vector machine (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA) to develop a novel approach to gender categorization based on handwritten picture data. The proposed method begins by applying PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. This step is important because handwritten images can be high-dimensional, which can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. After reducing the dimensionality, the PCA-transformed data are fed into an SVM classifier for gender identification and classification. We evaluate the performance of our method on a publicly available dataset of handwritten images, and our experimental results show that our method achieves high accuracy in gender identification, outperforming other classification methods. While our results are promising, several challenges still need to be addressed. For example, the quality of the input images can significantly impact the accuracy of gender identification. In addition, the model may be biased towards certain styles of handwriting or writing instruments. Future work in this area could focus on improving the quality of the input images or exploring ways to mitigate bias in the model. Our proposed method for gender identification and classification from handwritten images using SVM with PCA is a promising approach with potential applications in the fields such as forensic analysis, document processing, and automated handwriting recognition. Further research in this area could lead to more accurate and effective methods for gender identification and classification from handwritten data.

AB In this paper, we propose a scheme for autonomous exploration in unknown environments using a mobile robot. To reduce the storage consumption and speed up the search of frontiers, we propose a wave-features-based rapidly exploring random tree method, which can inhibit or promote the growth of sampling trees regionally. Then, we prune the frontiers with mean shift algorithm and use the pruned frontiers for decision-making. To avoid the repeated exploration, we develop a decision making method with consistency assessment, in which the status of the robot and frontiers are explicitly encoded and modeled as a fixed start open traveling salesman problem (FSOTSP). Furthermore, a re-decision mechanism is build to reduce the extra computing cost. Simulations and real-world experiments show the significant improvement of the proposed scheme.

DE Boundary extension; Collision avoidance; Manipulator; Path planning;
   Rapidly exploring random tree-fixed node (RRT*FN); Various scenarios
AB In this article, we present a new path planning algorithm based on the rapidly exploring random tree-fixed node (RRT*FN) algorithm for manipulators. It addresses the problem that RRT*FN complex environment processing is not fast enough to meet real-time requirements, and RRT*FN is basically impossible to search for an effective manipulator path in a narrow-channel environment. In the new path planning algorithm, a heuristic sampling method is adopted and the leaf nodes outside the ellipsoids are preferentially deleted to address the node removal problem, resulting in better search paths and faster search speeds. When the nodes are expanded, new nodes are generated due to goal gravity and random point gravity, with the weight values dynamically adjusted via dichotomy, and the new nodes are expanded to the goal point twice to more rapidly obtain a tree extension direction that is closer to the goal point. For boundary points, the issues of narrow channels and stepped obstacles can be effectively solved by extending the local environment sampling boundaries. To optimize the paths, the redundant intermediate nodes are simplified based on the triangle inequality. Simulation analyses show that the proposed planner can adapt to a variety of scenarios in real time while satisfying optimal path conditions.

AB Traveling salesman problem with drone (TSPD) is an expansion of the conventional traveling salesman problem, in which parcels are delivered to consumers not only by vehicles but also by drones. The traditional algorithm is difficult to develop when dealing with the dynamic and complex route environment, and the solving time and accuracy cannot meet the needs of modern logistics. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has the advantages of large-scale decision making, self-adaptation, and online optimization, so it has been widely used. Instead of employing traditional algorithms to solve the TSPD, we propose a hybrid graph network model for the TSPD that is based on the DRL mechanism. By taking advantage of different network modules, the DRL model can improve its search performance in solution space. The experimental results show that our model outperforms a solely attention-based model in terms of solution quality and computing efficiency. In addition, our model has better generalization ability compared with the current DRL models.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Regression modeling; Extreme learning machine; Adaptive loss function;
   Bayesian optimization; Iterative reweighted least squares
AB The extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is advantageous to regression modeling owing to its simple structure, fast computation, and good generalization performance. However, the existing ELM algorithm uses an l(2)-norm loss function, which is sensitive to outliers and has low robustness. In addition, some existing robust loss functions are not sufficiently flexible to accurately estimate the relationship between sample points and loss values, resulting in unsatisfactory ELM performance. To address these problems, this study established a robust ELM (ALFELM) algorithm. First, an adaptive loss function with two tunable hyperparameters was introduced; the function can be transformed into several robust loss functions by varying the parameters. It overcomes the limitations of fixed robust loss functions. Then, the Bayesian optimization strategy was used to determine the optimal parameters of the loss function. Furthermore, the classical iterative reweighted least squares method was used to solve for output weights, with a weight function corresponding to the loss function and a regularization parameter to prevent overfitting. Finally, the proposed method was tested using several artificial and benchmark datasets, and its effectiveness was verified for a real engineering case. The results indicated that the proposed ALFELM algorithm is more robust and accurate compared with other methods, especially for a large number of outliers. In addition, the algorithm can be used to establish effective regression models for actual processes.

TI Improved interval type-2 fuzzy K-means clustering based on adaptive

DE Fuzzy k-means; Interval type-2 fuzzy sets; Type-reduction method;

ID ROUGH SET-THEORY; INFORMATION FUSION; ALGORITHM
AB Interval Type-2 Fuzzy K-means (IT2FKM) is an efficient clustering algorithm, which mainly focuses on further describes the uncertainty of the data sets by introducing interval type2 fuzzy membership function. Since the estimation center obtained by two membership functions is an interval type-1 fuzzy set, it is necessary to use the defuzzification method to obtain a crisp cluster center. The existing IT2FKM algorithms adopt the generalized centroid method (GC) in the process of type-reduction and defuzzification for iterative clustering center. But unfortunately, this method simply uses a single numerical value 0.5 as the type-reduction coefficient to balance and synthesize for the left value and the right value of an interval cluster center, while ignoring the distribution of the clusters. This defect makes IT2FKM fail to update the optimal cluster center when facing with imbalanced clusters, which affect the accuracy in some cases. To address this failing, in this paper, some adverse effects caused by generalized centroid method when facing with imbalanced clusters are analyzed in detail. Thereafter, an improved type-reduction method of iterative cluster centers for IT2FKM clustering is proposed considering the imbalanced clustering distributions. On the basis of which, an enhanced IT2FKM algorithm is further developed. The enhanced IT2FKM algorithm has an average classification accuracy of 97.5% when faced with four datasets with different degrees imbalance, which is about 3.25% higher than other clustering algorithms. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm are further demonstrated by some experimental analysis of UCI standard datasets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE Polyp detection; YOLO; CNNs; Medical imaging; Colorectal cancer
ID COLONOSCOPY; LOCALIZATION
AB More than 900000 deaths were caused by Colorectal Cancer (CRC) in 2020. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening, with studies concluding that colonoscopies significantly reduce mortality from CRC. It has been shown in the literature that computer-aided detection (CAD) systems can improve adenoma detection. In particular, deep learning models have shown promising results in helping physicians reduce the number of missed lesions during real-time colonoscopies. To keep up with the increase in resolution of the colonoscopies and to perform inference in real-time in smaller medical devices, faster models (i.e., models that can process images at high frame rates) are required. In this work, we use YOLOv4 to detect polyps, which are known to be CRC precursors. To further increase the inference speed of the model, achieve real-time performance, and make the model smaller, we deployed it on NVIDIA TensorRT, which optimizes and quantizes the model using different floating-point and integer representation levels down to 8-bit. Different methods of regularization, data pre-processing, and data augmentation were tested. An analysis of various data augmentation methods was conducted, where we individually tested these techniques by stacking them on top of previously used ones and assessed the improvements. The effects of transfer learning, using custom anchor boxes, the usage of different optimizers, Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization (CBN), and Distance-Intersection Over Union Non-Maximum Suppression (DIOU-NMS) were equally analyzed. We used publicly available datasets to train, test, and validate our model to facilitate comparison to other studies. To evaluate the inference speed, a publicly available video dataset was used. We achieved 82.93% for mAP, 81.44% for precision, 75.96% for recall in the Etis-Larib dataset, and 90.96% for mAP, 88.65% for precision, 87.62% for recall, 88.23% for F1, and 87.86% for F2 using the CVC-ClinicDB dataset. Using an NVIDIA RTX 2080TI graphics processing unit (GPU), a speed of approximately 98 frames per second (FPS) was obtained on three videos from the Colonoscopic video dataset. For the FP16 version of the implementation, the inference speed increased to 163 FPS. For the INT8 version of the model, the inference speed was further increased to approximately 172 FPS. An important conclusion was that for FP16 and INT8 levels of quantization, the accuracy metrics for the model did not suffer much degradation and, in some cases, even increased performance, thus suggesting that a regularization effect can occur when using quantization. This implies that the network may become smaller, faster, and more precise (which could prove to be essential for resource-constrained devices) and that quantization might also be used as a regularization technique. Also, data augmentation techniques proved crucial to overcoming the lack of labeled data, which often happens in the medical field due to privacy reasons.

AB In the past few decades, feedforward neural networks have gained much attraction in their hardware implementations. However, when we realize a neural network in analog circuits, the circuit-based model is sensitive to hardware nonidealities. The nonidealities, such as random offset voltage drifts and thermal noise, may lead to variation in hidden neurons and further affect neural behaviors. This paper considers that time-varying noise exists at the input of hidden neurons, with zero-mean Gaussian distribution. First, we derive lower and upper bounds on the mean square error loss to estimate the inherent noise tolerance of a noise-free trained feedforward network. Then, the lower bound is extended for any non-Gaussian noise cases based on the Gaussian mixture model concept. The upper bound is generalized for any non-zero-mean noise case. As the noise could degrade the neural performance, a new network architecture is designed to suppress the noise effect. This noise-resilient design does not require any training process. We also discuss its limitation and give a closed-form expression to describe the noise tolerance when the limitation is exceeded. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Selection of relevant features is vitally important in machine learning tasks involving large datasets with numerous features. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of a dataset and improving model performance. This study introduces a feature selection technique named mu-Relief, which is based on ReliefF, one of the most extensively used Relief-based algorithms. mu-Relief effectively determines the most relevant feature subset and significantly outperforms the ReliefF algorithm. ReliefF estimates feature quality considering only the nearest neighbors, resulting in low classification accuracy on non-uniformly distributed or noisy datasets. The proposed mu-Relief technique considers neighbors with more effective information on the basis of mean distance. It utilizes neighbors far from the mean distance to obtain feature weight estimates, which improves the algorithm's performance. The algorithm was tested on thirteen real-world datasets and validated on three synthetic datasets. Its effectiveness in selecting relevant features was evaluated by comparing it to other well-known feature selection algorithms, namely Chi-Square, ANOVA, MI, CMIM, MRMR, SURF*, MultiSURF, MultiSURF*, and ReliefF. When evaluated using multiple classifiers trained on the features selected by different feature selection techniques, the metrics of classification accuracy, weighted F1-score, and ROC-AUC, showed that mu-Relief effectively determined relevant features and outperformed other techniques.

DE Accompaniment generation; Flow-based model; New pianoroll; Deep learning
AB Arranging and orchestration are critical aspects of music composition and production. Traditional accompaniment arranging is time-consuming and requires expertise in music theory. In this work, we utilize a deep learning model, the flow model, to generate music accompaniment including drums, guitar, bass, and strings based on the input piano melody, which can assist musicians in creating popular music. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) We propose a new pianoroll representation that solves the problem of recognizing the onset of a musical note and saves space. 2) We introduce the MuseFlow accompaniment generation model, which can generate multi-track, polyphonic music accompaniment. To the best of our knowledge, MuseFlow is the first flow-based music generation model. 3) We incorporate a sliding window into the model to enable long sequence music generation, breaking the length limitation. Comparisons on datasets such as LDP, FreeMidi, and GPMD verify the effectiveness of the model. MuseFlow produces better results in accompaniment quality and inter-track harmony. Additionally, the note pitch and duration distributions of the generated accompaniment are much closer to the real data.

AB Fine-grained visual classification aims to identify images that belong to multiple subcategories within the same category. This is a challenging task as there are only subtle regional differences between subcategories. Most of the existing methods utilize neural networks to extract global image features and quickly lock local feature regions by adding various external attention mechanisms. This type of approach may ignore the details that are inherent in the feature map itself. This paper proposes an efficient global channel position-aware interaction method to solve this problem. Specifically, we first hierarchically group the original features and take advantage of the translation-invariant linearity and local weight sharing of convolutional networks to propose a hierarchical structure that enhances the receptive field of global features. Then, same-direction location attention interaction is performed based on the global feature with rich fields of view, thus encouraging the model to capture its common areas of interest according to the feature's own learning ability. Finally, multiple attention feature map is obtained based on the relative position interactions of the global features. We again use convolutional networks to learn the discriminative features of the attention target regions and perform feature clustering optimization on the discriminative feature regions to guide the classification process. The proposed model performs well on three datasets, i.e. CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, and FGVC Aircraft.

ID SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION
AB Monocular Visual Odometry (VO) is often formulated as a sequential dynamics problem that relies on scene rigidity assumption. One of the main challenges is rejecting moving objects and estimating camera pose in dynamic environments. Existing methods either take the visual cues in the whole image equally or eliminate the fixed semantic categories by heuristics or attention mechanisms. However, they fail to tackle unknown dynamic objects which are not labeled in the training sets of the network. To solve these issues, we propose a novel framework, named graph attention network (GAT)-optimized dynamic monocular visual odometry (GDM-VO), to remove dynamic objects explicitly with semantic segmentation and multi-view geometry in this paper. Firstly, we employ a multi-task learning network to perform semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Then, we reject priori known and unknown objective moving objects through semantic information and multi-view geometry, respectively. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first to leverage GAT to capture long-range temporal dependencies from consecutive image sequences adaptively, while existing sequential modeling approaches need to select information manually. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and TUM datasets demonstrate the superior performance of GDM-VO overs existing state-of-the-art classical and learning-based monocular VO.

DE Knowledge graph completion; Position-aware learning; Masked elements
   reconstruction
AB Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide supportively structured knowledge and have been applied to various downstream applications. Given a large amount of incomplete knowledge in KGs, knowledge graph completion (KGC) is proposed to reason over known facts and infer the missing links. The previous graph embedding approaches learn graph structure (i.e., triple structure/neighborhood structure) but cannot handle unseen entities, which is addressed by textual encoding approaches that utilize the textual knowledge of graph elements (i.e., entities/relations). However, the previous textual encoding approaches only resort to triples and thus cannot exploit the knowledge of neighbors, which provides abundant evidence to facilitate prediction. Moreover, they are insensitive to changes in the position of elements in triples when performing text modeling, and thus cannot effectively distinguish triples with the same elements but completely different semantics, which is detrimental to the final result. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel Structure-Enhanced and Position-Aware Knowledge Embedding (SEPAKE) framework. Specifically, masked elements reconstruction is devised to predict missing elements by reasoning over the contexts of subgraphs. As such, we incorporate the graph structure while maintaining the feature that textual information can be encoded. Meanwhile, position-aware learning is conducted to capture the semantic knowledge implied by the relative positions of elements in textualization. In addition, we employ task-specific adapters to store knowledge in a unified way to facilitate the storage and transfer of knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, and we achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets compared with textual encoding approaches. Besides, our proposed framework can efficiently improve the previous approaches by optionally pluggable adapters, further verifying the advancement and applicability of our work.

AB As a demonstrated and foremost approach of extracting the key features from corrupted observations, tensor robust principal component analysis has been considered in various fields of data processing related to tensors. It is usually modeled as a low-rank and sparse tensor decomposition problem and can be solved by minimizing a simple convex program. However, convex optimization methods often fail to deeply explore the rank and sparsity of tensors, which leads to suboptimality. Based on tensor singular value decomposition, in this work, we introduce generalized nonconvex regularizers accommodating most popular nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) surrogate functions to be used as effective approximations of the tensor rank function and t0-norm. The established unified frame equips universality for a large group of nonconvex surrogate functions. Moreover, we consider tube-wise sparse noise in addition to entry-wise sparse noise, which provides a better way of handling structured corrupted observations arising from practical issues. We further develop an efficient algorithm with convergence guarantees to implement generalized nonconvex optimization based upon the alternating direction method of multipliers. The satisfactory performance results of the proposed method are verified by simulations and visual inpainting applications.

AB Session-based recommender systems (SBRS) play a crucial role in predicting the next click of a user from anonymous session data on numerous online platforms such as e-commerce, music, etc. However, predicting the next click is a very challenging task within the session, as it contains a very little amount of contextual information. Most of the existing techniques consider a session like a sequence of items to make recommendations and ignore the complex transition between items. In order to get accurate item embeddings and capture the complex transitions of items, we have proposed a Minimal Gated Unit based Graph Neural Network (MGU-GNN) for the session-based recommendation (SBR) tasks. We have also integrated a soft-attention network and target-based interest-aware network module, called MGU-GNN-TAR. The target-based interest-aware network module adapts to varying users' interests in terms of the items to be targeted. The soft-attention network module adapts long-term priorities and current session interest for better prediction of the user's next item or action. This model provides precise item embedding by incorporating the complex item transitions. The proposed model uses a gated mechanism called the Minimal Gated Unit, which has a single gate, and due to this reason, the parameters have been reduced to 67% as compared to the GRU cell. A GRU cell is the most basic of all gated hidden units. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models, comprehensive experiments on four most commonly used publicly available real-world datasets have been performed, and they show that the proposed models routinely beat baseline methods and state-of-the-art SBR techniques on all four datasets.

AB The world has recently been exposed to a fierce attack from many viral diseases, such as Covid-19, that exhausted medical systems around the world. Such attack had a negative impact not only on the health status of people or the high death rate, but also had a bad impact on the economic situation, which affected all countries of the world especially the poor and the developing ones. Monkeypox is one of the latest viral diseases that may cause a pandemic in the near future if not dealt and diagnosed with appropriately. This paper provides a new strategy for diagnosing monkeypox, which is called; Accurate Monkeypox Diagnosing Strategy (AMDS). The proposed AMDS consists of two phases, which are; (i) pre-processing and (ii) classification. During the pre-processing phase, the most effective feature are selected using Binary Tiki-Taka Algorithm (BTTA). On the other hand, in the classification phase, ensemble classification is used for diagnosing new cases, which combines evidence from three different new classifiers, namely; (a) Layered K-Nearest Neighbors (LKNN), (b) Statistical Naive Bayes (SNB), and (c) Deep Learning Classifier (DLC). Moreover, the decisions of the proposed classifiers are merged in a new voting scheme called Fuzzified Voting Scheme (FVS). AMDS has been compared against recent diagnostic strategies. Experimental results have proven that AMDS outperforms other monkeypox diagnostic strategies as it introduces the most accurate diagnosis according to two different datasets.

This article develops an efficient and accurate system that uses artificial neural networks (ANN), feature selection (FS) methods, and multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques to diagnose heart disease. Appropriate features are selected by utilizing five feature selection methods. Then, three artificial neural networks for CVD prediction were implemented, and their performances were checked according to eight solid criteria. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) has been utilized to select the optimal hyperparameters to reach high accuracy. A novel integrated weighting method using MEREC and BWM is developed to consider experts' statements and data evaluation in the criteria weighting operation to choose the best feature selection-artificial neural network method for heart disease detection. Then, an extended version of ELECTRE III is introduced to assess fifteen alternatives, which has proven to be more accurate than other ELECTRE methods in this research. Results validation has been done by utilizing eight MCDM techniques, the Pearson correlation coefficient test, and criteria weights sensitivity analysis by implementing ten scenarios to assess our methodology's robustness. Finally, the outcomes indicate that LASSO-CNN, AdaBoost-CNN, and AdaBoost-MLP are the top 3 approaches with the accuracy of 99.51%, 98.54%, and 98.54%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest accuracy rates obtained in the literature so far.

AB Chloride diffusion in concrete is a complex chemo-physical process and it is of pivotal importance to forecast the initiation time of corrosion. But limited equations are accessible to simulate the chloride diffusion considering the nonlinear chloride binding capacity of concrete. This study proposes a physics-informed deep neural network to simulate the chloride diffusion mechanism and forecast the distribution of chloride concentrations in concrete. Physical laws are formulated as a loss term to guide the training process and to mitigate the data required for model training. The physical constraint loss (based on the governing equation and boundary conditions) and the training loss (based on the neural network) are then fused to produce the loss function. Different experimental cases are first employed to validate the proposed model and then the model is compared to numerical applications and purely data-driven approaches. Results revealed that the proposed model could effectively simulate the chloride transport behavior and forecast the diffusion coefficient of concrete with high precision over other states of art methods. The application of this method to the temporal and spatial domains of the chloride concentration within the concrete samples showed its potential as a powerful tool for investigating concrete properties.

TI Pruning-and-distillation: One-stage joint compression framework for CNNs
   via clustering

LA English
DT Article
DE Filter pruning; Clustering; Knowledge distillation; Deep neural networks
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Network pruning and knowledge distillation, as two effective network compression techniques, have drawn extensive attention due to their success in reducing model complexity. However, previous works regard them as two independent methods and combine them in an isolated manner rather than joint, leading to a sub-optimal optimization. In this paper, we propose a collaborative compression scheme named Pruningand-Distillation via Clustering (PDC), which integrates pruning and distillation into an end-to-end single-stage framework that takes both advantages of them. Specifically, instead of directly deleting or zeroing out unimportant filters within each layer, we reconstruct them based on clustering, which preserves the learned features as much as possible. The guidance from the teacher is integrated into the pruning process to further improve the generalization of pruned model, which alleviates the randomness caused by reconstruction to some extent. After convergence, we can equivalently remove reconstructed filters within each cluster through the proposed channel addition operation. Benefiting from such equivalence, we no longer require the time-consuming finetuning step to regain accuracy. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves the best trade-off between performance and complexity compared with other state-of-theart algorithms. For example, for ResNet-110, we achieve a 61.5% FLOPs reduction with even 0.14% top-1 accuracy increase on CIFAR-10 and remove 55.2% FLOPs with only 0.32% accuracy drop on CIFAR-100. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID GRADIENT DESCENT; CONVERGENCE
AB Stochastic momentum methods are widely used to solve stochastic optimization problems in machine learning. However, most of the existing theoretical analyses rely on either bounded assumptions or strong stepsize conditions. In this paper, we focus on a class of non-convex objective functions satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition and present a unified convergence rate analysis for stochastic momentum methods without any bounded assumptions, which covers stochastic heavy ball (SHB) and stochastic Nesterov accelerated gradient (SNAG). Our analysis achieves the more challenging last-iterate convergence rate of function values under the relaxed growth (RG) condition, which is a weaker assumption than those used in related work. Specifically, we attain the sub-linear rate for stochastic momentum methods with diminishing stepsizes, and the linear convergence rate for constant stepsizes if the strong growth (SG) condition holds. We also examine the iteration complexity for obtaining an & epsilon;-accurate solution of the last-iterate. Moreover, we provide a more flexible stepsize scheme for stochastic momentum methods in three points: (i) relaxing the last-iterate convergence stepsize from square summable to zero limitation; (ii) extending the minimum-iterate convergence rate stepsize to the non-monotonic case; (iii) expanding the last-iterate convergence rate stepsize to a more general form. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on benchmark datasets to validate our theoretical findings.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Image moments are image descriptors widely utilized in several image processing, pattern recognition, computer vision, and multimedia security applications. In the era of big data, the computation of image moments yields a huge memory demand, especially for large moment order and/or high-resolution images (i.e., megapixel images). The state-of-the-art moment computation methods successfully accelerate the image moment computation for digital images of a resolution smaller than 1K x 1K pixels. For digital images of higher resolutions, image moment computation is problematic. Researchers utilized GPU-based parallel processing to overcome this problem. In practice, the parallel computation of image moments using GPUs encounters the non-extended memory problem, which is the main challenge. This paper proposed a recurrent-based method for computing the Polar Complex Exponent Transform (PCET) moments of fractional orders. The proposed method utilized the symmetry of the image kernel to reduce kernel computation. In the proposed method, once a kernel value is computed in one quaternion, the other three corresponding values in the remaining three quaternions can be trivially computed. Moreover, the proposed method utilized recurrence equations to compute kernels. Thus, the required memory to store the pre-computed memory is saved. Finally, we implemented the proposed method on the GPU parallel architecture. The proposed method overcomes the memory limit due to saving the kernel's memory. The experiments show that the proposed parallel-friendly and memory-efficient method is superior to the state-of-the-art moment computation methods in memory consumption and runtimes. The proposed method computes the PCET moment of order 50 for an image of size 2K x 2K pixels in 3.5 seconds while the state-of-the-art method of comparison needs 7.0 seconds to process the same image, the memory requirements for the proposed method and the method of comparison for the were 67.0 MB and 3.4 GB, respectively. The method of comparison could not compute the image moment for any image with a resolution higher than 2K x 2K pixels. In contrast, the proposed method managed to compute the image moment up to 16K x 16K pixels image. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The efficient coordination of directional overcurrent relays is a challenging problem. Recent papers in the literature have focused on developing efficient algorithms to solve this issue. However, there is a lack of reporting practical procedures that affects the mathematical formulation to ensure accurate outputs by any optimization algorithm. In this paper, we show a comprehensive procedure that considers mutually coupled circuits via Graph Theory, the requirements of short-circuit current calculation, contingencies to be considered as well as the setting of Instantaneous Overcurrent (IOC) and Time Overcurrent (TOC) units, both for phase and ground protection. The simulation has been carried out by using a real electric network and C++ language programming. Computational simulation has shown the performance of the method, which provides high-quality solutions, with adequate coordination of the selected protective devices that increase the efficiency in setting this type of protection with safety. Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) outperformed conventional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the best metaheuristic for optimally minimizing the proposed problem, achieving faster convergence times for the phase overcurrent protection scenario (16.36 s vs. 22.27 s and 17.03 s, respectively), and also for the ground overcurrent protection scenario (19.87 s vs. 20.44 s and 20.11 s, respectively).

AB High-accuracy positioning and identification of transmission line components is the premise for their status detection and fault diagnosis. However, due to the limitations of imbalance object scale and distribution in aerial images, the problem of detecting dense-tiny objects still needs to be solved. Considering the prior knowledge of fixed connection scenes, we proposed a novel method named scene iterative reasoning network (SIRN) based on self-adaptive clustering and local scene knowledge. It consists of the coarse-grained detector (CGD), scene self-adaptive clustering (SSAC) subnetwork, and scene structure iterative reasoning (SSIR) subnetwork. The CGD was proposed to obtain global coarse detection results. Then, the SSAC subnetwork utilized unsupervised self-adaptive clustering to obtain accurate dense regions based on the CGD results. Finally, the SSIR subnetwork was designed to extract and fuse the scene semantic structure information of local regions for realizing accurate dense-tiny object detection. In summary, the SIRN model utilizes an iterative inference strategy to detect dense regions accurately. By leveraging scene structure information, the model effectively transforms the challenge of detecting dense objects into an advantage, resulting in precise detection. The SIRN model is compatible with single-stage and two-stage object detection models, achieving a notable mean average precision (mAP) improvement ranging from 4.4% to 12.2% compared to the baseline models. Compared to other state-of-the-art object detection models, SIRN demonstrates significant advantages in accuracy and error rate metrics. In addition, qualitative and quantitative experiments show that the SIRN model considerably enhanced the detection of dense-tiny objects.

AB The distributed flow shop group scheduling problem (DFGSP) has wide industrial applications. Due to the strong coupling of DFGSP, three issues should be solved, such as assigning groups to factories, arranging the sequence of groups in each factory and scheduling the sequence of jobs in each group. Meanwhile, the calculation for the objective has a high time complexity. To solve the above problems, we first build a mixed -integer linear programming model of DFGSP and verify its correctness by using the Gurobi solver. By exploring the implicit characteristics of the problem, two rapid evaluation methods based on group insertion and job insertion are designed to accelerate the evaluation of the objective. Then, an effective two-stage iterated greedy algorithm (tIGA) is proposed to solve the above three coupled subproblem. In the proposed tIGA, two intra-factory and inter-factory cooperative neighborhood search strategies and two intra-group and inter-group enhanced search strategies are proposed, respectively, to improve the search breadth and depth. The results of comprehensive statistical experiments on 810 test instances show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the compared ones in terms of objective values and relative percentage increase values, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed tIGA.

AB Most image encryption techniques are proposed to be applied to the whole image, which lacks the focus of information value. In this paper, we propose a target-based image encryption scheme. For remotely sensed airport images, we first take the aircraft considered to be sensitive information as the target and detect its positions. And then perform the proposed three-dimensional bit disorder method (3DBDM) and the arbitrary point dynamic diffusion on these regions. Finally, encrypt the entire image through high-speed index-dynamic diffusion to improve efficiency. To obtain a more stable key stream, a new ill-conditioned parameter infinite-interval chaotic system (IPIS) is introduced. The evaluation of IPIS shows that the introduction of ill-conditioned matrix brings higher sensitivity, randomness, and wider chaotic interval, which potentially improves the security of chaotic image encryption. In particular, the encryption method for aircraft regions can be generalized to ordinary images. Various encryption effect tests verify the security and practicability of the proposed algorithm and targetbased encryption scheme.

AB In this paper, we investigate a novel framework for achieving prescribed-time (PAT), fixed-time (FXT) and finite-time (FNT) stochastic synchronization control of semi-Markov switching quaternion-valued neural networks (SMS-QVNNs), where the setting time (ST) of PAT/FXT/FNT stochastic synchronization control is effectively preassigned beforehand and estimated. Different from the existing frameworks of PAT/FXT/FNT control and PAT/FXT control (where PAT control is deeply dependent on FXT control, meaning that if the FXT control task is removed, it is impossible to implement the PAT control task), and different from the existing frameworks of PAT control (where a time-varying control gain such as & mu;(t) = T/(T - t) with t & ISIN; [0, T) was employed, leading to an unbounded control gain as t & RARR; T- from the initial time to prescribed time T), the investigated framework is only built on a control strategy, which can accomplish its three control tasks (PAT/FXT/FNT control), and the control gains are bounded even though time t tends to the prescribed time T. Four numerical examples and an application of image encryption/decryption are given to illustrate the feasibility of our proposed framework.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Image registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recently, learning based image registration methods have made great progress. However, these methods are sensitive to abnormal transformation and have insufficient robustness, which leads to more mismatched points in the actual environment. In this paper, we propose a new registration framework based on ensemble learning and dynamic adaptive kernel. Specifically, we first use a dynamic adaptive kernel to extract deep features at the coarse level to guide fine-level registration. Then we added an adaptive feature pyramid network based on the integrated learning principle to realize the fine-level feature extraction. Through different scale, receptive fields, not only the local geometric information of each point is considered, but also its low texture information at the pixel level is considered. According to the actual registration environment, fine features are adaptively obtained to reduce the sensitivity of the model to abnormal transformation. We use the global receptive field provided in the transformer to obtain feature descriptors based on these two levels. In addition, we use the cosine loss directly defined on the corresponding relationship to train the network and balance the samples, to achieve feature point registration based on the corresponding relationship. Extensive experiments on object-level and scene level datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by a large margin. More critically, it has the best generalization ability in unknown scenes with different sensor modes.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SCHEME
AB The detection and segmentation of cerebral aneurysms is a crucial step in the development of a clinical decision support system for estimating aneurysm rupture risk. However, accurately identifying and segmenting regions of interest in two-dimensional (2D) medical images is often challenging, particularly when using deep learning (DL) methods on small datasets with limited annotated data. The accuracy of DL approaches is often affected by the availability of large, annotated training datasets that are required for effective deep learning. Additionally, when using DL to differentiate aneurysms from arterial loops in 2D DSA images, DL can fail to detect aneurysms in areas where dye concentration is low. To address these issues and enhance the reliability and accuracy of aneurysm detection and segmentation methods, incorporating medical expert-advised, hand-crafted features can provide a clinical perspective to DL methods. This approach can help to improve the performance of DL methods by providing additional information that is not captured in the data. To this end, a novel Neuro-symbolic AI-based DeepInfusion model is proposed which allows for the infusion of human intellect through handcrafted features into deep neural networks (DNNs), thus combining the strengths of DL with the knowledge and expertise of medical professionals. The proposed approach includes a novel technique for dynamic layer selection and feature weight adjustment during the model infusion process. The performance of the DeepInfusion model is evaluated on an in-house prepared dataset of 409 DSA images, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the segmentation of cerebral aneurysms. The model achieves an IOU score of 96.76% and an F1-score of 94.15% on unseen DSA images. The model is also tested on two publicly available datasets of Kvasir-SEG polyp and DRIVE for vessel segmentation of retinal images. The results show a significant improvement compared to existing methods, which indicates the generalizability of the approach in medical segmentation. The complete code for DeepInfusion is available on our GitHub repository at https://github.com/smileslab/deep-infusion/blob/main/deepinfusion.ipynb.

AB Aspect level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to identify the sentiment polarity of one or more given aspects in a sentence. In natural language, words frequently carry certain sentimental tendencies, which can be beneficial in obtaining the features between aspects and contexts. On the other hand, the dependencies between different aspects in a sentence can provide sufficient information for the sentiment polarity discrimination of a target aspect. However, existing models tend to focus on sentiment knowledge or aspect interactions individually without leveraging their converged information. Therefore, we propose a model based on Gated Mechanism Fusing Sentiment Knowledge and Inter-Aspect dependency (GMF-SKIA) for Aspect-level Sentiment Classification in this paper, aiming to dynamically fuse sentiment knowledge information of words and inter-aspect dependency. Specifically, the model uses the SenticNet sentiment dictionary to add sentiment knowledge information to words during dependency tree construction, and then we introduce a graph convolutional network to obtain sentiment information of dependency tree. We utilize an aspect-related multiheaded self-attention mechanism to model the inter-aspect interactions. Moreover, we design an information gate based on gated mechanism to fuse sentiment knowledge and inter-aspect features. We performed experiments on four publicly available datasets, our model outperforms the best benchmark model by an average of 2.1% and achieves the highest accuracy of 91.56% on the Rest16 dataset. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The recent wave of elections won by right-wing worldwide brings up increased discussions biased by political polarization, including in social media. Social media data enables the investigation of the contexts where political polarization occurs, enabling to derive insights into how it affects human behavior. Related work has shown how computing techniques can be leveraged to understand political polarization in restricted scenarios, but the complexity of this behavior can be better understood when considered from different viewpoints. This article describes a multi-dimensional analysis framework to study the behavior of groups on Twitter in politically polarized scenarios. It can be applied to various themes where groups display stances that can be politically biased, and it aggregates a wide range of computational techniques in an innovative way to provide rich insights. The framework includes guidelines and techniques to: (a) collect data on Twitter to represent the groups; (b) automatically infer the political leaning of users; (c) derive topological properties of the groups' social network and analyze political influence; (d) identify topics representing concerns at coarse and fine-grained granularity levels using a hybrid topic modeling approach; (e) identify psychological aspects based on linguistic cues, and (f) analyze the sources of information disseminated by the groups. Applying the framework in two case studies related to COVID-19 revealed patterns of behavior common to ideologies. We confirmed that the stances were politically motivated and that both groups, left/right, were subject to the echo chamber effect. Comparatively, the social structure of the right-oriented groups is more connected, and they rely on politicians and social media for information spreading. Left-oriented groups are less connected and more prone to facts. The psychological aspects reveal that both groups are emotionally distressed in arguing about being right, given their beliefs.

AB Ultrasound image segmentation plays a vital role in the early diagnosis of human diseases. It helps diagnose many diseases, such as breast cancer, hemangioma, and other gynecological disorders. However, the intrinsic imaging characteristics of ultrasound images result in substantially lower resolution and clarity than CT, MRI, and other imaging modalities, and they are sensitive to interference from external influences. With its inherent artifacts, blurred lesion boundaries, and uneven intensity distribution, ultrasound images present a challenging task when it comes to segmenting lesion areas accurately. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, CNNs are limited in capturing the remote dependencies of the input image, leading to degraded accuracy in segmenting ultrasound lesions. In this paper, we developed a deep convolutional neural network that incorporates the pseudo-color enhancement algorithm and hybrid attention modules that enhance the network's ability to extract fine features and remote modeling capabilities. We propose a novel multi-scale channel attention-based decoder that efficiently uses the feature maps from the encoder as a complement and fuses them with the upsampled feature maps. The hybrid attention combination captures cross-channel interactions efficiently and enhances the context modeling capability, further improving the extraction of coarse and delicate features, and resulting in significant performance improvements. We found that the dice performance improved by 2.54%, 2.47%, 1.39%, 0.99%, and 1.23% on the BUL, BUSI, Hemangioma, BP, and VUI. Results from four public datasets and one self-collected dataset indicate that the proposed method outperforms other medical image segmentation methods for ultrasound image lesion segmentation.

AB Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gain success for recommendation, but still face great challenges of data sparseness and negative sampling in implicit feedback-based recommendation. In particular, they ignore the unique graph structure for information propagation and thus fail to fully explore the potentials of GCN.To tackle the problem, we propose a GCN-based self-training approach, called STL, which exploits the learning results in the training procedure, and the potential relations in the embedding space of GCN. First, to handle the data sparsity, we modify the interaction graph structure by adding edges linking a selected part of users and their potential positive items. Second, we adaptively expand the set of positive samples that are used in the pairwise loss function, which not only supplements the dataset but also avoids sampling noises. Further, similarity of structural neighbors on graph is used to mine hard negative sample for improving the sample quality. Experiments on three representative GCN-based recommenders and four widely used public datasets show that STL alleviates the problem of data sparsity, thereby improving recommendation performance compared to normal training.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Weighted harmonic mean; Pairwise strategy
ID FEATURES
AB Multiview subspace learning (MvSL) has attracted extensive research interest in many real-world applications, e.g., pattern recognition and computer vision. Existing MvSL approaches seek a discriminant common subspace by simultaneously maximizing the arithmetic mean of the between-class covariance and minimizing the global average of the within-class covariance. However, the arithmetic mean normally assigns equal weight to all between-class distances. Then, classes with small distances overlap with each other, and the largest between-class distance dominates the common subspace. In addition, the global average of within-class covariance (which is computed by the sum of within-class distances for all classes) significantly differs from the within-class covariance of a single class. This will inevitably cause the internal details of each class to be ignored and lead to lower recognition accuracy. To circumvent these issues, we develop a productive strategy to take more consideration of the relationship between any two classes and propose a novel Multiview Latent Structure Learning (MvLSL) model, which incorporates the weighted harmonic mean of pairwise between-class scatter and pairwise within-class scatter. Due to the adjustable dimensions of the common subspace, MvLSL can be naturally extended for dimensionality reduction (DR), and we utilize a reconstruction term to suppress data degradation and improve the DR performance. Our models are tested on six benchmark datasets with five evaluation criteria and compared with existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating our models' effectiveness and superiority.

ID NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; SCALE
AB Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have achieved remarkable performances in multi-view clustering due to their effectiveness and efficiency. To better obtain a low-dimensional common representation, the limited labels and the geometric structure of the multi-view data should be fully utilized in clustering. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-view learning approach, dubbed label-embedded regularized NMF with dual-graph constraints (LeNMF-DC), for clustering. Our proposed LeNMF-DC approach mainly utilizes matrix factorization to obtain a low-dimensional common representation of the multi-view data, in which the prior knowledge hidden in data can be fully explored. Specifically, we construct three graph regularization terms to preserve the manifold structure in the data, feature and label space, respectively. Moreover, we take advantage of the labels of the labeled samples without additional parameters. In addition, we develop an alternate iterative optimization scheme to solve the model of LeNMF-DC and then show its convergence rate. Compared with traditional multi-view clustering approaches, the labels of unlabeled samples in our proposed LeNMF-DC approach are assigned by the label constraint matrix rather than the clustering algorithm, and thus it avoids performance loss during the clustering. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets manifest that our LeNMF-DC approach can achieve superior performances than several state-of-the-art approaches in multi-view clustering. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Malachite Green (MG) adsorption by four different bio-adsorbents: Populus Nigra (PN), Pinus Strobus (PS), Fraxinus Excelsior (FE), and Phragmites Australis (PA) have been investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were conducted to identify the bio-ad-sorbents' characterization and study their adsorptive properties. The impact of essential factors, such as adsorbent dosage, initial solution pH, initial MG concentration, and interaction of factors were studied on removal efficiency by face centered design (CCF) as a feature of response surface methodology (RSM). Nonlinear kinetic models including pseudo-first, and pseudo-second order, Elovich, film diffusion, and intra-particle diffusion were evaluated using error functions in order to find the best fitted model. Comparing the obtained results revealed that PA is more effective in decolorization and has an uptake of about 90% in the optimum operating condition. For further investigation, its ashes have been used for MG removal, and as a result, 99.3% dye uptake by PA ash was obtained.

AB Aiming at the problem of insufficient knowledge service in the field of bridge inspection, this paper proposes a knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) model by using BERT and a novel hierarchical cross-attention mechanism. First, the BERT and static domain dictionaries are used as embedding layer for bridge inspection QA pairs to extract multi-granularity features. Second, in order to extract the topic entities from the domainspecific questions, the bidirectional long short-term memory model is employed to further extract features of the contextual dependency. Finally, the proposed hierarchical cross-attention mechanism realizes information interaction among the questions and knowledge triples, and calculates the similarity from shallow vocabulary and deep semantics. The proposed model is evaluated by using a general KGQA benchmark and a Chinese bridge inspection KGQA dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves outstanding performance on both datasets. In addition, a KGQA prototype system is employed as use case to illustrate the application effect in the practical scenario.

AB ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to verify the reliability and the concurrent and discriminant validity of the measurements of spasticity offered by the robotic device, quantifying the (1) test-retest reliability, (2) correlation with the clinical evaluation using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), (3) inter-rater reliability between the two physiotherapists, and (4) ability to discriminate between healthy and stroke patients. MethodsA total of 20 stroke patients and 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Two physical therapists (PT1 and PT2) independently evaluated the hand spasticity of stroke subjects using the MAS. Spasticity was assessed, both in healthy and stroke patients, with the Amadeo device at three increasing velocities of passive movement for three consecutive repeated assessments, while raw data of force and position were collected through an external program. Data analysisThe intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the weighted kappa were computed to estimate the reliability of the Amadeo device measurements, the inter-rater reliability of MAS, and the correlation between the MAS and Amadeo device measurements. The discriminant ability of the Amadeo device was assessed by comparing the stroke and healthy subjects' spasticity measurements with the percentage of agreements with 0 in MAS for healthy subjects. ResultsThe test-retest reliability of the Amadeo device was high with ICC at all three velocities (ICC = 0.908, 0.958, and 0.964, respectively) but lower if analyzed with weighted kappa correlation (0.584, 0.748, and 0.749, respectively) as mean values for each velocity. The correlation between Amadeo and the clinical scale for stroke patients with weighted kappa correlation was poor (0.280 & PLUSMN; 0.212 for PT1 and 0.290 & PLUSMN; 0.155 for PT2). The inter-rater reliability of the clinical MAS was high (ICC = 0.911). ConclusionBoth MAS and Amadeo spasticity scores showed good reliability. The Amadeo scores did not show a strong clinical correlation with the MAS in stroke patients. Hitherto, Amadeo evaluation shows trends that are consistent with the characteristics of spasticity, such as an increase in spasticity as the speed of muscle stretching increases. The ability of the device to discriminate between stroke patients and healthy controls is low. Future studies adopting an instrumental gold standard for spasticity may provide further insight into the validity of these measurements.

TI Estimating time series averages from latent space of multi-tasking

DE Latent space; Multi-tasking; Time series averaging
AB Time series averages are one key input to temporal data mining techniques such as classification, clustering, forecasting, etc. In practice, the optimality of estimated averages often impacts the performance of such temporal data mining techniques. Practically, an estimated average is presumed to be optimal if it minimizes the discrepancy between itself and members of an averaged set while preserving descriptive shapes. However, estimating an average under such constraints is often not trivial due to temporal shifts. To this end, all pioneering averaging techniques propose to align averaged series before estimating an average. Practically, the alignment gets performed to transform the averaged series, such that, after the transformation, they get registered to their arithmetic mean. However, in practice, most proposed alignment techniques often introduce additional challenges. For instance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based alignment techniques make the average estimation process non-smooth, non-convex, and computationally demanding. With such observation in mind, we approach time series averaging as a generative problem. Thus, we propose to mimic the effects of temporal alignment in the latent space of multi-tasking neural networks. We also propose to estimate (augment) time domain averages from the latent space representations. With this approach, we provide state-of-the-art latent space registration. Moreover, we provide time domain estimations that are better than the estimates generated by some pioneering averaging techniques.

AB IntroductionMaternal health is a critical aspect of public health that affects the wellbeing of both mothers and infants. Despite medical advancements, maternal mortality rates remain high, particularly in developing countries. AI-based models provide new ways to analyze and interpret medical data, which can ultimately improve maternal and fetal health outcomes. MethodsThis study proposes a deep hybrid model for maternal health risk classification in pregnancy, which utilizes the strengths of artificial neural networks (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms. The proposed model combines the two algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of risk classification in pregnant women. The dataset used in this study consists of features such as age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, and heart rate. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, with 75% of the data used for training and 25% used for testing. The output of the ANN and RF classifier is considered, and a maximum probability voting system selects the output with the highest probability as the most correct. ResultsPerformance is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Results showed that the proposed model achieves 95% accuracy, 97% precision, 97% recall, and an F1 score of 0.97 on the testing dataset. DiscussionThe deep hybrid model proposed in this study has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of maternal health risk classification in pregnancy, leading to better health outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. Future research could explore the generalizability of this model to other populations, incorporate unstructured medical data, and evaluate its feasibility for clinical use.

AB In recent times, video event detection gained high attention in the researcher's community, because of its widespread applications. In this paper, a new model is proposed for detecting different human actions in the video sequences. First, the videos are acquired from the University of Central Florida (UCF) 101, Human Motion Database (HMDB) 51 and Columbia Consumer Video (CCV) datasets. In addition, the DenseNet201 model is implemented for extracting deep feature values from the acquired datasets. Further, the Improved Gray Wolf Optimization (IGWO) algorithm is developed for selecting active/relevant feature values that effectively improve the computational time and system complexity. In the IGWO, leader enhancement and competitive strategies are employed to improve the convergence rate and to prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optima. Finally, the Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network is used for event classification (101 action types in UCF101, 51 action types in HMDB51, and 20 action types in CCV). In the resulting phase, the IGWO-based BiLSTM network achieved 94.73%, 96.53%, and 93.91% accuracy on the UCF101, HMDB51, and CCV datasets.

AB Public health initiatives must be made using evidence-based decision-making to have the greatest impact. Machine learning algorithms are created to gather, store, process, and analyze data to provide knowledge and guide decisions. A crucial part of any surveillance system is image analysis. The communities of computer vision and machine learning have become curious about it as of late. This study uses a variety of machine learning, and image processing approaches to detect and forecast malarial illness. In our research, we discovered the potential of deep learning techniques as innovative tools with a broader applicability for malaria detection, which benefits physicians by assisting in the diagnosis of the condition. We investigate the common confinements of deep learning for computer frameworks and organizing, including the requirement for data preparation, preparation overhead, real-time execution, and explaining ability, and uncover future inquiries about bearings focusing on these constraints.

AB Tree ensemble algorithms as RandomForest and GradientBoosting are currently the dominant methods for modeling discrete or tabular data, however, they are unable to perform a hierarchical representation learning from raw data as NeuralNetworks does thanks to its multi-layered structure, which is a key feature for DeepLearning problems and modeling unstructured data. This limitation is due to the fact that tree algorithms can not be trained with back-propagation because of their mathematical nature. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the mathematical formulation of bagging and boosting can be combined together to define a graph-structured-tree-ensemble algorithm with a distributed representation learning process between trees naturally (without using back-propagation). We call this novel approach Distributed Gradient Boosting Forest (DGBF) and we demonstrate that both RandomForest and GradientBoosting can be expressed as particular graph architectures of DGBT. Finally, we see that the distributed learning outperforms both RandomForest and GradientBoosting in 7 out of 9 datasets.

AB Spatial and temporal attention plays an important role in video classification tasks. However, there are few studies about the mechanism of spatial and temporal attention behind classification problems. Transformer owns excellent capabilities at training scalability and capturing long-range dependencies among sequences because of its self-attention mechanism, which has achieved great success in many fields, especially in video classifications. The spatio-temporal attention is separated into a temporal attention module and a spatial attention module through Divided-Space-Time Attention, which makes it more conveniently to configure the attention module and adjust the way of attention interaction. Then single-stream models and two-stream models are designed to study the laws of information interaction between spatial attention and temporal attention with a lot of carefully designed experiments. Experiments show that the spatial attention is more critical than the temporal attention, thus the balanced strategy that is commonly used is not always the best choice. Furthermore, there is a necessity to consider the classical two-stream structure models in some cases, which can get better results than the popular single-stream structure models.

DE Deep learning; Defect detection; Maximum mean discrepancy; Unsupervised
   partial domain adaptation
AB Recently, unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been increasingly applied to address the domain shift problems in defect detection. However, the effectiveness of most existing methods is based on the identical category space in the source and target domains. A more practical scenario is when the target domain only contains a subset of source categories, i.e., partial domain adaptation, which has not been well-resolved. To this end, a novel class-level weighted partial domain adaptation network (CWPDAN) is proposed for defect detection. Specifically, a hybrid weighting mechanism is derived from a defect classifier and an auxiliary domain classifier. In this case, the weighting mechanism is injected into both the defect classifier and the fine-grained domain adaptation strategy. As such, the shared category space across domains can be aligned well and the outlier categories can be identified and filtered out to alleviate negative transfer. Comprehensive partial domain adaptation experiments verify that the proposed CWPDAN can achieve 95.07% and 98.27% average accuracy on a tire defect dataset and a benchmark dataset, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

   recommendation
AB Session-based recommendation anticipates the next potential interest of users based on their previous anonymous interactions, which is a crucial and indispensable component of many online services. Recently, deep learning methods have attracted extensive attention for session-based recommendations due to their outstanding abilities in capturing user preferences. However, most existing methods fail to model the latent user intentions reflected by correlated items and ignore the noisy signals that exist in session sequences. To address these issues, we present a novel Intention-aware Denoising Graph Neural Network (ID-GNN) for session-based recommendation. Specifically, we propose an item graph construction module to explore the correlation of items in session sequences. Furthermore, we aggregate information on the constructed graph and employ an intention extraction matrix to capture the latent user intentions reflected by correlated items. Additionally, we introduce a relative sorting approach and a denoising threshold to adaptively filter out noisy user intentions. Experimental results on two e-commerce datasets demonstrate that ID-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB An improved grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is proposed in this paper, termed CMRWGOA, which combines both Random Weight (shorted RWGOA) and Cauchy mutation (termed CMGOA) mechanism into the GOA. The GOA received inspiration from the foraging and swarming habits of grasshoppers. The performance of the CMRWGOA was validated by 23 benchmark functions in comparison with four well-known meta-heuristic algorithms (AHA, DA, GOA, and MVO), CMGOA, RWGOA, and the GOA. The non-parametric Wilcoxon, Friedman, and Nemenyi statistical tests are conducted on the CMRWGOA. Furthermore, the CMRWGOA has been evaluated in three real-life challenging optimization problems as a complementary study. Various strictly extensive experimental results reveal that the CMRWGOA exhibit better performance.

AB Multi-objective problems are seen in most fields and represent challenges for researchers to solve them. Although a wide range of developed techniques has been provided to tackle these problems, the complexity of the proposed solutions requires the use of alternative algorithms. The innovation of this article is a multi-objective version of observer-teacher-learner-based optimization (OTLBO) called multi-objective observer-teacher-learner-based optimization (MOOTLBO), and an external archive has been employed to save the non-dominated Pareto-optimal solutions so far. This archive chooses the solutions using a leader selection strategy and a roulette wheel. Accordingly, a mutation operator was also added to the algorithm. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, nineteen standard test functions were used and compared via MOPSO, MOGWO and MOMPA algorithms. The Taguchi-grey relational method was employed to adjust the parameters of the investigated algorithms. The ability of the proposed algorithm was investigated by seven metrics. The results show that MOOTLBO outperforms the other algorithms in fourteen of the nineteen test problems and produces viable results.

AB In recent years, the problem of extensive energy consumption and carbon emission in manufacturing companies has been highlighted. Efficient scheduling strategies can help governments and production managers to control the raised environmental concerns resulting from this problem. The goal of this research is to address a green scheduling problem for unrelated parallel batch processes, as a group of highly energy-intensive machines, by considering the emission reduction regulation for the first time. To this aim, two new cases of unrelated parallel batch processing machine scheduling problems under the tax and cap-and-trade policies are defined. The problems are formulated using a mixed-integer linear mathematical model, where the goal is to minimize the makespan and total cost of the production system simultaneously. The total cost objective function includes the earliness and tardiness penalties, machine purchasing costs, and carbon emission costs. Also, several other features, such as setup time, release time, and the machines' purchasing decisions, are considered to provide a more realistic framework. As a solution approach, an interactive fuzzy programming method is presented to establish the single-objective counterpart of the models. Moreover, regarding the complexity of the problem, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and multiobjective gray wolf optimizer (MOGWO) algorithms are utilized as two multiobjective metaheuristics algorithms for large-size instances, for which the parameters are calibrated using the Taguchi design of experiments. Extensive analyses are established by solving several numerical instances. The outputs prove the superiority of the presented framework compared to the traditional models. The results also demonstrate that the newly developed cases can reduce the total cost of the production system by about 5.87 and 0.56% under the tax and cap-and-trade regulations, respectively. Besides, the statistical analysis of the results shows that NSGA-II outperforms the MOGWO algorithm for both cases.

AB The English translation platform based on Internet platform is gradually improving with the rapid development of computer Internet, cloud computing technology and search engine. However, in the traditional translation scenario, the corpus is difficult to reuse, and there are some problems, such as tight cycle, difficult manipulation of software, difficult internal and external cooperation and inconsistent translation style, which are often encountered by translators in the process of work. On this basis, the English translation system appears quietly, which can mainly help everyone improve the efficiency of translation and reduce the cost of translation. This paper focuses on how to add project team supervision to the collaborative translation software based on cloud translation platform, so as to make the relationship between different translators and translation corpus more coordinated, and build the relationship between translators and collaborative translation system by using assisted translation input method. This paper also gives the construction concept of intelligent data system and puts forward two functional modules: task management and resource supervision. In the task management section, a consistent control and supervision interface for crawler tasks is given, and the real-time adjustment function of crawler tasks can be used to supervise the progress of tasks at any time; in the resource monitoring module, it is mainly used to obtain the resource situation data of the crawler cluster in real time, and then dynamically adjust and monitor the crawler cluster with abnormal load according to the resource load evaluation based on the crawler cluster. Through the research on cloud computing and intelligent data system, this paper applies it to English cloud translation system, which greatly promotes the development of English translation.

AB In order to explore the predictive value of ultrasound measurement of the diameter of the optic nerve sheath for intracranial hypertension after craniotomy, 108 patients with intracranial pressure monitoring catheters with tip-integrated optical fiber pressure sensors were included in this article. The results showed that the ONSD in the severely elevated intracranial pressure group was significantly higher than that in the moderately elevated intracranial pressure group, the slightly elevated intracranial pressure group, and the normal intracranial pressure group (P < 0.05), using ONSD & GE; 4.7 mm to judge ICP elevation in the group with slight intracranial pressure increase is the best. At this time, the diagnostic sensitivity is 79%, and the specificity is 85%; in all cases included in the study, ONSD & GE; 5.01 mm was the best way to determine the effect of ICP elevation, with a sensitivity of 76.9%, a specificity of 88.1%, a positive predictive value of 86.5%, and a negative predictive value of 79.8%. It can be seen that ultrasound examination of the diameter of the optic nerve sheath can better reflect the increased level of ICP. As a noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring method, this method is a noninvasive, numerical reliable, simple, and easy to master technology, which is worthy of clinical application and promotion.

AB Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a systematic framework applied to recognize and eliminate viable failures within objects, services, structures, or designs at the early stage of the production process. The existing traditional FMEA approaches come with inherent deficiencies, e.g., all risk factors having similar weights, inappropriate and crisp risk priority numbers, and neglecting the existence of uncertainty and vagueness in experts' judgment. Our purpose is to identify the drawbacks of the existing models and then improve the risk assessment of failure modes under uncertain environments. For this purpose, we present a novel FMEA technique based on rough numbers and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) in multi-criteria decision-making problems. The presented FMEA model integrates the advantages of the PROMETHEE approach and the modified entropy weight method in coping with the roughness of linguistic assessment information. To illustrate its potential applications, the proposed method is tested to examine the risks of the general anesthesia process in the medical field. In the end, a comparison with the existing techniques is given to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model.

AB The field of computer architecture has long studied electricity consumption in depth. While energy acquisition as a machine learning metric is gaining traction, most experiments are still focused on achieving extremely high levels of accuracy with no computational constraints. This study discussed a novel technique for analysing power grid electricity consumption using a classification model and deep learning techniques. The dataset was collected and processed as part of a power grid-based electricity analysis. The processed data were then classified using a hierarchical combination model comprised of photovoltaic cell integrated spatio Gaussian markov convolutional neural networks. The experimental analysis included energy efficiency, power analysis, accuracy, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). After 10 epochs, deep learning also demonstrated competitive performance with accuracy in training and testing. Machine learning models could be useful in comparing firm energy usage and identifying areas for energy efficiency improvement. The proposed technique achieved 95% energy efficiency, 83% power analysis, 93% accuracy, 81% MAPE, 65% RMSE, and 93% specificity.

AB Trustworthy machine learning requires a high level of interpretability of machine learning models, yet many models are inherently black-boxes. Training interpretable models instead-or using them to mimic the black-box model-seems like a viable solution. In practice, however, these interpretable models are still unintelligible due to their size and complexity. In this paper, we present an approach to explain the logic of large interpretable models that can be represented as sets of logical rules by a simple, and thus intelligible, descriptive model. The coarseness of this descriptive model and its fidelity to the original model can be controlled, so that a user can understand the original model in varying levels of depth. We showcase and discuss this approach on three real-world problems from healthcare, material science, and finance.

AB Statistical data analysis and machine learning heavily rely on error measures for regression, classification, and forecasting. Bregman divergence (BD) is a widely used family of error measures, but it is not robust to outlying observations or high leverage points in large-and high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we propose a new family of robust Bregman divergences called "robust-BD" that are less sensitive to data outliers. We explore their suitability for sparse large-dimensional regression models with incompletely specified response variable distributions and propose a new estimate called the "penalized robust BD estimate" that achieves the same oracle property as ordinary non-robust penalized least squares and penalized-likelihood estimates. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed penalized robust-BD estimate and compare it with classical approaches, and show that our proposed method improves on existing approaches. Finally, we analyze a real dataset to illustrate the practicality of our proposed method. Our findings suggest that the proposed method can be a useful tool for robust statistical data analysis and machine learning in the presence of outliers and large-dimensional data.

AB Automatic Video captioning system is a method of describing the content in a video by analysing its visual aspects with regard to space and time and producing a meaningful caption that explains the video. A decade of research in this area has resulted in a steep growth in the quality and appropriateness of the generated caption compared with the expected result. The research has been driven from the very basic method to most advanced transformer method. Machine generated caption of a video must be adhering to many expected standards. For humans, this task may be a trivial one, however its not the same for a machine to analyse the content and generate a semantically coherent description for it. The caption which is generated in a natural language must also adhere to its lexical and syntactical structure. The video captioning process is a culmination of computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Commencing with template based conventional approach, it has surpassed statistical method, traditional deep learning approaches and is now in the trend of using transformers. This work made an extensive study of the literature and has proposed an improved transformer-based architecture for video captioning process. The transformer architecture made use of an encoder and decoder model that has two and three sublayers respectively. Multi-head self attention and cross attention are part of the model which bring about very beneficial results. The decoder is auto-regressive and uses a masked layer to prevent the model from foreseeing future words in the caption. An enhanced encoder-decoder Transformer model with CNN for feature extraction has been used in our work. This model captures the long-range dependencies and temporal relationships more effectively. The model has been evaluated with benchmark datasets and compared with state-of-the-art methods and found to be slightly better in the performance. The performance scores are slightly varying for BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE and CIDEr. Furthermore, we propose the idea of curriculum learning if incorporated can improve the results again.

DT Article; Early Access
DE computer vision; image processing; image segmentation; pose estimation
AB Human parsing is very important in a diverse range of industrial applications. Despite the considerable progress that has been achieved, the performance of existing methods is still less than satisfactory, since these methods learn the shared features of various parsing labels at the image level. This limits the representativeness of the learnt features, especially when the distribution of parsing labels is imbalanced or the scale of different labels is substantially different. To address this limitation, a Region-level Parsing Refiner (RPR) is proposed to enhance parsing performance by the introduction of region-level parsing learning. Region-level parsing focuses specifically on small regions of the body, for example, the head. The proposed RPR is an adaptive module that can be integrated with different existing human parsing models to improve their performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of our RPR model in terms of improving the overall parsing performance as well as parsing rare labels. This method was successfully applied to a commercial application for the extraction of human body measurements and has been used in various online shopping platforms for clothing size recommendations. The code and dataset are released at this link .

AB When a top-down method is taken to the task of human pose estimation, the accuracy of joint point localization is often limited by the accuracy of human detection. In addition, conventional algorithms commonly encode the image to generate a heat map before processing, but the systematic error in decoding the heat map back to the original image has an impact on the positioning. Therefore, to address the two problems, we propose an algorithm that uses multiple angle models to generate the human boxes and then performs lightweight decoding to recover the image. The new boxes can better fit humans and the recovery error can be reduced. First, we split the backbone network into three sub-networks, the first sub-network is responsible for generating the original human box, the second sub-network is responsible for generating a coarse pose estimation in the boxes, and the third sub-network is responsible for a high-precision pose estimation. In order to make the human box fit the human body better, with only a small number of interfering pixels inside the box, models of the human boxes with multiple rotation angles are generated. The results from the second sub-network are used to select the best human box. Using this human box as input to the third sub-network can significantly improve the accuracy of the pose estimation. Then to reduce the errors arising from image decoding, we propose a lightweight unbiased decoding strategy that differs from traditional methods by combining multiple possible offsets to select the direction and size of the final offset. On the MPII dataset and the COCO dataset, we compare the proposed algorithm with 11 state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the algorithm achieves a large improvement in accuracy for a wide range of image sizes and different metrics.

SO EVOLUTIONARY INTELLIGENCE

DE Kriging model; SAEAs; Sampling strategy; Expensive problems
ID EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHMS
AB Surrogate model assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) are strategies widely applied to deal with computationally expensive optimization problems (CEOPs). These methods employ metamodels to drive an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to promising design regions where new evaluations on the true-objective function must be performed. To do this, SAEAs are required to handle the challenge of training a metamodel to improve its predictions. The reliability of a metamodel is strongly related to the samples used for its training. Despite this, several SAEAs are proposed without concern about the sampling strategy employed. The ideal situation is to obtain a sample not far away from the solutions predicted on the metamodel. In this sense, the contribution/novelty of this paper regards an investigative study to compare five strategies for defining the metamodel sample in a proposed SAEA Framework (SAEA/F). The SAEA/F uses a one-dimensional Ordinary Kriging (OK) metamodel, and an expected improvement (EI) merit function is applied to define on which solutions to spend the budget of true-function evaluation. In this investigation, each strategy is incorporated into SAEA/F and then used to solve a set of analytical functions of single-objective optimization problems. The computational results suggest that two of the five sampling strategies stand out the best. The first strategy chooses those solutions with the lowest distance to the centroid of the population of solutions, and the second selects the newest solutions evaluated on true-objective function. The results highlight the potential of these approaches for solving expensive optimization problems since they speed up the algorithm convergence to improved solutions.

AB Recent studies have shown promising results on joint learning of local feature detectors and descriptors. To address the lack of ground-truth keypoint supervision, previous methods mainly inject appropriate knowledge about keypoint attributes into the network to facilitate model learning. In this paper, inspired by traditional corner detectors, we develop an end-to-end deep network, named Deep Corner, which adds a local similarity-based keypoint measure into a plain convolutional network. Deep Corner enables finding reliable keypoints and thus benefits the learning of the distinctive descriptors. Moreover, to improve keypoint localization, we first study previous multi-level keypoint detection strategies and then develop a multi-level U-Net architecture, where the similarity of features at multiple levels can be exploited effectively. Finally, to improve the invariance of descriptors, we propose a feature self-transformation operation, which transforms the learned features adaptively according to the specific local information. The experimental results on several tasks and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and the involved components.

DE Time series generation; Generative adversarial networks; Sparse
   self-attention
AB Remarkable progress has been achieved in generative modeling for time-series data, where the dominating models are generally generative adversarial networks (GANs) based on deep recurrent or convolutional neural networks. Most existing GANs for time-series generation focus on preserving correlations across time. Although these models may help in capturing long-term dependencies, their capacity to pay varying degrees of attention over different time steps is inadequate. In this paper, we propose SparseGAN, a novel sparse self-attention-based GANs that allows for attention-driven, long-memory modeling for regular and irregular time-series generation through learned embedding space. This way, it can yield a more informative representation for time-series generation while using original data for supervision. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model using synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental findings indicate that forecasting models trained on SparseGAN-generated data perform comparably to forecasting models trained on real data for both regularly and irregularly sampled time series. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our proposed generative model is superior to the current state-of-the-art models for data augmentation in the low-resource regime and introduces a novel method for generating realistic synthetic time-series data by leveraging long-term structural and temporal information.

DE COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mortality; Hospital acquired infection;

AB Our aim was to provide a comprehensive account of COVID-19 nosocomial infections (NIs) in England and identify their characteristics and outcomes using machine learning. From the Hospital Episodes Statistics database, 374,244 adult hospital patients in England with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged between March 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, were identified. A cohort of suspected COVID-19 NIs was identified using four empirical methods linked to hospital coding. A random forest classifier was designed to model the characteristics of these infections. The model estimated a mean NI rate of 10.5%, with a peak close to 18% during the first wave, but much lower rates (7%) thereafter. NIs were highly correlated with longer lengths of stay, high trust capacity strain, greater age and a higher degree of patient frailty, and associated with higher mortality rates and more severe COVID-19 sequelae, including pneumonia, kidney disease and sepsis. Identification of the characteristics of patients who acquire NIs should help trusts to identify those most at risk. The evolution of the NI rate over time may reflect the impact of changes in hospital management practises and vaccination efforts. Variations in NI rates across trusts may partly reflect different data recording and coding practise.

ID DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; SEVERITY
AB Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness for people suffering from diabetes. Microaneurysm (MA) is the initial symptom of DR. MA is a lesion based disease which starts as small red spots on the retina and increases in size as the DR progresses which finally leads to blindness. So eliminating the lesion can effectively prevent DR at an early stage. However, due to complex retinal structure, different brightness and contrast of fundus images with effects of factors such as different patients, environment changes, and difference in acquisition equipment, it is difficult for existing detection algorithms to achieve accurate results of MA detection and location. Therefore, the detection algorithm of improved YOLOv4 (YOLOv4-Pro) was proposed. First, an improved Fuzzy C-Means (IFCM) clustering algorithm was proposed to optimize anchor parameters of target samples to improve matching results between anchors and feature graphs. In order to control noise and improve efficiency, a median filtering method was employed to update the criterion function of the original FCM algorithm, and a K-means algorithm was employed to initialize clustering. Second, a SENet attention module was added in the backbone of YOLOv4 to enhance key information and suppress background, improving the confidence of MA effectively. Finally, the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) module was added to the neck to enhance the acceptance domain of the output characteristics of the backbone network, and profits separating of important context information. The improved YOLOv4 with IFCM was verified on the Kaggle DR dataset and compared with other methods. Experimental results show that optimizing the prior frame with the IFCM algorithm can make it suitable to frame the Kaggle DR dataset, which improves the detection accuracy of the network by nearly 5%, and provides a nice performance on detection and location of MA in fundus images. This would help ophthalmologists finding the exact location of MA on retina, thereby simplifying the process and eliminating any manual intervention.

AB Existing text-to-SQL semantic parsers are typically designed for particular settings such as handling queries that span multiple tables, domains, or turns which makes them ineffective when applied to different settings. We present UniSAr (Unified Structure-Aware Autoregressive Language Model), which benefits from directly using an off-the-shelf language model architecture and demonstrates consistently high performance under different settings. Specifically, UniSAr extends existing autoregressive language models to incorporate two non-invasive extensions to make them structure-aware: (1) adding structure mark to encode database schema, conversation context, and their relationships; (2) constrained decoding to decode well-structured SQL for a given database schema. On seven well-known text-to-SQL datasets covering multi-domain, multi-table, and multi-turn, UniSAr demonstrates highly comparable or better performance to the most advanced specifically-designed text-to-SQL models.

AB The success of deep neural networks has been impressive in many areas. However, the increase in model performance is usually accompanied by an increase in depth and width, which is not conducive to the model being deployed at the edge. To address this problem, a new inference framework, multi-scale adaptive networks (MSAN), is proposed. Specifically, several branches are added at different stages of the network, and a scalable attention as well as self-distillation are used to improve the performance of shallow branches. To enhance the distillation effect and to reuse features efficiently, the knowledge from shallow and deep layers is fused through selective feature connections. In addition, two adaptive distillation strategies are proposed to further improve the performance of self-distillation. MSAN can be used to promote the performance of networks, static model compression and dynamic inference. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superior performance of MSAN in these three aspects.

AB This paper investigates the event-based adaptive fixed-time (FT) control problem for active suspension systems (ASSs) with actuator faults. The fuzzy approximator is utilized to estimate the continuous function with the unknown car body mass parameters. The FT controller with continuous piecewise function is presented to avoid the singularity problem caused by the derivation of the virtual controller in the backstepping method and to compensate the actuator faults. A switching threshold event-triggered mechanism is evolved for ASSs, which has the advantages of fixed threshold strategy and relative threshold strategy to reduce the communication burden more reasonably. The suspension vertical displacement is restricted by constructing a time-varying barrier Lyapunov function. It is proved that the signals in the closed-loop systems are bounded by Lyapunov stability criterion. Finally, simulation results show that the controller is effective in suppressing the vertical vibration of ASSs.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Object detection; Class activation maps; Attention mechanism;

AB Class activation maps (CAMs) have been widely used on weakly-supervised object localization, which generate attention maps for specific categories in an image. Since CAMs can be obtained using category annotation, which is included in the annotation information of fully-supervised object detection. Therefore, how to adopt attention information in CAMs to improve the performance of fully-supervised object detection is an interesting problem. In this paper, we propose CAM R-CNN to deal with object detection, in which the category-aware attention maps provided by CAMs are integrated into the process of object detection. CAM R-CNN follows the common pipeline of the recent query-based object detectors in an end-to-end fashion, while two key CAM modules are embedded into the process. Specifically, E-CAM module provides embedding-level attention via fusing proposal features and attention information in CAMs with a transformer encoder, and S-CAM module supplies spatial-level attention by multiplying feature maps with the top-activated attention map provided by CAMs. In our experiments, CAM R-CNN demonstrates its superiority compared to several strong baselines on the challenging COCO dataset. Furthermore, we show that S-CAM module can be applied to two-stage detectors such as Faster R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN with consistent gains.

AB Big data analytics is important in many businesses that use computing applications like real-time shopping and e-commerce. Big data is employed for promoting goods and improve connectivity betwixt retailers and customers. People today frequently utilize online promotions to learn about the best stores to visit in order to purchase higher-quality goods. This purchasing experience along opinion regarding the shopper's shop can be observing through the customer-experience published across social media. A new customer requires information's about manufacturing date (MRD), manufacturing price (MRP), offers, quality, and suggestions while searching a shop that are presented by prior customer experience. The product cover or label already has MRP and MRD. The product details have been predicted using a variety of methods, however the information is not correct. To overcome these issues, Graph Sample and Aggregate Attention Network (GSAAN) Optimized with Barnacles Mating Algorithm (BMA) based Sentiment Analysis (SA) is proposed for Online Product Recommendation (GSAAN-BMA-SA-OPR). The data's are collected from the data set of Amazon Product recommendation. With the help of GSAAN with BMA classify product recommendation as excellent, good, very good, bad, very bad. The proposed model is implemented in MATLAB, its efficiency of the proposed system is examined under performance metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), accuracy, F-Score, recall, precision. The proposed technique attains higher MAPE 23.77%, 65.3% and 10.42% and lower MSE 42.15%, 29.64% and 32.48% comparing to the existing models. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Zeroing neural network (ZNN) is a powerful tool in designing suitable control schemes since it is a systematic approach. It has been used in fields like robot manipulator control and tracking control, but few researchers have investigated the possible application of the ZNN in multi-agent systems. Based on the elegant zeroing neural network (ZNN) scheme, in this paper, two novel noise-tolerant ZNN (NTZNN) models are proposed to achieve consensus, which is a crucial problem in the field of cooperative control of the multi-agent systems. Besides, the novel noise-tolerant sign-bi-power (NTSBP) and noise-tolerant sign-exp-power (NTSEP) activation functions are used in this study. The NTZNN models activated by NTSBP and NTSEP are more robust than traditional ZNN models activated by the traditional sign-bipower (SBP) and sign-exp-power (SEP) activation functions, respectively. The detailed mathematical analysis is presented to prove the robustness and predefined-time stability of the NTZNN models, and the upper bounds of the settling-time function are also estimated by a novel method based on improper integral. Combining the traditional Polyakov method and the proposed method based on improper integral, we can estimate the upper bounds of the settling-time function in a more precise way. Then, the robustness of the NTZNN models under both dynamic bounded vanishing noise and dynamic bounded non-vanishing noise is further evaluated by numerical experiments, and results show that the models are effective at both situations. We also present several practical examples of formation control, and parallel experiments are provided to further demonstrate that our results are general. All the theoretical and numerical verification results show that the NTZNN models are more robust than the traditional ZNN models activated by SBP or SEP activation functions, and it is also predefined-time stable.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Sugarcane is one of the main commodities in the world economy. An important step in the sugarcane supply chain is the harvest stage, requiring the support of mathematical modeling and optimization tools. Integrating the process of choosing the areas for harvesting according to the sugarcane maturation with the formation of the harvesting fronts and associating them with machine relocation costs is challenging. This paper contributes with a novel integer mathematical model that considers these concerns using three conflicting objectives. The first is that the sugarcane should be harvested as close as possible to its maturity, considering the sugarcane should be harvested as close as possible to its maturity by considering a combined measure of temperature and time since planting. The second aims to minimize the number of harvest fronts. The third objective is to minimize the costs involved with the relocation of the harvesters that cut the cane. Different strategies for obtaining Pareto-optimal solutions were proposed using exact methods, including MIP start and a decomposition technique. In the worst case, solutions with tolerable integrality gaps were obtained (inferior to 3%) in less than 1.5 h. Computational tests in real case studies were conducted in the sugarcane industry in two countries, indicating strong trade-offs in the determined solutions. In the Brazilian case, harvesting as close to maturation as possible, for example, causes an increase of 158% in the number of harvest fronts and 47% in the transportation costs, considering the minimum values for these objectives. Other trade-offs were seen and discussed when one of the other objectives was prioritized. These different compromise solutions help the decision-makers choose the most appropriate harvesting schedule according to their preferences.

AB Accurate makespan estimation is imperative during production scheduling to increase the flexibility and efficiency of work plans. However, given the complexities of production systems and product customizations, it is challenging to estimate makespans with high accuracy. In this paper, we propose a topic model-based neural network (TM-NN) method to increase the accuracy of makespan estimation for assembly processes. First, unlike traditional methods that use influential factors as inputs, we extract assembly features using a latent Dirichlet allocation model that mines latent topic information from an assembly instruction corpus. Then, the assembly process is represented as a sequence model with both assembly topics and features of the product physical characteristics, the assembly process, the equipment, the personnel, and uncertainty. Finally, we use a structured numerical vector as the input to machine learning-based predictive models, including a neural network, a random forest, and a support vector machine, and estimate makespans. The results show that the proposed TM-NN method effectively extracts latent topics in assembly documents and significantly increases the accuracy of makespan estimation. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI Map point selection for visual SLAM
SO ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Visual SLAM; Submodular maximisation; Subset selection
ID LOCALIZATION; RECOGNITION; SPACE
AB Simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) play a vital role in autonomous robotics. Robotic platforms are often resource-constrained, and this limitation motivates resource-efficient SLAM implementations. While sparse visual SLAM algorithms offer good accuracy for modest hardware requirements, even these more scalable sparse approaches face limitations when applied to largescale and long-term scenarios. A contributing factor is that the point clouds resulting from SLAM are inefficient to use and contain significant redundancy. This paper proposes the use of subset selection algorithms to reduce the map produced by sparse visual SLAM algorithms. Information-theoretic techniques have been applied to simpler related problems before, but they do not scale if applied to the full visual SLAM problem. This paper proposes a number of novel information-theoretic utility functions for map point selection and optimises these functions using greedy algorithms. The reduced maps are evaluated using practical data alongside an existing visual SLAM implementation (ORB-SLAM 2). Approximate selection techniques proposed in this paper achieve trajectory accuracy comparable to an offline baseline while being suitable for online use. These techniques enable the practical reduction of maps for visual SLAM with competitive trajectory accuracy. Results also demonstrate that SLAM front-end performance can significantly impact the performance of map point selection. This shows the importance of testing map point selection with a front-end implementation. To exploit this, this paper proposes an approach that includes a model of the front-end in the utility function when additional information is available. This approach outperforms alternatives on applicable datasets and highlights future research directions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart product-service system (smart PSS) has become the manufacturers' new revenue and sustainable competitiveness sources with the rise of digital servitization. To configure a customer-tailored smart PSS effectively, requirement analysis plays a significant role. Till now, the heterogeneity feature of smart PSS requirements, the usage of user-generated data, and data-driven paradigm have not been considered sufficiently. Hence, this study develops a UNISON framework based on the integration of deep learning approaches for eliciting and evaluating the user requirements for smart PSS with a systematic process, data-driven manner, and quantitative results. Adopting the user-centric perspective, this study employed massive user online reviews as the niche for requirement analysis. The bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network and biterm topic model (BTM) were employed to extract and elicit the smart PSS requirements in both product and service aspects. Further, a multi-dimensional and automatic requirement evaluation method integrating the sentiment analysis, IPA-Kano model, and opportunity algorithm was proposed for assessing, classifying, and prioritizing the identified requirement items. A smart PSS requirement landscape map was also developed to present the analysis results visually and guide decision-making. An empirical study has been conducted for the smart cleaning robot service system to prove the feasibility of the suggested approach. Enabled by the hybrid application of big data analytics and deep learning techniques, this study can empower the smart PSS provider to understand the user requirements comprehensively and upgrade the smart PSS design effectively.

AB Developing and applying new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in finance has become popular and one of the growing areas. Although many studies focus on return prediction and do not pay much attention to price formation, revealing its mechanism is essential in risk management, particularly in proactive risk management for investment to improve the performance. Thus, this paper introduces a novel multi-agent model, which is able to explain how agents' portfolio rebalances determine the market price dynamics to clarify the price formation by applying a state space model. The technical novelty is the effective integration of state space modeling and fuzzy logic into a multi agent model with four types of typical investors and their fuzzy trading strategies. By using the estimated unobservable fund flows of each trader in the model, this work proposes a new proactive warning signal. As a result, the signal improves both the risk and return of the investment in the Japanese and United States equity markets. Our findings indicate that the agents' estimated fund flows driving asset prices help us to avoid a market crash, reduce the risk and improve the return in investment practice.

AB As for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) powered by fuel cell, battery, and ultracapacitor, its complex topology structure and the variable terrain environment bring challenges to the energy management for power sources lifespan and fuel economy. In this paper, a terrain information-involved energy management strategy (EMS) obtained by an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to distribute reasonably the power demand for FCHEV. Specially, an action-value-based adaptive noise and an action screening-mechanism-based priority experience replay are designed for efficient strategy learning with the adopted algorithm. To protect fuel cell and battery from peak power, a hierarchical energy management framework is established by introducing an adaptive fuzzy filter. Then, an equivalent consumption minimization strategy based on multi-objective optimization is constructed and used as the reward of the improved algorithm to achieve the minimum fuel consumption. Meanwhile, based on historical experimental data, the terrain-information-considered transition probability matrix is obtained and applied to the algorithm to reduce computational load and get the optimal EMS. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EMS is verified by a series of comprehensive simulations under different driving cycles. The simulation results show that the hierarchical EMS framework can better protect the service life of fuel cell and battery. In addition, compared with the EMS without considering terrain information, the incorporation of terrain information in EMS can enhance the operational efficiency of fuel cell, improve fuel economy by about 8%, and can reach the dynamic programming benchmark level of 89.5%.

AB Proper equipment maintenance can significantly reduce overall operating costs by boosting productivity. Management personnel often consider maintenance an expense; however, a more positive approach is to view maintenance as a profit center. Considering this new perspective, the requirements for maintenance management have changed drastically from the traditional concept of fix-it-when-broken to a more complex approach that entails adopting a maintenance strategy for a more integrated approach and alignment. This paper presents a Goal Programming (GP) approach to define the most cost-effective method for maintaining some critical pumps in the paper industry. The failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) criteria consider each machine failure's occurrence, severity, and detection. After determining the weights, the optimal strategy for each failure is calculated by solving the goal programming. Thus, FMEA can be used to design a network structure for each pump failure mode. For this purpose, the limitations and goals affecting the model are obtained from research literature and interviews with experts. Regarding resource utilization and failure reduction, the results demonstrate that predictive and preventive maintenance strategies are superior to corrective strategies. Therefore, these strategies can predict failures, provide helpful information to maintenance managers, and limit the negative aspects of a failure regarding safety and cost.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT; VISION; VISIBILITY
AB Image dehazing is an important technique aimed at eliminating the haze in the atmosphere to enhance the image's visual quality. There are many applications where it has been used as a prepossessing step, such as in event detection. In recent years, the dark channel prior methodology has been recognised as an effective approach for eliminating haze from hazy images. However, the main drawback of the existing dark channel prior methodology is that it only considers a single colour channel of the RGB image with pixels having minimum intensity values. This non-uniform selection of the dark channel from a single channel eradicates the effect of the transmission across the different channels of the hazy image. Hence, the haze cannot be removed to a great extent using the existing method. Thus, to address the problem of non-uniform estimation of the dark channel by the existing dark channel prior method, we propose an approach where the dark channel will be computed from all three channels of an image by selecting the minimum intensity. The main advantage of using the proposed prior-based methodology for image dehazing over deep neural network-based models such as CNN or GANs is that training deep models requires a large amount of training data, thus resulting in a longer training time. Experimental outcomes exhibit that the proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets as well as real-world hazy images. The findings demonstrate that the proposed technique obtains better accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art methods and recent deep learning-based models over the D-HAZY, IHAZE, O-HAZE and Middlebury databases.

AB From machine learning recommendation to deep learning recommendation, reinforcement learning recommendation, and recommendation model compression, the network structure of the recommen-dation algorithm becomes more complex, more expressive, and more lightweight with higher real-time performance. However, most of these models are dedicated to recommendations by mining ratings and text information, and researchers have optimized the network structures of many recommendation models. However, mining image information and enriching recommendation model features are less studied, and there is still some room for optimization of deep recommendation model structures and real-time performance. To this end, this paper proposes a model called MMDIN by adding multi-head and multi-modal modules to the DIN model. The multi-modal module extracts image features, which enriches the feature set that the model can use and strengthens the cross-combination and fitting expression capabilities of the model. Meanwhile, the multi-head mechanism extracts features from different dimensions, which further enhances the model prediction performance. Experimental results show that the proposed MMDIN model improves the recommendation prediction performance, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in comprehensive indicators. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Ambiguity-selective consistency regularization for mean-teacher

SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS

DE Semi-supervised segmentation; Consistency regularization; Target
   selection
AB Semi-supervised learning has greatly advanced medical image segmentation since it effectively alleviates the need of acquiring abundant annotations from experts, wherein the mean-teacher model, known as a milestone of perturbed consistency learning, commonly serves as a standard and simple baseline. Inherently, learning from consistency can be regarded as learning from stability under perturbations. Recent improvement leans toward more complex consistency learning frameworks, yet, little attention is paid to the consistency target selection. Considering that the ambiguous regions from unlabeled data contain more informative complementary clues, in this paper, we improve the mean-teacher model to a novel ambiguity-consensus mean-teacher (AC-MT) model. Particularly, we comprehensively introduce and benchmark a family of plug and-play strategies for ambiguous target selection from the perspectives of entropy, model uncertainty and label noise self-identification, respectively. Then, the estimated ambiguity map is incorporated into the consistency loss to encourage consensus between the two models' predictions in these informative regions. In essence, our AC-MT aims to find out the most worthwhile voxel-wise targets from the unlabeled data, and the model especially learns from the perturbed stability of these informative regions. The proposed methods are extensively evaluated on left atrium segmentation and brain tumor segmentation. Encouragingly, our strategies bring substantial improvement over recent state-of-the-art methods. The ablation study further demonstrates our hypothesis and shows impressive results under various extreme annotation conditions.

ID NEURONS; ATTENTION; FEATURES
AB Detecting small moving targets consisting of one or few pixels is technically demanding due to their limited visual features. Motivated by nature, some bio-inspired models have been developed that simulate the behavior of small target motion detectors (STMDs), a class of specialized neurons found in insects' visual neural systems dominating in detecting small moving targets during activities such as predation or courtship. However, the existing models' high dependence on the sampling frequency of input videos becomes a bottleneck that seriously hinders their real-time applications in the physical world. This is because massive computational power is required to capture and process high-sampling-frequency videos. While model detection performance in low-sampling-frequency videos is plagued by significant spatial errors and weak responses. To address these issues, we propose an STMD-based visual neural model with a fractional-order difference operator for small target motion detection. The fractionalorder operator captures instantaneous luminance change and integrates it with memory information, where the instantaneous information dominates the integrated signal. The STMD network further separates the rising and falling luminance components, which are aligned in the time domain and then multiplied to predict the location of moving small targets. Due to the rapid response of instantaneous information and the supplement of memory information, the proposed model locates the small moving targets accurately and robustly in low-sampling-frequencies. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model significantly improves the detection performance for low-sampling-frequency videos.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI MDGAD: Meta domain generalization for distribution drift in anomaly

DE Anomaly detection; Distribution drift; Domain generalization; Meta
   learning
AB Anomalies often experience distribution drift over time in anomaly detection. Traditional anomaly detec-tion methods detect anomalies with the same distribution effectively, but it is difficult to detect anoma-lies with changing distributions. In this paper, we propose a meta domain generalization based anomaly detection (MDGAD) framework to detect anomalies when distribution drifts. The framework first divides the data into a series of subsets. We measure the domain shift between sets with a class-sensitive dis-tance metric, and merge similar sets, thereby generating different source domains to enhance domain diversity. We utilize the distribution shifts that existed on these source domains to simulate the distri-bution shifts that would be encountered when the model was applied. Meta learning is employed during training. First, the network is updated once on the meta-training set, and then another update is per-formed on the meta-verification set. These two gradients together determine the update direction of the network. At the same time, our framework will complete the domain alignment task on multiple source domains to extract domain invariant features and enhance the generalization of feature learning. We use Devnet as the base model and test our framework on 5 simulated data sets. The results confirm that our MDGAD outperforms current popular algorithms in detecting unknown anomalies and has better robustness. In addition, we also test our framework on real financial datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interactive fashion search is gaining more and more interest thanks to the rapid diffusion of online re-tailers. It allows users to browse fashion items and perform attribute manipulations, modifying parts or details of given garments. To successfully model and analyze garments at such a fine-grained level, it is necessary to obtain attribute-wise representations, separating information relative to different character-istics. In this work we propose an attribute disentanglement method based on attribute classifiers and the usage of gradient reversal layers. This combination allows us to learn attribute-specific features, re-moving unwanted details from each representation. We test the effectiveness of our learned features in a fashion attribute manipulation task, obtaining state of the art results. Furthermore, to favor training stability we present a novel loss balancing approach, preventing reversed losses to diverge during the optimization process. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB Learning domain-adaptive features is important to tackle the dataset bias problem, where data distributions in the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain can be different. The critical issue is to identify and then reduce the redundant information including class-irrelevant and domain-specific features. In this paper, a conditional independence induced unsupervised domain adaptation (CIDA) method is proposed to tackle the challenges. It aims to find the low-dimensional and transferable feature representation of each observation, namely the latent variable in the domain-adaptive subspace. Technically, two mutual information terms are optimized at the same time. One is the mutual information between the latent variable and the class label, and the other is the mutual information between the latent variable and the domain label. Note that the key module can be approximately reformulated as a conditional independence/dependence based optimization problem, and thus, it has a probabilistic interpretation with the Gaussian process. Temporary labels of the target samples and the model parameters are alternatively optimized. The objective function can be incorporated with deep network architectures, and the algorithm is implemented iteratively in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets, and the results show effectiveness of CIDA.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a system for autonomous cooperative wall building with a team of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The system was developed for Challenge 2 of the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2020. The wall-building scenario of Challenge 2 featured an initial stack of bricks and wall structure where the individual bricks had to be placed by a team of three UAVs. The objective of the task was to maximize collected points for placing the bricks within the restricted construction time while following the prescribed wall pattern. The proposed approach uses initial scanning to find a priori unknown locations of the bricks and the wall structure. Each UAV is then assigned to individual bricks and wall placing locations and further performs grasping and placement using onboard resources only. The developed system consists of methods for scanning a given area, RGB-D detection of bricks and wall placement locations, precise grasping and placing of bricks, and coordination of multiple UAVs. The paper describes the overall system, individual components, experimental verification in demanding outdoor conditions, the achieved results in the competition, and lessons learned. The presented CTU-UPenn-NYU approach achieved the overall best performance among all participants to win the MBZIRC competition by collecting the highest number of points by correct placement of a high number of bricks.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the development of the economy and technology, distributed manufacturing and green manufacturing are becoming more and more important parts of intelligent manufacturing. In this paper, an energy-efficient distributed assembly no-wait flow shop scheduling problem (EEDANWFSP) is proposed to minimize assembly completion time and total energy consumption. An improved iterative greedy (IIG) algorithm is proposed, which includes initialization, destruction, and construction, seven sequence-dependent and speed-dependent search strategies, and energy-saving operations. The initialization operation makes full use of the specific rules of the problem, constructs an initial job sequence for each product according to the principle of the shortest processing time, and then constructs the product sequence according to the assembly completion time of the product. Destruction and construction mechanisms generate a candidate individually. Seven search strategies operate on critical factories, randomly selecting possible locations where jobs or products are inserted or swapped into the rest of the sequence. Finally, an energy-saving strategy is used to optimize the energy consumption index. Experimental results on 900 small-scale and 810 large-scale benchmark tests demonstrate the effectiveness of IIG in addressing energy-efficient EEDANWFSP.

AB Supply lead time constitutes a core parameter in inventory management and plays a critical role in supply chain performance. Yet, how to promote better supply lead time estimations that account for multivariate effects of historical supplier dynamics remains poorly understood. This paper proposes a decision support system that uses a supervised regression strategy with multivariate information for estimating supply lead times. We combine ideas from big data analytics and data mining to explore the effects of different supply-related variables on the dynamics of supply lead time. We design a robust rolling window evaluation scheme to compare both the statistical and inventory performance of different well-known data mining models. Numerical tests with empirical data from a large automotive manufacturer demonstrate that the Random Forest model consistently outperforms other competing models, leading to median decreases of 18%-24% in the mean absolute errors of supply lead time estimations. As a consequence of our results, we also provide insights on how these estimations contribute to the proactive management of safety stocks.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Accurate and real-time grasping of household items is a challenge for home service robots in complex indoor environments. In this paper, using transparent cups as the recognition object, an accurate, reliable, and real-time visual algorithm is proposed for the elderly who needs nursing care to solve the recognition problems of overlapping, blurred, and small cups in complex unstructured indoor scenes. In order to meet the lightweight deployment of home service robots while considering both high-scale and low-scale semantic features, this paper designs a multi-scale fusion lightweight backbone network based on the Split Shuffle Block (SSB) and Group Shuffle Block (GSB) feature encoding units. Among them, depthwise separable convolution (DwConv) uses to reduce the amount of coding unit parameters, and feature shuffle uses to promote information exchange and the ability of information expression. In order to accurately identify the transparent cup camouflaged in complex backgrounds, this paper proposed a lightweight feature enhancement module that combines multi-scale hierarchical aggregation attention and multi-branch parallel convolution structure. The proposed module used an adaptive weighting strategy and a channel normalization weighting strategy to highlight the active regions of boundary features in each branch feature map, enhance the exchange of boundary information, and reduce the loss of detailed information. The experimental results on the IndoorCup and MobileCup datasets show that the detection accuracy of the proposed method is 93.6% and 92.6%, respectively, and the model calculation amount is only 0.91 M, which can lightweight deploy on indoor mobile robots for real-time detection. From the results of qualitative comparisons, the proposed method has strong robustness. It can effectively suppress false and missed detection caused by background interference. Likewise, it also effectively identifies camouflage objects and small objects in complex backgrounds.

AB Recent years' development of AI technology brings more convenience to our life while at the same time increasing the risk of personal information leakage. In this work, we try to protect personal information contained in the images by generating adversarial examples to fool the image captioning models. The generated adversarial examples are user-oriented which means the users can manipulate or hide sensitive information on the text output as they wish. By doing so, our personal information can be well protected from image captioning models. To fulfill the task, we adopt five kinds of adversarial attack.

AB The mixture of Gaussian processes is effective for regression, but it cannot handle the non-stationary curve clustering problem well. The two-layer mixture of Gaussian process functional regressions (TMGPFR) model was established to deal with this problem. In this paper, we first propose the classification EM (CEM) algorithm to solve that the optimization algorithm is inefficient for TMGPFRs, and then propose the deterministic annealing CEM algorithm for TMGPFRs to overcome the local maximum problem of the CEM algorithm. Lastly, experiments are conducted on synthetic and real-world data sets, and the results show that our proposed algorithms are more effective than the compared algorithms on curve clustering and regression.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In most binocular 3D detection algorithms, a large number of anchor points need to be selected, which leads to the problem of slow feature extraction. To solve this problem, an anchor-guided 3D object detection algorithm for autonomous driving is proposed based on Stereo Recurrent Convolutional Neutral Network (Stereo RCNN), which is called Fast Guided Anchored Stereo RCNN (FGAS RCNN). The proposed FGAS framework is divided into two stages. In the first stage, a probability map is generated for the left and right input images to determine the foreground position. Sparse anchor points and corresponding sparse anchor boxes are generated from the prior information. Left and right anchors are used as a whole to generate a 2D preselection box. In the second stage, a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) based on key point generation network is used to generate key points, which are combined with stereo regression to generate 3D preselected boxes. Finally, instance-level disparity estimation is proposed to solve the problem of pixel-level information loss in the original image. Instance-level disparity is combined with instance segmentation masks to improve the accuracy of center depth on the 3D bounding box. Extensive experiments on the challenging Kitti dataset and NuScences dataset show that the proposed method reduces the computational cost while maintaining a high regression rate without any depth information and prior information of position. Compared to other methods, the proposed method has higher efficiency, better robustness and stronger generalization ability.

AB Cutter suction dredgers (CSDs) play a very important role in the construction of ports, waterways and navigational channels. Currently, most of CSDs are mainly manipulated by human operators, and a large amount of instrument data needs to be monitored in real time in case of unforeseen accidents. In order to reduce the heavy workload of the operators, we propose a data-driven offline learning approach, named Preprocessing-Prediction-Learning Control (PPLC), for obtaining the optimal control policy of the excavating operation of CSDs. The proposed framework consists of three modules, i.e., a data preprocessing module, a dynamics prediction module realized by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a deep reinforcement learning based control module. The first module is responsible for filtering out irrelevant variables through correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction of raw data. The second module works as a state transition function that provides the dynamics prediction of the excavating operation of a CSD. To realize the learning control, the third module employs the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm to control the swing speed during the excavating operation. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can provide an effective and reliable solution to the automated excavating control of a CSD.

ID DISEASE; GEO
AB Lichen planus (LP) is an autoimmune disorder diagnosed based on physical symptoms and lab tests. Examples of symptoms include flat bumps, and itchy and purplish skin while lab tests include a shave biopsy of the lesion. When the pathology report shows consistency with LP and is negative for potential triggers for an allergy test and hepatitis C, a dermatologist typically prescribes corticosteroid in the form of pills or injection into the lesion to treat the symptoms. To understand the molecular mechanism of the disease and thereby overcome issues associated with disease treatment, there is a need to identify potential effective drugs, drug targets, and therapeutic targets associated the LP. Hence, we propose a novel computational framework based on new constrained optimization to support vector machines coupled with enrichment analysis. First, we downloaded three gene expression datasets (GSE63741, GSE193351, GSE52130) pertaining to healthy and LP patients from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. We then processed each dataset and entered it into our computational framework to select important genes. Finally, we performed enrichment analysis of selected genes, reporting the following results. Our methods outperformed baseline methods in terms of identifying disease and skin tissue. Moreover, we report 5 drugs (including, dexamethasone, retinoic acid, and quercetin), 45 unique genes (including PSMB8, KRT31, KRT16, KRT19, KRT17, COL3A1, LCE2D, LCE2A), and 23 unique TFs (including NFKB1, STAT1, STAT3), reportedly related to LP pathogenesis, treatments, and therapeutic targets. Our methods are publicly available in the GENEvaRX web server at https://aibio.shinyapps.io/GENEvaRX/.

AB The intended speech must be dealt with in the process of speech communication while under the impact of noise experienced in a variety of situations that degrade speech intelligibility and quality. This work proposes a multiple sub-frames analysis for the elimination of noise variants with compensation of the magnitude and phase spectrum from speech degraded by noise. The clean speech samples are extracted from the ITU-T recommended dataset at a 16 kHz sampling rate and down-sampled to an 8 kHz sampling rate. The noise signal variants are added from the AURORA and NOISEX-92 datasets at diverse input SNR levels (0 dB, 5 dB, 10 dB, 15 dB). The duration of window frames is chosen to be 25 msec in length, together with a shift percentage of 40%, to maintain the continuous nature of frames in speech. The smoothing factor for noise updating in a specific subframe is set to 9, and the spectral floor parameter for determining the precise amount of noise elimination in the corrupted spectrum is set to 0.03. The phase spectrum is compensated by incorporating a recompense function that is updated in combination with the sub-frame analysis. The accomplishment of the suggested approach is assessed with regard to objective metrics, including Segmental-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SegSNR), Mean-SquareError (MSE), and Perceptual-Evaluation-of-Speech-Quality (PESQ) scores corresponding to specific sub-frames of speech, respectively. To further analyze the improved quality, simple listening assessment and spectrogram analysis are incorporated, followed by a comparative investigation with prior noise-suppressive algorithms on the corrupted speech corpus.

AB In this article, we propose the concept of random polynomial neural networks (RPNNs) realized based on the architecture of polynomial neural networks (PNNs) with random polynomial neurons (RPNs). RPNs exhibit generalized polynomial neurons (PNs) based on random forest (RF) architecture. In the design of RPNs, the target variables are no longer directly used in conventional decision trees, and the polynomial of these target variables is exploited here to determine the average prediction. Unlike the conventional performance index used in the selection of PNs, the correlation coefficient is adopted here to select the RPNs of each layer. When compared with the conventional PNs used in PNNs, the proposed RPNs exhibit the following advantages: first, RPNs are insensitive to outliers; second, RPNs can obtain the importance of each input variable after training; third, RPNs can alleviate the overfitting problem with the use of an RF structure. The overall nonlinearity of a complex system is captured by means of PNNs. Moreover, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited to optimize the parameters when constructing RPNNs. The RPNNs take advantage of both RF and PNNs: it exhibits high accuracy based on ensemble learning used in the RF and is beneficial to describe high-order nonlinear relations between input and output variables stemming from PNNs. Experimental results based on a series of well-known modeling benchmarks illustrate that the proposed RPNNs outperform other state-of-the-art models reported in the literature.

DT Article

AB Text image captioning aims to understand the scene text in images for generating image captions. The key chal-lenge of this task is to accurately and comprehensively understand the OCR tokens of scene text. Due to the dual modal of visual and textual features of scene text, expressing the multimodal semantic features of OCR tokens ac-curately is a challenging task. Additionally, since scene text cannot exist independently of specific objects and is always associated with its surroundings, establishing a scene graph centered around OCR tokens is also an impor-tant approach to understand its relationship with other objects in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel model named Clip -OCR and Master ObjEct (dubbed as COME) for text image captioning. First, we introduce a CLIP-OCR module to enhance the multimodal representation of OCR tokens. We separate the OCR representation into visual and textual items and narrow the similarity by contrastive learning. With the assistance of the CLIP -OCR module, we realize correlation alignment between different modes. Next, we propose the concept of master object for each OCR text and purify the OCR-oriented scene graph with it. The master object is defined as the ob-ject to which the OCR is attached, which bridges the semantic relationship between the OCR tokens and the image. We consider the master object as a proxy that connects OCR tokens and other regions in the image. By ex-ploring the master object for each OCR token, we build a purified scene graph based on the master object and then enrich the visual embedding by the Graph Convolution Network (GCN). Furthermore, we cluster the OCR tokens and append the hierarchical information on the input embedding to provide a complete representation. Experiments on the TextCaps validation set and test set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Crowdsourcing learning; Three-way decision; Noise correction
ID MODEL QUALITY; IMPROVING DATA; TOOL
AB In crowdsourcing learning, a certain degree of label noise still exists in the integrated labels, which are obtained by label integration algorithms. In order to decrease the impact of label noise, many scholars focus on noise correction algorithms. Existing noise correction algorithms usually divide a data set with integrated labels into a clean set and a noise set, directly. However, there are certain noise instances in the clean set and clean instances in the noise set. To reduce the interference from noise instances and improve the utilization of clean instances, inspired by the three-way decision theory, we propose a three-way decision-based noise correction (TDNC) algorithm. Firstly, we calculate the compactness of each instance's multiple noisy label set and estimate the label certainty of each instance's integrated label. Secondly, we divide a data set with integrated labels into three disjoint sets, called positive set, boundary set and negative set, respectively. Thirdly, we further divide and add the instances in the boundary set into the positive set and the negative set according to the nearest neighbor classification. Finally, we train two heterogeneous classifiers on the new positive set to correct the noise instances in the new negative set using a consensus voting strategy. The experimental results on 34 simulated and two real-world data sets consistently show that TDNC significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art noise correction algorithms in terms of the noise ratio. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

DE Intelligent fault diagnosis; Universal domain adaptation; Label noise;
   Classifier gradient discrepancy
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation fuels knowledge transfer in fault diagnosis, but it depends entirely on a clean source domain and a common label set across domains. Nevertheless, due to the absent knowledge on the label set, the source domain may cover the utmost in classes and unknown classes also come in the target domain, making UDA utterly inapplicable and often impractical. Besides, the ubiquity of incorrect annotations is prone to occur in industrial dataset curations, but it is largely overlooked and left unsolved in UDA. To address these issues, towards a noisy and universal domain adaptation, a Meta Bi-classifier Gradient Discrepancy (MBGD) method is proposed. Specifically, a reliable dual-stage sample selection approach is first initiated to select clean and reusable source samples. Then, to handle private samples on both sides, a coupled divergence criterion is presented to separate target private samples, and a residual bi-classifier with learning constraints is constructed to weaken source private samples. Finally, with a bi-classifier gradient discrepancy, a meta-adversarial domain adaptation is proposed to empower a safe domain alignment on common samples. Comprehensive experiments on various noisy and universal tasks validate the efficacy of MBGD. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge graphs (KG) demonstrate superiority in storing and exploiting massive data and lesson-learned knowledge collected from equipment operation and maintenance management, and deliver a higher level of cognitive intelligence for fault diagnosis. However, for some indivisible multi-nary relations that connect more than two entities in complex fault diagnosis scenarios, ordinary KG has encountered many challenges in pre-serving their completeness and correctness with triples of < head entity, relation, tail entity >. To this end, this paper evolves the ordinary KG into Knowledge hypergraph (KHyG), based on the differentiation of schema-level and instance-level hyperedges. A pipeline for constructing KHyG using fault diagnosis reports is accordingly proposed, which adopts an end-to-end tabular information extraction manner and hyperedge-enabled schema. A two-channel KHyG embedding manner is then articulated for multi-nary relations, so as to strengthen the per-formance of troubleshooting solution generation in KHyG applications. To validate the proposed KHyG, real -world fault diagnosis was conducted on bridge cranes in steel factories, which demonstrated that the improvement in the modeling of multi-nary relations showed effectiveness and advances in fault investigation and troubleshooting process. It is anticipated that this study can provide several practical insights into applying more advanced KG models and techniques toward futuristic cognitive intelligence-enabled fault diagnosis.

AB Feature upsampling is a fundamental operation in modern deep network architectures. Existing upsamplers, however, are prone to cause negative upsampling-performance of an upsampler falls behind naive inter-polation. For instance, the recent dynamic upsampler CARAFE is the best performing operator in semantic segmentation, but it turns out to be the worst one in image matting. In this work, we present robuSt bIlatERal featuRe upsAmpler (SIERRA), a simple, task-robust, plug-and-play, and ultra lightweight upsampler. Its key idea is to use an efficient gradient-prior kernel to modulate a (shifted) distance-prior kernel to control which feature points participate in interpolation, which shares a similar spirit to joint bilateral filtering (JBF). Yet, in contrast to JBF that requires high-res guidance, SIERRA generates kernels from the low-res decoder feature alone. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and robustness of SIERRA on five dense prediction tasks. Code will be available online.

ID IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; NETWORK; MODEL; CNN
AB Fine-grained visual categorization, which aims to identify the different subcategories of images within the same category, is a very challenging task due to the large intra-class differences and subtle inter-class variances. The existing methods mostly focus on the salient local regions and ignore other features which probably help to recognize the images more precisely. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end network composed of the self-calibrated convolution, gradual attention module and feature inverse module for fine-grained visual categorization. To extract the salient features, the self-calibrated convolution is exploited which can avoid the influence of irrelevant information and locate salient regions more accurately. In aiming to extract the discriminative features, we propose the gradual attention module which consists of alternate channel-spatial attention and hierarchical feature grouping. The gradual attention module can extract the subtle discriminative features gradually even when the semantic information of shallow stages is not rich. Moreover, we design the feature inverse module which forces the next stage of network to search for other different useful features by feature inverse. The gradual attention module combined with the feature inverse module is capable of finding more detailed regions and of benefit to improving classification performance. Finally, the stage features and fused features are jointly used for classification. The proposed method is evaluated on three classical fine-grained image datasets and compared with a number of state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves 89.5%, 95.2% and 93.9% accuracies on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars and FGVC-Aircraft datasets respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

AB This paper describes a multi-layer approach to the problem of safe formation control. The agents' and the leader's dynamics are considered unknown Euler-Lagrange (E-L) systems. In addition, the environment is partially unknown. We propose a novel layered approach to reach the predefined target while preserving a designed, safe, optimal formation pattern along a planned optimal path. By satisfying the safety constraints, safe reinforcement learning (RL) is introduced to ensure the leader reaches the desired destination without collision. Maintaining a constant formation pattern is unsafe for followers since they are not familiar with the surroundings. Thus, we define the formation maneuver control problem, which can adjust formation geomatical patterns dynamically depending on the environment. A proposed algorithm based on the leader's designed path is defined to solve the problem. Using off-policy RL, the model-free distributed control law is presented to generate a designed formation pattern in a determined optimal path. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can be applied to the safe formation maneuver problem in an environment with convex obstacles. This paper presents a safe formation control strategy that addresses practical issues, such as model uncertainty, without requiring sensor measurements in an unknown, static environment without uncertainty. Simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the suggested approaches for a group of Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs). & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Point cloud upsampling is a basic low-level task, that is important for improving the quality of a point cloud. However, existing point cloud upsampling methods perform poorly on sparse and non-uniform point clouds, due to that they fail to fully model the relationship between points. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an attention-guided network called APUNet to exploit the correlation between points, which can perform unsampling for sparse and non-uniform point cloud. In particular, we first propose a feature extraction unit, DisTransformer, which can effectively model the relationship between points by introducing a distance prior to the attention mechanism. We also design a point cloud fea-ture extraction network based on DisTransformer. By computing the correlation between patches and the correlation between points, we fuse the global and local features to better model the correlation of the whole object. Furthermore, we propose a feature prediction module based on attention mechanisms that avoids generating clustered points by transforming the point cloud expansion task into a point cloud pre-diction task. Qualitative and quantitative experiments reveal the superiority of our method compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Compared with other point cloud upsampling methods, APUNet can much better upsample non-uniform and extremely sparse point clouds. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Low-dose CT techniques attempt to minimize the radiation exposure of patients by estimating the high -resolution normal-dose CT images to reduce the risk of radiation-induced cancer. In recent years, many deep learning methods have been proposed to solve this problem by building a mapping function between low-dose CT images and their high-dose counterparts. However, most of these methods ignore the effect of different radiation doses on the final CT images, which results in large differences in the intensity of the noise observable in CT images. What'more, the noise intensity of low-dose CT images exists significantly differences under different medical devices manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a multi-level noise -aware network (MLNAN) implemented with constrained cycle Wasserstein generative adversarial networks to recovery the low-dose CT images under uncertain noise levels. Particularly, the noise-level classification is predicted and reused as a prior pattern in generator networks. Moreover, the discriminator network introduces noise-level determination. Under two dose-reduction strategies, experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed method are conducted on two datasets, including the simulated clinical AAPM challenge datasets and commercial CT datasets from United Imaging Healthcare (UIH). The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in terms of noise suppression and structural detail preservation compared with several other deep-learning based methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the individual components regarding the afforded performance improvement. Further research for practical clinical applications and other medical modalities is required in future works.

AB The potential of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to online real-time monitor the ?-polyglutamic acid (?-PGA) fermentation process by measuring the concentration of two key components, glucose and sodium glutamate, was investigated. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were selected as the multivariate calibration model to predict fermentation parameters. To solve the small sample training problem with CNN, the data augmentation strategy was firstly combined with a shallow CNN to generate a new CNN model termed as DA-CNN. To improve the performance of DA-CNN further, squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module of the attention mechanism was integrated into DA-CNN to form a DA-CNN variant termed as DA-SE-CNN, which could capture the different importance of extracted channel-wise feature to improve feature representation ability. Experiments were conducted on the ?-PGA dataset, and the results showed that the nonlinear models (CNN, DA-CNN and DA-SE-CNN) performed better than the linear method (PLSR) in all cases except the case of sodium glutamate prediction with CNN. Addi-tionally, both DA-CNN and DA-SE-CNN perform better than CNN in all cases with limited training data. Espe-cially DA-SE-CNN gave the best result with excellent prediction accuracy, which indicated that ATR-FTIR combined with nonlinear regression tool (DA-SE-CNN) as a rapid method to monitor ?-PGA fermentation process is feasible.

AB The indeterminacy of financial markets leads investors to face different types of security returns. Usually, security returns are assumed to be random variables when sufficient transaction data are available. If data are missing, they can be regarded as uncertain variables. However, uncertainty and randomness coexist. In this situation, chance theory is the main tool to deal with this complex phenomenon. This paper investigates the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of uncertain random variables and its application to portfolio selection. First, we define the CVaR of uncertain random variables and discuss some of its mathematical properties. Then, we propose an uncertain random simulation to approximate the CVaR. Next, we define the inverse function of the CVaR of uncertain random variables, as well as a computational procedure. As an application in finance, we establish uncertain random mean-CVaR portfolio selection models. We also perform a numerical example to illustrate the applicability of the proposed models. Finally, we numerically compare the mean-CVaR models with the mean-variance models with respect to the optimal investment strategy.

AB Cloud-based solutions for software development activities have been emerging in the last decade. This study aims to develop a hybrid technology adoption model for cloud use in software development activities. It is based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, and the proposed extension Personal-Organization-Project (POP) structure. The methodology selected is a questionnaire-based survey and data are collected through personally administered questionnaire sessions with developers and managers, resulting in 268 responses regarding 84 software development projects from 30 organizations in Turkey, selected by considering company and project sizes and geographical proximity to allow face-to-face response collection. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used for statistical evaluation and hypothesis testing. The final model was reached upon modifications and it was found to explain the intention to adopt and use the cloud for software development meaningfully. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify and understand factors that affect the intention of developing software on the cloud. The developed hybrid model was validated to be used in further technology adoption studies. Upon modifying the conceptual model and discovering new relations, a novel model is proposed to draw the relationships between the identified factors and the actual use, intention to use and perceived suitability. Practical and social implications are drawn from the results to help organizations and individuals make decisions on cloud adoption for software development.

AB The stope dynamic disaster, which occurs around the mining space and is represented by stress-type rock burst and fracture-type rock burst, seriously affects the safety production of coal mine. How to effectively forewarn rock burst risk to reduce the disaster caused by rock burst is an urgent problem to be solved in stope. In this paper, the spatiotemporal parameters that affect the occurrence of stope dynamic disaster are collected, and the big data of stope state is established. Due to the complex temporal and spatial parameters of rock bursts with different intensities occurrence and their varying degrees, it is difficult for some machine learning methods to excavate their internal relationships and make accurate warning. In this paper, (1) a big data platform is used to record and integrate the multiple parameters of stope dynamic disaster, and data preprocessing technology is used to de-noise and standardize them. (2) Based on the fused historical data, a strong classifier is iteratively found by the classification algorithm AdaBoost to identify the existence of the rock burst risk, so as to achieve the purpose of accurately and timely warning of rock burst risk. The research of this paper uses big data mining technology and machine learning method to carry out intelligent perception warning of the rock burst risk in real time.

AB Improving last mile delivery, in terms of both efficiency and sustainability, has recently been enhanced using truck/drone tandems. However, nearly all these approaches focus only on deliveries, while returns are ignored. We propose a new model for integrating both delivery and returns in the combined operation of a truck and a drone, which we term the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem integrating Deliveries and Returns with Multiple Payloads (FSTSP-DR-MP). This approach is more sustainable than truck-only deliveries as the drones operate through battery power with no emissions and can move more directly than vehicles along a road network. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program to minimize the total service time of the system, where the truck and the drone can perform both delivery and pickup of parcels during a single sortie. Because drones have a capacity of multiple parcels, each can visit more than one customer per dispatch, increasing drone utilization and responsiveness to customer expectations regarding return services, along with greater environmental improvements. Small-size cases are solved exactly using the MILP implemented in the CPLEX Python API. Since the MILP is not practical for realistically sized cases, we propose a meta-heuristic derived from Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS), which iteratively builds truck and drone routes. We show that this works well for up to 100 customers, a typical number in last-mile logistics. We assess the trade-offs between the ratio of returns to deliveries and drone capacity to provide managerial insights to the benefits of this approach for sustainable last mile logistics. Computational experiments show that integrating delivery and return truck-drone operations significantly reduces total service time and truck travel time compared to both traditional delivery schemes (single truck) and the well-known FSTSP drone schemes (one truck and one drone) up to 36.2% and 22.9%, respectively, by exploiting the nature of each customer (delivery or return) to increase the number of stops of each drone sortie. We also conduct a comparison with multiple drones have a single payload under similar scenarios. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms this alternative with an average improvement of 3.9% in total service time. Our approach addresses an important gap in the literature by accommodating returns, which are ubiquitous in last mile logistics, as well as providing for improved drone utilization, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness.

AB Moving object segmentation in real-world scenes is of critical significance for many computer vision applications. However, there are many challenges in moving object segmentation. It is difficult to distinguish objects with motion degeneracy. Besides, complex scenes and noisy 2D optical flows also effect the result of moving object segmentation. In this paper, to address difficulties caused by motion degeneracy, we analyze the classic motion degeneracy from a new geometric perspective. To identify objects with motion degeneracy, we propose a reprojection cost and an optical flow contrast cost which are fed into the network to enrich motion features. Furthermore, a novel geometric constraint called bidirectional motion constraint is proposed to detect moving objects with weak motion features. In order to tackle more complex scenes, we also introduce a motion aware architecture to predict instance masks of moving objects. Extensive experiments are conducted on the KITTI dataset, the JNU-UISEE dataset and the KittiMoSeg dataset, and our proposed method achieves excellent performance.

AB IntroductionThe Cancer Field Effect describes an area of pre-cancerous cells that results from continued exposure to carcinogens. Cells in the cancer field can easily develop into cancer. Removal of the main tumor mass might leave the cancer field behind, increasing risk of recurrence. MethodsThe model we propose for the cancer field effect is a hybrid cellular automaton (CA), which includes a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to compute the effects of the carcinogens on the gene expression of the genes related to cancer development. We use carcinogen interactions that are typically associated with smoking and alcohol consumption and their effect on cancer fields of the tongue. ResultsUsing simulations we support the understanding that tobacco smoking is a potent carcinogen, which can be reinforced by alcohol consumption. The effect of alcohol alone is significantly less than the effect of tobacco. We further observe that pairing tumor excision with field removal delays recurrence compared to tumor excision alone. We track cell lineages and find that, in most cases, a polyclonal field develops, where the number of distinct cell lineages decreases over time as some lineages become dominant over others. Finally, we find tumor masses rarely form via monoclonal origin.

AB Accurate traffic forecasting plays a critical role in the construction of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the across road-network isomorphism in the spatial dimension and the periodic drift in the temporal dimension, existing traffic forecasting methods cannot satisfy the intricate spatial-temporal characteristics well. In this article, a spatial-temporal hypergraph convolutional network for traffic forecasting (ST-HCN) is proposed to tackle the problems mentioned above. Specifically, the proposed framework applies the K-means clustering algorithm and the connection characteristics of the physical road network itself to unify the local correlation and across road-network isomorphism. Then, a dual-channel hypergraph convolution to capture high-order spatial relationships in traffic data is established. Furthermore, the proposed framework utilizes a long short-term memory network with a convolution module (ConvLSTM) to deal with the periodic drift problem. Finally, the experiments in the real world demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB The focus of this work is on the application of classical Model Order Reduction techniques, such as Active Subspaces and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, to Deep Neural Networks. We propose a generic methodology to reduce the number of layers in a pre-trained network by combining the aforementioned techniques for dimensionality reduction with input-output mappings, such as Polynomial Chaos Expansion and Feedforward Neural Networks. The motivation behind compressing the architecture of an existing Convolutional Neural Network arises from its usage in embedded systems with specific storage constraints. The conducted numerical tests demonstrate that the resulting reduced networks can achieve a level of accuracy comparable to the original Convolutional Neural Network being examined, while also saving memory allocation. Our primary emphasis lies in the field of image recognition, where we tested our methodology using VGG-16 and ResNet-110 architectures against three different datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and a custom dataset.

DE Federated learning; Personalized; Attention; Inconsistency
AB Federated learning (FL) is an effective way to incorporate information provided by different clients when a single local client is unable to provide sufficient training samples for establishing a satisfactory deep learning model to diagnose rolling bearing faults, which plays an important role in ensuring the safe operations of motors. However, it is difficult to guarantee the effectiveness of FL when clients operating in different working conditions suffer from network attacks. This paper aims to study a new personalized FL (PFL) mechanism to secure each client's maximum benefit from the federation process such that the negative effects of condition variations or network attacks can be effectively prevented. By designing the inconsistency between the local model and the inherited global model, the information screening process in PFL is guided to ensure that each local client receives the maximum benefit. The model inconsistency derived from a certain round of federation is characterized by the output of an attention mechanism. Since personalized client information is emphasized, the proposed method can build reliable FL fault diagnosis models from unreliable samples in cases with attacked client-side sample data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by using the benchmark dataset provided by the Rolling Bearing Center of Case Western Reserve University. In the case when a certain client suffers from a strong network attack, the proposed method can achieve a fault diagnosis accuracy improvement of 27.11% over the existing FL fault diagnosis methods.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) refers to the implementation of a damage detection strategy for structures. Fault occurrence in these structural systems during the operation is inevitable. Efficient, fast, and precise health monitoring methods are required to proactively perform the necessary repairs and maintenance on time before it is too late. The current structural health monitoring methods involve physically attached sensors or non-contact vision-based vibration measurements. However, these methods have significant drawbacks due to the low spatial resolution, weight influence on the lightweight structure, and time/labor consumption. Recently, computer-vison-based deep learning methods like convolutional neural network (CNN) and fully convolutional neural network (FCN) have been applied for defect detection and localization, which address the aforementioned problems and obtain high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture comprising CNN and temporal convolutional networks (CNN-TCN) for the computer vision-based defect detection task. Various beam samples, consisting of five different materials and various structural defects, were used to evaluate the proposed deep learning algorithms' performance. The proposed deep learning methods treat each pixel of the video frame like a sensor to extract valuable features for defect detection. Through empirical results, we demonstrate that this 'pixel-sensor' approach is more efficient and accurate and can achieve a better defect detection performance on different beam samples compared with the current state-of-the-art approaches, including CNN-long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN-bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), multi-scale CNN-LSTM, and CNN-gated recurrent unit(GRU) methods.

AB In this paper, a novel image encryption algorithm (DMHM-IEA) based on a two-dimensional discrete memristive hyperchaotic map (2D-DMHM) derived from discrete memristor and improved Logistic map is proposed. The thorough performance investigation demonstrates that adding the memristor enhances the complicated dynamic characteristics and sequence unpredictability of the proposed map, making it more appropriate for usage in image encryption applications. Diffusion-permutation-diffusion is an inventive structure that DMHM-IEA uses to provide great encryption effect with just one round of encryption. In the random position permutation, pixel positions are quickly and arbitrarily changed to new positions, while the diffusion process uses main-diagonal diffusion and counter-diagonal diffusion to spread out the minor changes in the original image throughout the entire plane, resulting in a highly distinct encrypted image. The combined performance and security evaluation demonstrates that DMHM-IEA has strong tolerance to noise and data loss as well as good resistance to potential attacks. When compared to other cutting-edge algorithms, the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of security.

AB Closed Captioning (CC) is a telecommunications service to display textual information equivalent to audio. Although the primary consumer group is Deaf (D) and Hard of Hearing (HOH) viewers, they are typically excluded from the quality assessment process. Including D and HOH viewers for all assessments is nearly impossible and requires enormous effort. One solution is to use machine learning algorithms to replicate human subjective evaluation of the quality of CC. In this paper, a multi-label classifier was trained using an active learning algorithm with D and HOH viewers, predicting human subjective ratings on the various quality of CC. An online user study was conducted to train the multilayer perception with D and HoH participant subjective quality assessment rating data on machine-queried CC encoded to short video clips in various genres. The result revealed the possibilities of using an automated assessment system to predict the human perceived quality of CC, human preferences and perceiving behaviour upon viewing CC with deliberate error inclusion.

TI TIAR: Text-Image-Audio Retrieval with weighted multimodal re-ranking
SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Cross-modal retrieval; Audio retrieval; Multimedia; Fusion learning
AB Cross-modal retrieval has developed remarkably recently and received extensive attention as an essential method for multimodal interaction study. However, most existing models are limited to one of the applications in cross-modal retrieval, i.e., text-image retrieval, and neglect the audio modality, which is widely distributed in data and can be integrated into the models to improve retrieval performance. To address this issue, we propose a text-image-audio cross-modal retrieval (TIAR) model that, given any or two modalities, implements the retrieval of the remaining modalities. TIAR consists of three modal-specific encoders to extract the features and a cross-modal encoder to generate joint contextualized representations for all modalities. To evaluate our model, we present two new cross-modal retrieval tasks, named cross-unimodal and cross-bimodal retrieval, that are applicable to three modalities. Then, during testing, we propose a weighted multimodal re-ranking (WMR) algorithm which integrates comprehensive ranking information in the similarity matrices of all tasks to improve the performance without additional training. The experiment results show that TIAR-WMR outperforms state-of-the-art models in traditional text-image retrieval on Flickr30k, COCO, and ADE20k datasets. Moreover, the retrieval performance of TIAR-WMR is further boosted in the two proposed tasks when two input modalities are integrated. The code is available at .https://github.com/PeideChi/TIAR.

ID SENSOR; MODEL; RECONSTRUCTION; ROBUST
AB Complete data on wastewater quality are essential for managing and monitoring wastewater treatment processes. Most management and monitoring methods involve the use of voluminous training data for imputation, but the problem is that the sensors used in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) collect only a limited amount of data. The lack of sufficient training data can diminish the accuracy of traditional imputation techniques. To address this problem, this study developed a novel approach called Miss-GBRT (imputing missing values with gradient boosting regression trees), which can impute missing values into wastewater quality data even with minimal training data. The proposed approach consists of a preprocessing stage and an imputation stage. In the preprocessing stage, different copies of masked datasets are produced from raw data according to various levels of missingness, after which pre-imputation is conducted to ensure the integrality of training data. In the imputation stage, Miss-GBRT is used to combine shallow regression trees to regress the residuals of time and impute each missing value into a masked dataset in a stepwise manner. We carried out extensive experiments on the WWTP datasets of the University of California, Irvine and Beijing Drainage Group to compare Miss-GBRT with baseline imputation methods. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach improves the accuracy with which missing wastewater quality data are imputed under limited training data. It can also perform better than other methods on datasets with considerable proportions of missing values.

AB Microstrip filters are widely used in signal processing because of their light weight, compact structure and high reliability. Designing these filters is very time consuming, and a designer generally needs much knowledge of electromagnetic theory. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been used to accelerate the design process. However, current AI models retain the human design mindset (adopt a regular structure) and thus cannot be applied to the automatic design of irregular structures. We proposed a clustering-reinforcement learning model named parallel advantage actor-critic with K-means (PAAC-K). The PAAC-K model is based on a reinforcement learning model, in which the size of the overlapping area is used as the reward function, and a clustering algorithm was added to extract characteristics for learning. We used the stepwise training method to avoid repeated exploration in a design with different frequencies. The PAAC-K model realized superhuman intelligence that automated the design of irregular structures, which was proven with four application examples. This work presents an AI model and a design mindset for irregular structures, which is of great significance in promoting the development of filter devices.

AB The anonymity and high security of the Tor network allow it to host a significant amount of criminal activities. Some Tor domains attract more traffic than others, as they offer better products or services to their customers. Detecting the most influential domains in Tor can help detect serious criminal activities. Therefore, in this paper, we present a novel supervised ranking framework for detecting the most influential domains. Our approach represents each domain with 40 features extracted from five sources: text, named entities, HTML markup, network topology, and visual content to train the learning-to-rank (LtR) scheme to sort the domains based on user-defined criteria. We experimented on a subset of 290 manually ranked drug-related websites from Tor and obtained the following results. First, among the explored LtR schemes, the listwise approach outperforms the benchmarked methods with an NDCG of 0.93 for the top-10 ranked domains. Second, we quantitatively proved that our framework surpasses the link-based ranking techniques. Third, we observed that using the user-visible text feature can obtain comparable performance to all the features with a decrease of 0.02 at NDCG@5. The proposed framework might support law enforcement agencies in detecting the most influential domains related to possible suspicious activities.

ID IMAGES; GAN
AB Building change detection (CD) is an important remote sensing technology with abundant application scenarios. However, the sparsity of building samples in a dataset and ambiguity of labels caused by manual annotations greatly affect the advancement of deep learning (DL) in the field of CD. In this article, we address these problems using two strategies: model optimization and dataset augmentation. On the one hand, we propose a Siamese full-scale connected network based on a feature difference augmentation module (FAM), namely, SFNet. SFNet utilizes full-scale skip connections and deep supervision combined with multiscale feature information to fully capture the features of sparse buildings. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid loss function to alleviate the negative effects of sparse samples and ambiguous labels and use an automatic weight module (AWM) to automatically adjust their weights. On the other hand, we select suitable locations on the original dataset images and blend the virtual buildings harmoniously through the proposed hybrid image blending module (IBM), which further alleviates the sample sparsity problem. Experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU-CD datasets show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the impacts of sample sparsity and label inaccuracies and outperform several other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

AB In this research, we proposed a stereo visual simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) system that efficiently works in agricultural scenarios without compromising the performance and accuracy in contrast to the other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed system is equipped with an image enhancement technique for the ORB point and LSD line features recovery, which enables it to work in broader scenarios and gives extensive spatial information from the low-light and hazy agricultural environment. Firstly, the method has been tested on the standard dataset, i.e., KITTI and EuRoC, to validate the localisation accuracy by comparing it with the other state-of-the-art methods, namely VINS-SLAM, PL-SLAM, and ORB-SLAM2. The experimental results evidence that the proposed method obtains superior localisation and mapping accuracy than the other visual SLAM methods. Secondly, the proposed method is tested on the ROSARIO dataset, our low-light agricultural dataset, and O-HAZE dataset to validate the performance in agricultural environments. In such cases, while other methods fail to operate in such complex agricultural environments, our method successfully operates with high localisation and mapping accuracy.

AB We present a terrain traversability mapping and navigation system (TNS) for autonomous excavator applications in an unstructured environment. We use an efficient approach to extract terrain features from RGB images and 3D point clouds and incorporate them into a global map for planning and navigation. Our system can adapt to changing environments and update the terrain information in real-time. Moreover, we present a novel dataset, the Complex Worksite Terrain dataset, which consists of RGB images from construction sites with seven categories based on navigability. Our novel algorithms improve the mapping accuracy over previous methods by 4.17-30.48% and reduce MSE on the traversability map by 13.8-71.4%. We have combined our mapping approach with planning and control modules in an autonomous excavator navigation system and observe 49.3% improvement in the overall success rate. Based on TNS, we demonstrate the first autonomous excavator that can navigate through unstructured environments consisting of deep pits, steep hills, rock piles, and other complex terrain features. In addition, we combine the proposed TNS with the autonomous excavation system (AES), and deploy the new pipeline, TNES, on a more complex construction site. With minimum human intervention, we demonstrate autonomous navigation capability with excavation tasks.

ID DATASET
AB Real-world grasp detection is challenging due to the stochasticity in grasp dynamics and the noise in hardware. Ideally, the system would adapt to the real world by training directly on physical systems. However, this is generally difficult due to the large amount of training data required by most grasp learning models. In this paper, we note that the planar grasp function is SE(2)-equivariant and demonstrate that this structure can be used to constrain the neural network used during learning. This creates an inductive bias that can significantly improve the sample efficiency of grasp learning and enable end-to-end training from scratch on a physical robot with as few as 600 grasp attempts. We call this method Symmetric Grasp learning (SymGrasp) and show that it can learn to grasp "from scratch" in less that 1.5 h of physical robot time. This paper represents an expanded and revised version of the conference paper Zhu et al. (2022).

TI Unsupervised Feature Selection via Controllable Adaptive Graph Learning

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Adaptive graph; feature learning; unsupervised feature selection
AB Unsupervised feature selection is challenging in machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. The crucial difficulty is to learn a moderate subspace that preserves the intrinsic structure and to find uncorrelated or independent features simultaneously. The most common solution is first to project the original data into a lower dimensional space and then force them to preserve the similar intrinsic structure under linear uncorrelation constraint. However, there are three shortcomings. First, the final graph generated by the iterative learning process differs significantly from the initial graph in which the original intrinsic structure is embedded. Second, it requires prior knowledge about a moderate dimension of subspace. Third, it is inefficient when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. The first shortcoming, which is longstanding and undiscovered, makes the previous methods fail to achieve their expected results. The last two ones increase the difficulty of applying in different fields. Therefore, two unsupervised feature selection methods are proposed based on controllable adaptive graph learning and uncorrelated/independent feature learning (CAG-U and CAG-I) to address the abovementioned issues. In the proposed methods, the final graph that preserves intrinsic structure can be adaptively learned while the difference between the two graphs can be well controlled. Besides, relatively uncorrelated/independent features can be selected using a discrete projection matrix. The experimental results on 12 datasets in different fields show the superiority of CAG-U and CAG-I.

AB In the recent improvement in deep learning approaches for realistic image generation and translation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) delivered favorable results. GAN generates novel samples that look indistinguishable from authentic images. This paper proposes a novel generative network for thermal-to-visible image translation. Thermal to Visible synthesis is challenging due to the non-availability of accurate semantic and textural information in thermal images. The thermal sensors acquire the thermal face images by capturing the object's luminance with fewer details about the actual facial information. However, it is advantageous for low-light and night-time vision, where image information cannot be captured in a complex environment by an RGB camera. We design a new Attention-guided Cyclic Generative Adversarial Network for Thermal to Visible Face transformation (TVA-GAN) by integrating a new attention network. We utilize attention guidance with a recurrent block with an Inception module to simplify the learning space toward the optimum solution. The proposed TVA-GAN is trained and evaluated for thermal to visible face synthesis over three benchmark datasets, including the WHU-IIP, Tufts Face Thermal2RGB, and CVBL-CHILD datasets. The proposed TVA-GAN results show promising improvement in face synthesis compared to the state-of-the-art GAN methods. For the proposed TVA-GAN, code is available at: .

TI Deep Convolutional Tables: Deep Learning Without Convolutions
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Convolutional tables (CTs); deep learning; efficient computation
AB We propose a novel formulation of deep networks that do not use dot-product neurons and rely on a hierarchy of voting tables instead, denoted as convolutional tables (CTs), to enable accelerated CPU-based inference. Convolutional layers are the most time-consuming bottleneck in contemporary deep learning techniques, severely limiting their use in the Internet of Things and CPU-based devices. The proposed CT performs a fern operation at each image location: it encodes the location environment into a binary index and uses the index to retrieve the desired local output from a table. The results of multiple tables are combined to derive the final output. The computational complexity of a CT transformation is independent of the patch (filter) size and grows gracefully with the number of channels, outperforming comparable convolutional layers. It is shown to have a better capacity:compute ratio than dot-product neurons, and that deep CT networks exhibit a universal approximation property similar to neural networks. As the transformation involves computing discrete indices, we derive a soft relaxation and gradient-based approach for training the CT hierarchy. Deep CT networks have been experimentally shown to have accuracy comparable to that of CNNs of similar architectures. In the low-compute regime, they enable an error:speed tradeoff superior to alternative efficient CNN architectures.

AB The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global public health crisis, which caused millions of deaths and billions of infections, greatly increasing the pressure on medical resources. With the continuous emergence of viral mutations, developing automated tools for COVID-19 diagnosis is highly desired to assist the clinical diagnosis and reduce the tedious workload of image interpretation. However, medical images in a single site are usually of a limited amount or weakly labeled, while integrating data scattered around different institutions to build effective models is not allowed due to data policy restrictions. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving cross-site framework for COVID-19 diagnosis with multimodal data, seeking to effectively leverage heterogeneous data from multiple parties while preserving patients' privacy. Specifically, a Siamese branched network is introduced as the backbone to capture inherent relationships across heterogeneous samples. The redesigned network is capable of handling semisupervised inputs in multimodalities and conducting task-specific training, in order to improve the model performance of various scenarios. The framework achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods, as we demonstrate through extensive simulations on real-world datasets.

AB Exploring the mechanism of hysteresis dynamics may facilitate the analysis and controller design to alleviate detrimental effects. Conventional models, such as the Bouc-Wen and Preisach models consist of complicated nonlinear structures, limiting the applications of hysteresis systems for high-speed and high-precision positioning, detection, execution, and other operations. In this article, a Bayesian Koopman (B-Koopman) learning algorithm is therefore developed to characterize hysteresis dynamics. Essentially, the proposed scheme establishes a simplified linear representation with time delay for hysteresis dynamics, where the properties of the original nonlinear system are preserved. Furthermore, model parameters are optimized via sparse Bayesian learning together with an iterative strategy, which simplifies the identification procedure and reduces modeling errors. Extensive experimental results on piezoelectric positioning are elaborated to substantiate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed B-Koopman algorithm for learning hysteresis dynamics.

AB This article is concerned with the synchronization issue of discrete Markov jump neural networks (MJNNs). First, to save communication resources, a universal communication model, including event-triggered transmission, logarithmic quantization, and asynchronous phenomenon, is proposed, which is close to the actual situation. Here, to further reduce conservatism, a more general event-triggered protocol is constructed by developing the threshold parameter as a diagonal matrix. To cope with mode mismatch between the nodes and controllers due to potentially occurring time lag and packet dropouts, a hidden Markov model (HMM) method is adopted. Second, considering that state information of nodes may not be available, the asynchronous output feedback controllers are devised by a novel decoupling strategy. Then, sufficient conditions based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) for dissipative synchronization of MJNNs are proposed with the virtue of Lyapunov techniques. Third, by eliminating asynchronous terms, a corollary with less computational cost is devised. Finally, two numerical examples verify the effectiveness of the above results.

ID PREDICTION
AB Multimodal metric learning aims to transform heterogeneous data into a common subspace where cross-modal similarity computing can be directly performed and has received much attention in recent years. Typically, the existing methods are designed for nonhierarchical labeled data. Such methods fail to exploit the intercategory correlations in the label hierarchy and, therefore, cannot achieve optimal performance on hierarchical labeled data. To address this problem, we propose a novel metric learning method for hierarchical labeled multimodal data, named deep hierarchical multimodal metric learning (DHMML). It learns the multilayer representations for each modality by establishing a layer-specific network corresponding to each layer in the label hierarchy. In particular, a multilayer classification mechanism is introduced to enable the layerwise representations to not only preserve the semantic similarities within each layer, but also retain the intercategory correlations across different layers. In addition, an adversarial learning mechanism is proposed to bridge the cross-modality gap by producing indistinguishable features for different modalities. Through integration of the multilayer classification and adversarial learning mechanisms, DHMML can obtain hierarchical discriminative modality-invariant representations for multimodal data. Experiments on two benchmark datasets are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DHMML method over several state-of-the-art methods.

AB To pursue comprehensive performance, recent text detectors improve detection speed at the expense of accuracy. They adopt shrink-mask-based text representation strategies, which leads to a high dependence of detection accuracy on shrink-masks. Unfortunately, three disadvantages cause unreliable shrink-masks. Specifically, these methods try to strengthen the discrimination of shrink-masks from the background by semantic information. However, the feature defocusing phenomenon that coarse layers are optimized by fine-grained objectives limits the extraction of semantic features. Meanwhile, since both shrink-masks and the margins belong to texts, the detail loss phenomenon that the margins are ignored hinders the distinguishment of shrink-masks from the margins, which causes ambiguous shrink-mask edges. Moreover, false-positive samples enjoy similar visual features with shrink-masks. They aggravate the decline of shrink-masks recognition. To avoid the above problems, we propose a zoom text detector (ZTD) inspired by the zoom process of the camera. Specifically, zoomed-out view module (ZOM) is introduced to provide coarse-grained optimization objectives for coarse layers to avoid feature defocusing. Meanwhile, zoomed-in view module (ZIM) is presented to enhance the margins recognition to prevent detail loss. Furthermore, sequential-visual discriminator (SVD) is designed to suppress false-positive samples by sequential and visual features. Experiments verify the superior comprehensive performance of ZTD.

ID PERSON REIDENTIFICATION
AB Reidentification (Re-id) of vehicles in a multicamera system is an essential process for traffic control automation. Previously, there have been efforts to reidentify vehicles based on shots of images with identity (id) labels, where the model training relies on the quality and quantity of the labels. However, labeling vehicle ids is a labor-intensive procedure. Instead of relying on expensive labels, we propose to exploit camera and tracklet ids that are automatically obtainable during a Re-id dataset construction. In this article, we present weakly supervised contrastive learning (WSCL) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques using camera and tracklet ids for unsupervised vehicle Re-id. We define each camera id as a subdomain and tracklet id as a label of a vehicle within each subdomain, i.e., weak label in the Re-id scenario. Within each subdomain, contrastive learning using tracklet ids is applied to learn a representation of vehicles. Then, DA is performed to match vehicle ids across the subdomains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for unsupervised vehicle Re-id using various benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art unsupervised Re-id methods. The source code is publicly available on https://github.com/andreYoo/WSCL_VeReid.

AB Although learning-based light field disparity estimation has achieved great progress in the most recent years, the performance of unsupervised light field learning is still hindered by occlusions and noises. By analyzing the overall strategy underlying the unsupervised methodology and the light field geometry implied in epipolar plane images (EPIs), we look beyond the photometric consistency assumption, and design an occlusion-aware unsupervised framework to deal with the situations of photometric consistency conflict. Specifically, we present a geometry-based light field occlusion modeling, which predicts a group of visibility masks and occlusion maps, respectively, by forward warping and backward EPI-line tracing. In order to learn better the noise-and occlusion-invariant representations of the light field, we propose two occlusion-aware unsupervised losses: occlusion-aware SSIM and statistics-based EPI loss. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can improve the estimation accuracy of light field depth over the occluded and noisy regions, and preserve the occlusion boundaries better.

Novel stability conditions are derived by employing free-matrix-based inequality and introducing the variable-augmented-based free-weighting matrices in the estimation of the derivative of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs). Both techniques avoid the appearance of the nonlinear terms of the time-varying delay. Especially, the time-varying free-weighting matrices associated with the derivative of the delay and the time-varying S-Procedure related to the delay and its derivative are combined to improve the presented criteria. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the benefits of the presented methods.

AB This article investigates constrained online noncooperative games (NGs) of multiagent systems over unbalanced digraphs, where the cost functions of players are time-varying and are gradually revealed to corresponding players only after decisions are made. Moreover, in the problem, the players are subject to local convex set constraints and time-varying coupling nonlinear inequality constraints. To the best of our knowledge, no result about online games with unbalanced digraphs has been reported, let alone constrained online games. To seek the variational generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the game online, a distributed learning algorithm is proposed based on gradient descent, projection, and primal-dual methods. Under the algorithm, sublinear dynamic regrets and constraint violations are established. Finally, online electricity market games illustrate the algorithm.

TI DiamondNet: A Neural-Network-Based Heterogeneous Sensor Attentive Fusion

AB With the proliferation of intelligent sensors integrated into mobile devices, fine-grained human activity recognition (HAR) based on lightweight sensors has emerged as a useful tool for personalized applications. Although shallow and deep learning algorithms have been proposed for HAR problems in the past decades, these methods have limited capability to exploit semantic features from multiple sensor types. To address this limitation, we propose a novel HAR framework, DiamondNet, which can create heterogeneous multisensor modalities, denoise, extract, and fuse features from a fresh perspective. In DiamondNet, we leverage multiple 1-D convolutional denoising autoencoders (1-D-CDAEs) to extract robust encoder features. We further introduce an attention-based graph convolutional network to construct new heterogeneous multisensor modalities, which adaptively exploit the potential relationship between different sensors. Moreover, the proposed attentive fusion subnet, which jointly employs a global-attention mechanism and shallow features, effectively calibrates different-level features of multiple sensor modalities. This approach amplifies informative features and provides a comprehensive and robust perception for HAR. The efficacy of the DiamondNet framework is validated on three public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DiamondNet outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines, achieving remarkable and consistent accuracy improvements. Overall, our work introduces a new perspective on HAR, leveraging the power of multiple sensor modalities and attention mechanisms to significantly improve the performance.

AB Financial risks are among the most important risks in the construction industry projects, which significantly impact project objectives, including project cost. Besides, financial risks have many interactions with each other and project parameters, which must be taken into account to analyze risks correctly. In addition, a source of financial risks in a project is the contract, which is the most important project document. Identifying terms related to financial risks in a contract and considering their effects on the risk management process is an essential issue that has been neglected. Hence, an integrated model for evaluating financial risks and their related contractual clauses were presented. To this end, the effect of financial risks on the project cost was simulated using a system dynamics model. Moreover, terms related to financial risks in a contract text were identified and extracted using text mining, and their effect was included in the system dynamics model. The model was implemented in a hospital construction project in Tehran as a case study, and its results were analyzed. The innovation of the research is integrating text mining and the system dynamics model to investigate the effect of financial risks and related contractual clauses on the project cost.

AB The general mitigating and aggravating circumstances of criminal liability are elements attached to the crime that, when they occur, affect the punishment quantum. Cuban criminal legislation provides a catalog of such circumstances and some general conditions for their application. Such norms give judges broad discretion in assessing circumstances and adjusting punishment based on the intensity of those circumstances. In the interest of broad judicial discretion, the law does not establish specific ways for measuring circumstances' intensity. This gives judges more freedom and autonomy, but it also imposes on them more social responsibility and challenges them to manage the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in this complex activity. This paper proposes a model to aid the linguistic assessment of circumstances' intensity and to provide linguistic and numerical recommendations to determine an appropriate punishment interval. M-LAMAC determines the collective evaluation of circumstances of the same type, determines the prevalence of a type of circumstance by means of a compensation function, recommends the required modification in the input interval, and finally recommends a numerical interval adjusted to the judges' initially expressed preferences. The model's applicability is demonstrated by means of several experiments on a fictitious case of bank document forgery.

AB This article addresses the exponential input-to-state stabilization problem for switched reaction-diffusion systems, in which the systems' mode jumping complies with the persistent dwell-time switching mechanism. On the basis of point measurement, a novel pointwise controller is designed to reduce the amount of sensors and actuators. Then, a hysteresis quantizer with an adjustable parameter is employed to balance the quantitative effect and system's performance, which can improve the bandwidth utilization of the network, simultaneously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by an application of the temperature control of power semiconductor chips.

AB Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have become an increasingly important part of artificial intelligence, and KGs have been widely used in artificial intelligence fields such as intelligent answering questions and personalized recommendation. Previous knowledge graph completion methods require a large number of samples for each relation. But in fact, in KGs, many relationships are long-tail relationships, and the existing researches on few-shot completion mainly focus on static knowledge graphs. In this paper, we consider few-shot completion in Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) where the event may only hold for a specific timestamp, and propose a model abbreviated as FTMO based on meta-optimization. In this model, we combine the time-based relational-aware heterogeneous neighbor encoder, the cyclic automatic aggregation network, and the matching network to complete the few-shot temporal knowledge graph. We compare our model with the baseline models, and the experimental results demostrate the performance advantages of our model.

AB The Oven Scheduling Problem (OSP) is a new parallel batch scheduling problem that arises in the area of electronic component manufacturing. Jobs need to be scheduled to one of several ovens and may be processed simultaneously in one batch if they have compatible requirements. The scheduling of jobs must respect several constraints concerning eligibility and availability of ovens, release dates of jobs, setup times between batches as well as oven capacities. Running the ovens is highly energy-intensive and thus the main objective, besides finishing jobs on time, is to minimize the cumulative batch processing time across all ovens. This objective distinguishes the OSP from other batch processing problems which typically minimize objectives related to makespan, tardiness or lateness. We propose to solve this NP-hard scheduling problem using exact techniques and present two different modelling approaches, one based on batch positions and another on representative jobs for batches. These models are formulated as constraint programming (CP) and integer linear programming (ILP) models and implemented both in the solver-independent modeling language MiniZinc and using interval variables in CP Optimizer. An extensive experimental evaluation of our solution methods is performed on a diverse set of problem instances. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art solvers on the different models and on three variants of the objective function that reflect different real-life scenarios. We show that our models can find feasible solutions for instances of realistic size, many of those being provably optimal or nearly optimal solutions.

AB IoT-based Intelligent transport system(ITS) is an innovative solution to urban traffic problems by providing different modes of traffic, traffic management and enabling the user to be informed and safe. ITS throughput is highly dependent on the effectiveness of short-term traffic flow prediction (STTP). To overcome this challenge, we propose the Adaptive grid search-based particle swarm optimization (GPSO) Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model with spatial-temporal correlated raster data to predict short-term traffic flow. Initially, we explore non-euclidean space, uncertainty, and the nonlinearity of traffic flow. After that, we optimize hyperparameters of the LSTM according to real-time traffic flow data by Adaptive GPSO and incorporate spatial-temporal correlation value with LSTM to STTP. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model by doing a thorough experiment on two real-world data sets. To inspect the scalability of the proposed approach, we demonstrate it in different traffic conditions and for different congestion parameters. Simultaneously, we compare the performance of Adaptive GPSO-LSTM with existing state-of-art algorithms.

AB By absorbing the merits of both the model- and data-driven methods, deep physics-engaged learning scheme achieves high-accuracy and interpretable image reconstruction. It has attracted growing attention and become the mainstream for inverse imaging tasks. Focusing on the image compressed sensing (CS) problem, we find the intrinsic defect of this emerging paradigm, widely implemented by deep algorithm-unrolled networks, in which more plain iterations involving real physics will bring enormous computation cost and long inference time, hindering their practical application. A novel deep Physics-guided unRolled recovery Learning (RL) framework is proposed by generalizing the traditional iterative recovery model from image domain (ID) to the high-dimensional feature domain (FD). A compact multiscale unrolling architecture is then developed to enhance the network capacity and keep real-time inference speeds. Taking two different perspectives of optimization and range-nullspace decomposition, instead of building an algorithm-specific unrolled network, we provide two implementations: PRL-PGD and PRL-RND. Experiments exhibit the significant performance and efficiency leading of PRL networks over other state-of-the-art methods with a large potential for further improvement and real application to other inverse imaging problems or optimization models.

TI Improving Domain Adaptation Through Class Aware Frequency Transformation
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DE Unsupervised domain adaptation; Frequency transformation; Pseudo label;
   Gaussian mixture model
AB In this work, we explore the usage of the frequency transformation for reducing the domain shift between the source and target domain (e.g., synthetic image and real image respectively) towards solving the domain adaptation task. Most of the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms focus on reducing the global domain shift between labelled source and unlabelled target domains by matching the marginal distributions under a small domain gap assumption. UDA performance degrades for the cases where the domain gap between source and target distribution is large. In order to bring the source and the target domains closer, we propose a novel approach based on traditional image processing technique Class Aware Frequency Transformation (CAFT) that utilizes pseudo label based class consistent low-frequency swapping for improving the overall performance of the existing UDA algorithms. The proposed approach, when compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning based methods, is computationally more efficient and can easily be plugged into any existing UDA algorithm to improve its performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach based on absolute difference of top-2 class prediction probabilities for filtering target pseudo labels into clean and noisy sets. Samples with clean pseudo labels can be used to improve the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms. We name the overall framework as CAFT++. We evaluate the same on the top of different UDA algorithms across many public domain adaptation datasets. Our extensive experiments indicate that CAFT++ is able to achieve significant performance gains across all the popular benchmarks.

AB Sleep quality assessment as an indicator of daily health care plays an important role in our physiological and mental activity. Sound during sleep contains rich information on biological activities, such as body movement, snoring, and sleep bruxism. However, sound features differ depending on individual and environmental differences. In order to develop a wide-rage applicable daily sleep assessment, this paper utilizes deep learning to ease individual and environmental differences of sound features. Firstly, by Variational Domain Adversarial Neural Network (VDANN) encodes sound events into latent representation, simultaneously eliminates subject-dependent features. Then, sleep pattern in the obtained latent space is trained by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with associated sleep assessment of one night. We performed age group estimation from normal sleep as an objective indicator of sleep comparing to their age group. The experiment with more than 100 subjects showed that VDANN is able to extract subject independent features, and the proposed method outperforms the conventional method for age group estimation from sleep sound even for new subjects. In addition, our model is able to personalize by controlling subject-dependent embedding when after data accumulation of the subject.

AB The autism dataset is studied to identify the differences between autistic and healthy groups. For this, the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of the two groups are analyzed, and networks of connections between brain regions were created. Several classification frameworks are developed to distinguish the connectivity patterns between the groups. The best models for statistical inference and precision were compared, and the tradeoff between precision and model interpretability was analyzed. Finally, the classification accuracy measures were reported to justify the performance of our framework. Our best model based on features obtained from single brain atlas can classify autistic and healthy patients on the multisite ABIDE I data with 71% accuracy.

AB Hospitals' Emergency Departments (ED) have a great relevance in the health of the population. Properly managing the ED department requires to optimise the service, while maintaining a high quality care. This trade-off implies to properly arrange the schedule for the personnel, so the service can duly attend all patients. In this regard, a key point is to know in advance how many patients will arrive to the service and the number that should be derived to hospitalisation. To provide such information, we present the results of applying different algorithms for forecasting ED admissions and hospitalisations for both seven days and four months ahead. To do this, we have employed the ED admissions and inpatients series from a Spanish civil and military hospital. The ED admissions have been aggregated on a daily basis and on the official workers' shifts, while the hospitalisations series have been considered daily. Over that data we employ two algorithms types: time series (AR, H-W, SARIMA and Prophet) and feature matrix (LR, EN, XGBoost and GLM). In addition, we create all possible ensembles among the models in order to find the best forecasting method. The findings of our study demonstrate that the ensembles can be beneficial in obtaining the best possible model.

AB This publication presents a solution approach to oncological aftercare for cancer patients by means of artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This approach shall support patients in overcoming the after-effects of therapy effectively with suitable supportive actions and health-care professionals in goal-oriented planning of these actions. Different AI methods are used for analyzing patients' needs for supportive actions depending on the available health data and for a monitoring of these actions. Decision support methods are used for effective planning of actions based on the AI results of analysis. The solution approach is realized in the form of a web application for health-care professionals, which allows for data analysis and planning of actions, and a mobile application for patients, which facilitates documentation and monitoring of supportive actions. In combination, they facilitate a closed-loop workflow for the effective cooperation of health-care professionals and cancer patients. The solution approach is illustrated for an exemplary case scenario of colorectal cancer.

AB Blockchain and its most selling point decentralization have attracted lots of attentions. However, the problem of centralized mining pools (also called outsourcing problem) is a serious threat to the fundamental security of Bitcoin and other blockchains that also use a scratch-off puzzle (Miller et al. in Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGSAC conference on computer and communications security, 2015). Although there are some solutions proposing "nonoutsourceable puzzles" to stop the pool operators in the centralized mining pools from outsourcing their mining work to others, we find that none of them can be adopted in real world to support strong nonoutsourceability. In other words, through some special means, e.g., legal prosecution or a tainted public reputation, the pool operator still can outsource his mining work. In this paper, we study the formal definition of strong nonoutsourceability and present constructions that support strong nonoutsourceability. The experimental results also show that our concrete construction is practical.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Metaheuristic intelligent optimization algorithm is an effective method to settle high-dimensional nonlinear complicated optimization problems. Slime mould algorithm is a novel intelligent optimization algorithm proposed in 2020. However, the basic slime mould algorithm still has shortcomings, such as slow convergence rate, easy falling into local extremum, and imbalanced exploration and exploitation capabilities. To further enhance the optimization capability and expand the application scope of the slime mould algorithm, a slime mould algorithm based on the mechanism of multi-strategy information interaction and optimally oriented initialization (MSII-SMA) is proposed. Three improved mechanisms are introduced into the algorithm and the time complexity of MSII-SMA is analyzed. To verify the optimization effect, MSII-SMA and the other 5 typical comparison algorithms are applied to settle the CEC2015 test function set. The analysis of the optimization accuracy, convergence curve, Friedman test, boxplot and scalability test shows that the optimization ability, convergence rate, stability and scalability of MSII-SMA are evidently better than the comparison algorithm. Finally, MSII-SMA and other comparison algorithms are used to settle engineering design optimization problems with different complexity. The experimental results verify the universality, reliability and preponderance of MSII-SMA in dealing with engineering design constraint optimization problems.

AB Since computer vision has been a very emerging and happening approach in image categorization, this article describes how chest X-ray images of diverse infected and normal samples were classified using convolution neural networks, mostly under the following five categories: normal or no lung infection, COVID-19, SARS, ARDS and other pneumonia infections such as viral pneumonia, cavitating pneumonia, streptococcus pneumonia, legionella pneumonia and pneumocystis pneumonia. The proposed approach accepts the X-ray image inputs and diagnoses the lung infection under the aforementioned five categories of major pneumonia infections. Pre-trained models like VGG19, Resnet-50, and NasNetMobile are applied to the diagnosis of chest X-ray images, and their performance is compared against a newly proposed convolutional neural network called the COVNET 2020, since the network is inspired to identify the COVID-19 chest X-ray images. Transfer learning with pre-rained neural networks on massive image databases like "imagenet" has become de facto for medical image diagnosis.

AB We propose a novel Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model for sparse optimization based on the polyhedral k-norm. We put special emphasis on the application of sparse optimization in Feature Selection for Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification. We address the continuous relaxation of the problem, which comes out in the form of a fractional programming problem (FPP). In particular, we consider a possible way for tackling FPP by reformulating it via a DC (Difference of Convex) decomposition. We also overview the SVM models and the related Feature Selection in terms of multi-objective optimization. The results of some numerical experiments on benchmark classification datasets are reported.

AB The study was aimed at developing a new automatic search technique for specific invariant patterns of movement-related brain potentials reflected in multidimensional electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. An adaptive band-pass filter with bandwidth closely matching the spectrum of the desired EEG pattern at the observed moment was synthesized based on the Singular Spectrum Analysis methodology. The preliminary filtering of the original EEG signals provides the required sensitivity for subsequent searching of time boundaries in patterns. The correctness of the developed method was confirmed with standard machine learning tools through the validation of the adaptive search method carried out on the general set of initial data. It is shown that the synthesized method has provided a reliable automatic search for induced pre-movement EEG patterns and the correct determination of their time boundaries (accuracy up 29% on average and reached maximum values to 100% for some individuals). The developed method expands the existing tools to improve the functionality and reliability of various Brain-computer interfaces for various purposes, including medical applications for paralyzed patients.

AB Vehicle ad hoc network is used on the road where vehicles serve as mobile nodes. VANET's primary uses include intelligent transportation and active security. The framework for intelligent transportation systems relies heavily on VANETs. Intelligent transportation networks are sometimes used to refer to VANETs. In VANETs, however, authentication and user privacy remain crucial issues. This study proposes a novel method for privacy-based authentication algorithms that improve the accuracy of data transmission for smart VANET transportation. Here, a lightweight hybrid authentication-based privacy-preserving algorithm is used to improve privacy. Then, an effective congestion-based clustering algorithm is used to send the data. Throughput, QoS, latency, computational cost, and data transmission rate are the focus of the experimental analysis. Throughput, QoS, latency, computational cost, and data transmission rate were all achieved using the proposed method. The proposed method makes use of lightweight, efficient pseudonyms that can be used for both message authentication and as a trapdoor to provide conditional anonymity. The proposed method's ability to withstand a variety of security and privacy threats is demonstrated by the various attack scenarios and the proposed technique attained throughput 93%, QoS 55%, latency 62%, computational cost 63%, and data transmission rate 69%.

AB Compared to all extensions of fuzzy sets, probabilistic dual hesitant fuzzy (PDHF) sets are considered preferable. Here, we merge the advantages of the Dombi and Archimedean operators for resolving problems with group decision-making in a PDHF environment. The current study on PDHF term sets needs to concentrate on the decision experts' subjective and objective weights. The evaluation's findings will be distorted. To address this scenario, we use the notions of consistency and similarity among the decision experts in this work to calculate the subjective and objective weights of the decision experts, respectively. The grey correlation coefficient of the assessed value of the criteria is used to reflect the similarity between the criteria and its reference value when calculating the criteria weights. We propose PDHF weighted averaging and geometric aggregation operators for aggregating experts' evaluation and criteria values. We provide a case study for the assessment of sustainable material selection. Finally, to ensure that our methodology is consistent, we investigated the sensitivity analysis of the parameter and comparisons with existing methods."

ID RELIABILITY PREDICTION; MODEL; SELECTION
AB Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are more often appropriate for assessing the quality of the closed-source projects including their development lifecycles because they are dependent on underlying assumptions. It is debatable whether they should be used in open-source software (OSS) initiatives. There are studies examining the SRGMs' applicability in the OSS setting, but their scope is constrained by the models and projects they take into account, which could result in inconsistent findings. In this paper, the available SRGMs in the backdrop of OSS have been scrutinized and limitations have been identified. To address these limitations, a modification to the SRGMs using fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) has been proposed. In this paper, various SRGMs have been reviewed and sharp distinction among the same has been made, taking their respective failure intensity and mean value function under consideration. Through the failure intensity of software, it becomes a cakewalk to identify and predict the faults even before they actually arise and necessary and timely action may be initiated. After duly considering the review and contrast between the factors, a FNN model has been suggested for determination of software reliability differing with values of failure intensity and mean value function. First software failure data from a number of open-source software (OSS) projects have been gathered as part of the methodology used to modify traditional SRGMs. The proposed model gives out a high reliability rate and a low failure intensity. The most important factor is that it caters for the faults that are current and are being faced by the users on day to basis currently. It was found that the proposed model has a high success rate with the value of 82.6950937% which is considered as a successful result for software. The suggested FNN model may have a potential impact on the field of software reliability since FNN can handle the ambiguity and imprecision in the software failure data that are typical in open-source projects.

DE knowledge representation; lifelong reinforcement learning; zero-shot

AB Lifelong reinforcement learning is able to continually accumulate shared knowledge by estimating the inter-task relationships based on training data for the learned tasks in order to accelerate learning for new tasks by knowledge reuse. The existing methods employ a linear model to represent the inter-task relationships by incorporating task features in order to accomplish a new task without any learning. But these methods may be ineffective for general scenarios, where linear models build inter-task relationships from low-dimensional task features to high-dimensional policy parameters space. Also, the deficiency of calculating errors from objective function may arise in the lifelong reinforcement learning process when some errors of policy parameters restrain others due to inter-parameter correlation. In this paper, we develop a policy generation network that nonlinearly models the inter-task relationships by mapping low-dimensional task features to the high-dimensional policy parameters, in order to represent the shared knowledge more effectively. At the same time, we propose a novel objective function of lifelong reinforcement learning to relieve the deficiency of calculating errors by adding weight constraints for errors. We empirically demonstrate that our method improves the zero-shot policy performance across a variety of dynamical systems.

AB Skin cancer becomes a deadly disease that affect people of all ages globally. The availability of various types of benign and malignant melanoma makes the skin lesion diagnostic process difficult. Since the visual inspection of skin cancer is costlier and lengthy process, it is needed to design automatic diagnosis model to classify skin lesions accurately and promptly. Computer-aided diagnosis models can be employed to identify the presence of skin lesions using dermoscopic images. The automatic identification of skin lesions can assist the doctors and enable the detection process at an efficient and faster rate. With this motivation, this article presents an automated skin lesion detection and classification using fused deep convolutional neural network (ASDC-FDCNN) on dermoscopic images. The ASDC-FDCNN technique aims to identify the existence of skin lesions from dermoscopic images. The ASDC-FDCNN model involves the design of two deep learning models namely VGG19 and ResNet152 models. Besides, the fusion based feature extraction process is performed to derive feature vectors. In addition, the DCNN technique was employed as classifier for identifying the presence or absence of skin lesions. The performance validation of the ASDC-FDCNN technique takes place utilizing benchmark skin lesion dataset. A comparative results analysis reported the better performance of the ASDC-FDCNN model over the recent technique with respect to various measures.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
AB Path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or its variant supported with weapon systems, also called unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), is one of the most crucial steps for the autonomous flight and requires compelling decisions being made by considering the existence of the enemy defence, obstacles, and battery or fuel capacity of the vehicle optimally before starting the flight. Immune plasma algorithm (IP algorithm or IPA), inspired by the convalescent plasma treatment which is a medical method being popularized again with the rise of new coronavirus or COVID-19, has been introduced recently as a new optimization technique and the promising performance of the mentioned algorithm validated through a set of numerical and engineering problems. In this study, the IP algorithm was specialized as a three-dimensional UCAV path planner for the first time. Its performance was investigated particularly by using three different battlefield environments and assigning various constants to the population size. Moreover, the effect of two IPA-specific control parameters that are responsible for determining the number of donors and number of receivers on the qualities of the calculated paths were analyzed in detail. The results obtained by the IPA were compared with the results of other three-dimensional path planners guiding optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA), gray wolf optimizer (GWO) and symbiotic organism search (SOS). Experimental studies showed that the main idea lying behind the usage of qualified solutions as donors and transferring information directly from them to the receivers representing the poor solutions of the problem gives a positive contribution to the exploitation-dominant operations of IPA and fully complies with the challenging requirements of the path planning problem. Especially in the battlefields for which an optimal or near optimal path contains complex maneuvers, the advantages from the subtly balanced operational steps of the IPA become more apparent by setting the number of donors and receivers appropriately and IPA is found to be more stable and successful compared to the other tested algorithms.

ID DESIGN
AB Aiming at the problems of difficulty in determining the contracting-expanding factor parameters, inability to realize adaptive adjustment of the fuzzy universe, and serious time delay of the system in the traditional variable universe fuzzy control of vehicles, an improved variable universe fuzzy control strategy with real-time adjustment of the contracting-expanding factor parameters is proposed to improve the ride comfort of vehicles. Combining the respective advantages of functional and fuzzy contracting-expanding factors, an adaptive contracting-expanding factor controller is designed according to the system error e(t) and its change rate ec(t) to realize the adaptive adjustment of the system universe, which effectively solves the problem of poor control effect caused by the contracting-expanding factor parameters cannot be adjusted adaptively according to the system feedback information in the traditional variable universe fuzzy control. The effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed algorithm are verified by simulation analysis and scale experiments based on the similarity theory under multiple working conditions. The research results show that the proposed enhanced variable universe fuzzy control based on adaptive contracting-expanding factors has strong adaptability and can effectively improve the ride comfort and handling stability of vehicles under different vehicle speeds and road excitations, which also can provide a certain technical basis for the development of the vehicle active suspension systems.

AB Traditional fuzzy set theory has recently demonstrated its inefficiency in handling linguistic terms directly, including the degree of neutrality in medical diagnoses. Most decision support systems in medical diagnoses are restricted since both explicit and tacit knowledge of doctors involving linguistic semantics while making decisions have not been considered in the system. Thus this paper has presented a novel approach utilizing hedge algebra and picture fuzzy sets applying for a medical decision support system. In the proposed model, picture fuzzy rule-based approach and hedge algebra using linguistic semantics are used to express rules and preferences which aims to support doctors in diagnosing patients. Experimental results in simulations for the proposed method demonstrate a high level of precision and confidence, indicating its potential utilization in medical diagnostic domain.

TI Linear cuts in Boolean networks
SO NATURAL COMPUTING

DT Article
DE Boolean networks; Updating semantics; Reachability; Attractors
AB Boolean networks are popular tools for the exploration of qualitative dynamical properties of biological systems. Several dynamical interpretations have been proposed based on the same logical structure that captures the interactions between Boolean components. They reproduce, in different degrees, the behaviours emerging in more quantitative models. In particular, regulatory conflicts can prevent the standard asynchronous dynamics from reproducing some trajectories that might be expected upon inspection of more detailed models. We introduce and study the class of networks with linear cuts, where linear components-intermediates with a single regulator and a single target-eliminate the aforementioned regulatory conflicts. The interaction graph of a Boolean network admits a linear cut when a linear component occurs in each cycle and in each path from components with multiple targets to components with multiple regulators. Under this structural condition the attractors are in one-to-one correspondence with the minimal trap spaces, and the reachability of attractors can also be easily characterized. Linear cuts provide the base for a new interpretation of the Boolean semantics that captures all behaviours of multi-valued refinements with regulatory thresholds that are uniquely defined for each interaction, and contribute a new approach for the investigation of behaviour of logical models.

AB Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown significant results in 3D face reconstruction. By harnessing the power of convolutional neural networks, significant progress has been made in recovering 3D face shapes from single images using the 3D Morphable Model approach. However, training neural networks typically requires a large amount of data, while face images with ground-truth 3D face shapes are scarce. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework for accurate 3D face reconstruction from a single image. Our key idea is to process the images generated by a differentiable renderer and leverage the advantages of Generative Adversarial Networks to train a powerful neural renderer that produces highly realistic face images resembling the input image. We then modify traditional fitting methods to exploit the advantages of the neural renderer in finding optimal face parameters for improved 3D face reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating more accurate 3D face reconstruction results.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is one of the most popular optimization algorithms that has been adopted in various fields, including design, scheduling, and biochemistry. However, the algorithm is time-consuming when facing high-dimensional or multi-objective optimizing problems. Parallel PSO is thus proposed to improve its computing efficiency, and many studies have been conducted. However, the low-level system design is seldom considered in parallel programming, which may have a nonnegligible impact on computing efficiency, creating a gap between low-level optimization and highlevel algorithm design. Therefore, this paper proposes a Parallel Asynchronous PSO (PAPSO) framework based on thread pools utilizing multicore processors and adopts a cross-level approach to bridge the gap. A series of experiments are designed and conducted to examine how the aforementioned method can improve the parallel execution efficiency of PSO compared with the OpenMP framework and nonparallel PSO. Results indicate that PAPSO can significantly improve PSO computing efficiency by reducing the elapsed time, approaching approximately 20% optimization compared with OpenMP. Additionally, it achieves an approximately linear speedup of up to 4.5 threads. In addition, the particle communication experiment shows that the nonblocking communication protocol is effective for maintaining the computing elapsed time in the same level facing different neighborhood sizes. Finally, the work-stealing mechanism achieves an average of 16% improvement for general computing scenarios and maintain up to 16% improvement for imbalanced workload scenarios. Generally, the major contribution of this paper is that we innovate the thread pooling management concept with the fork-join model in parallelizing PSO to make sufficient use of multiple core CPUs for parallel computing through multithread programming.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) is a heuristic optimization approach that estimates global optima for optimization problems using operators based on chaos theory. This paper first proposes a multiobjective variant of this recent algorithm using decomposition. The proposed algorithm is called Multi-Objective CGO based on Decomposition (MOCGO/D), in which the decomposition step employs a Normalized Boundary Intersection (NBI) technique for decomposing the multi-objective problem into single-objective sub-problems. A novel Random Learning (RL) strategy based on the combination of multiple strategies such as Opposition-based learning, Levy flight operator, Orthogonal learning, and the tangent flight operator, is incorporated in the MOCGO/D to propose an enhanced version called MOCGO/DR algorithm. The RL strategy aims to improve the balance between exploitation and exploration of the conventional CGO, leading to better convergence behavior and avoiding getting trapped in local optima. The first set of experimental results demonstrates that MOCGO/DR can perform better than three other variants of MOCGO, namely archive-based MOCGO (MOCGO/A), crowdingdistance based MOCGO (MOCGO/CD) and decomposition-based MOCGO (MOCGO/D) on 62% of test cases. A second set of experiments and evaluation shows that the proposed approach provides better results than well-regarded algorithms, including strength pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2), multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MPSO/D), multistage evolutionary algorithm (MSEA), and a fast and elitist multi- objective genetic algorithm (NSGAII) when using performance measures such as GD, IGD, HV, Spacing, Spread, and Hausdorff distance on 65% test cases. This two-stage evaluation was conducted on three different benchmark test sets: the Deb-Thiele-Laumanns-Zitzler (DTLZ) test suite, the Zitzler-Deb-Thiele (ZDT) test suite, and the bias test suite (BT). Overall, the Friedman test results for all performance measures show that MOCGO/DR is demonstrated to be a competitive candidate as a multi-objective optimization algorithm in this space.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-label data classification (MLC) has become an increasingly active research area over the past decade. MLC refers to a classification problem where each instance can be associated with more than one class label. Capturing the correlation among labels and tackling the label imbalance are the main challenges in MLC. Problem transformation is one of the well-known approaches in this area that became the de-facto approach for MLC. Existing methods in this approach consider MLC as a collection of single-label tasks and solve each of them separately. To consider correlation among labels, some of them consider the combination of labels that appear in the training data as a separate label. The main drawback of these kinds of methods is the complexity of the model, which makes them not applicable in real-world applications. In this paper, we show how MLC can be efficiently and effectively tackled with a single classifier. Our proposed method maps the training data into a new sub-space for each label. Then, it pools all the mapped data together and efficiently trains a single classifier for all the labels together. Experimental results show that our method successfully tackles MLC tasks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

AB This article concerns the problem of fixed-time stability (FXTS) of a Cohen-Grossberg bidirectional associative memory neural network (CGBAMNN) with destabilizing impulsive effects. A novel sufficient condition for the impulsive dynamical systems (IDSs) to be FXTS for destabilizing impulses is obtained. Different from the usual Lyapunov inequality for FXTS of IDSs, we have applied a new Lyapunov inequality to obtain the results under impulsive perturbations. Based on the average impulsive interval (AII) and the comparison principle, we have derived the results of this paper. Two types of continuous controllers: one with signum terms and another without signum terms, based on a new Lyapunov inequality, FXTS of CGBAMNN have been studied. The settling-time functions obtained in this article depend on the parameters of the impulsive sequences. Finally, two numerical examples, one is a cyber-physical system with deception attacks and another is a neural network, are given to validate the efficiency of our obtained theoretical results.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Emotion recognition has been drawing the attention of researchers and practitioners in recent years. While various research studies show successful applications to recognize and distinguish emotions based on physiological responses using machine learning techniques, less research to date is focused on the network properties of physiological interactions under different emotional states. To this end, we pro-pose a multi-modal graph learning framework to quantify the interactions among physiological systems and present representative networks associated with emotional states. More specifically, we introduce a novel information-theoretic-based time delay stability to quantify complex interactions between physio-logical modalities. We test our quantification approach on three publicly available benchmark databases for emotion recognition and demonstrate the comparative performances of measuring the interactions of physiological systems in response to emotional states. Finally, we present the visualization of multi-modal physiological network topology, which may be useful for emotional interpretations in practice. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Prediction and diagnosis of diabetes are critical issues in the field of smart healthcare. However, the dependence of large-scale annotated diabetes data and the lack of diabetes knowledge represent significant challenges for diabetes prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a new diabetes prediction model named KE-CNN, which combines knowledge extension and convolution neural network. The KE-CNN model first extracts abnormal indicator features from physical examination index data of diabetic patients and uses Word2vec to embed the feature words. We then employ entity recognition technique named BERT-BiLSTM-CRF to identify medical entities in the condition description text and utilize a knowledge graph to extend the knowledge of each medical entity, followed by using pre-trained Chinese word vectors to embed the extended description text. Finally, we construct a semantic enhanced convolutional neural network model with word embedding vectors and text embedding vectors as dual-channel input, aiming to enhance the feature expression of the KE-CNN model. Our model not only learns and captures more fine-grained features of diabetes information, but also significantly reduces the amount of data required for model training and improves the prediction performance of convolutional neural network models. Our experiments show that the KE-CNN model effectively improves the accuracy of diabetes prediction compared with the benchmark model.

AB The operation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) relies on three major motions: yaw, theta, and depth, each requiring its own set of proportional integral derivative (PID) controller gain criteria. Thus, different issues arise, including the availability of multiple criteria for optimization algorithm evaluation, the importance of these criteria, the trade-off between criterion performance, and criterion critical values. These issues make the evaluation of optimization algorithms for AUV motion control a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. This research proposes a novel selectionintegrated approach for AUV optimization algorithms in different motions using two MCDM methods: fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency (FWZIC) for criteria weighting and fuzzy decision by opinion score method (FDOSM) for optimization algorithm selection. The approach comprises three main phases: development of PID, FWZIC-based criteria weighting, and FDOSM-based optimization algorithm selection. In all three motion types - "depth", "yaw", and "theta"- Kp_& theta; had the highest weight value, with respective weights of 0.143, 0.149, and 0.142. In contrast, Ki_depth consistently received the lowest weight value across all three motion types, with respective weights of 0.057, 0.0598, and 0.057. Regarding the "depth"motion, the Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) was the highestperforming alternative with a score of 0.077, while the eagle strategy-particle swarm optimization algorithm was the worst alternative with a score of 0.022. The Cuckoo optimization algorithm was identified as the best alternative for the "yaw"motion with a score of 0.072, whereas black hole optimization had the lowest score of 0.036. The best alternative for the "theta"motion was AOA with a score of 0.067, and the worst algorithm was sunflower optimization with a score of 0.028. This developed approach was evaluated based on systematic ranking and sensitivity analysis, which confirmed the validity of the proposed work. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In the field of data mining, high utility itemset mining (HUIM) is a relevant mining task, with the aim of analyzing customer transaction databases. HUIM consists of exploiting the set of items that are often purchased together and yield high profit value. In real-world applications, transaction databases often come with item categorization, stored in a taxonomy. Items in these databases can be clustered into specific categories at higher levels of abstraction. Extracting and analyzing itemsets discovered from different levels of abstraction can provide more useful insights into customer behaviors. However, considering item taxonomy increases the problem's complexity, hence prolonging the execution time needed to explore the search space. Parallelism is thus employed to address this drawback, but previous approaches are not efficient as they only adopt simple scheduling strategies or do not utilize the full capabilities of a multi-core processor. This work introduces three new efficient strategies to significantly boost the performance of the multi-level high utility itemset mining task using multicore processing. Two new algorithms, called MCML+ and MCML++, are also proposed by adopting the suggested strategies. Extensive experiments on several large databases show that our proposed algorithms have better performance compared to previous approaches in terms of running time and scalability, up to 4.0 times better than the previous parallelized algorithm, the MCML-Miner algorithm; and over 9.0 times faster than the original sequential algorithm, the MLHUI-Miner algorithm. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB To enable a mobile manipulator to perform human tasks from a single teaching demonstration is vital to flexible automation. We call our proposed method MMPA (Mobile Manipulator Process Automation with One-shot Teaching). Currently, there is no effective and robust MMPA framework which is not influenced by the mobile base's parking precision. The proposed MMPA framework consists of two stages: collecting data (mobile base's location, environment information, end-effector's path) in the teaching stage for robot learning; letting the end-effector repeat the nearly same path as the reference path in the world frame to reproduce the work in the automation stage. More specifically, in the automation stage, the robot navigates to the specified location without the need of a precise parking. Then, based on colored point cloud registration, the proposed IPE (Iterative Pose Estimation by Eye & Hand) algorithm could estimate the accurate 6D relative parking pose of the robot arm base without the need of any marker. Finally, the robot could learn the error compensation from the parking pose's bias to modify the end-effector's path to make it repeat a nearly same path in the world coordinate system as recorded in the teaching stage. Hundreds of trials have been conducted with a real mobile manipulator to show the superior robustness of the system and the accuracy of the process automation regardless of the parking precision.

First, the leader-follower MASs over finite fields are modeled as algebraic form, based on which, the output consensus problem is transformed into the set stabilization problem about the systems with algebraic form. Second, all the output feedback control invariant sets (OFCISs) are calculated from the state feedback maximum control invariant set (SFMCIS). Third, some criteria of the output consensus as well as the design method of output feedback controller are presented by the truth matrix technique. Finally, an example is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Data visualization and decision-making are critical aspects of infrastructure inspections. Numerous research efforts have been made to develop practical remote inspection systems that overcome the limitations of conventional inspection methods. Although the integration of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) into remote inspection is currently being addressed, most IVR frameworks have focused on data accuracy and there has been a lack of research on developing human-centered IVR frameworks through usability evaluation. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a new IVR development framework utilizing agile User Experience (UX) design techniques, which can be implemented in remote infrastructure inspections for data visualization and decisionmaking. Usability tests were conducted through a case study with 22 participants, using an IVR prototype developed in accordance with this framework. Following its implementation, the framework demonstrated its ability to identify damage via remote bridge inspection and achieved acceptable usability. Future research can build on the framework for semantic enrichment tasks.

AB Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) plays a very vital role in many application fields. There are many classical methods to solve the MCDM problems if the available information is crisp. However, the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in the MCDM often makes these methods unsuitable for solving this kind of problem. Aims at the failures of TOPSIS method that can not rank the alternatives completely in a Hesitant Fuzzy beta-Covering Approximation Space (HF beta CAS), we develop an improved TOPSIS method. First, we define two pairs of hesitant fuzzy relationship based on hesitant fuzzy beta-neighborhood, and construct the corresponding hesitant fuzzy covering rough set models; further we discuss the properties and relationships between the models. Second, we introduce a new comprehensive weight determination method by using the precision degree of hesitant fuzzy covering rough set and the maximizing deviation method. Third, we construct a gamma-beta CHF-TOPSIS method to MCDM which generalizes the TOPSIS method in an HF beta CAS. Finally, two real decisionmaking problems are used to illustrate the concrete implementation process of gamma-beta CHF-TOPSIS method, and demonstrate its effectiveness and reasonability.

AB Machining performance, such as carbon emission, machining time, and quality, can be improved by selecting appropriate tools and cutting parameters for gear hobbing. However, the importance machining performance is usually difficult for users to quantify. To resolve the decision-making problem of hobbing tools and cutting parameters in fuzzy evaluation, a multi-objective fuzzy decision-making approach for hobbing parameters is proposed. It uses spectral clustering, the multi-objective weighted mean of vectors (MOINFO) algorithm and the fuzzy technique for ordering preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) algorithm. First, spectral clustering is used to confirm the initial range of the hobbing parameters based on past machining cases. MOINFO is then applied to search for nondominated hobbing parameters based on the optimization model, taking the carbon emission, cutting time, and quality as the objectives. Finally, the nondominated hobbing parameters are sorted by fuzzy TOPSIS according to a user evaluation, and the hobbing parameter ranking is used to guide hob selection and machining. Decision-making experiments on the hobbing parameters are performed with actual hobbing. The comprehensive evaluation index CEI result for the proposed approach is 0.19. Compared with other methods, the proposed approach exhibits certain advantages. These results demonstrate that the multi-objective decision-making problem of hobbing parameters under fuzzy evaluation can be solved using the proposed approach.

AB Ship imaging position plays an important role in visual navigation, and thus significant focuses have been paid to accurately extract ship imaging positions in maritime videos. Previous studies are mainly conducted in the horizontal ship detection manner from maritime image sequences. This can lead to unsatisfied ship detection performance due to that some background pixels maybe wrongly identified as ship contours. To address the issue, we propose a novel rotational you only look once (YOLO) based model (RYM) to accurately yet fast detect ships from maritime images by considering ship rotation angle. The proposed RYM model are designed to detect tilted ships from images with the help of a rotation decoupled (RD) head, attentional mechanism and bidirectional feature network (BiFPN). The experimental results suggested that RYM can obtain satisfied ship detection performance considering that average accuracy reaches 96.7%. The precision and recall indicators are 93.2% and 94.7%, respectively. The proposed framework can be applied into real-time ship detection task due to that the processing speed is 45.6 frames per second (FPS).

AB As science and technology have developed, an increasing amount of research on humanoid robots has been conducted. In this paper, a method based on deep reinforcement learning, optimization algorithms, and fuzzy logic for self-guided learning in humanoid robots is proposed. The method primarily relies on proximal policy optimization. The proposed model enables the humanoid robot to determine the optimal action on the basis of environmental feedback. A task was divided into two steps to train the optimal model for each step of the task; these models were then integrated. This division of the task was completed to prevent bias towards a single step. The performance of numerous optimization algorithms was evaluated, and the artificial bee colony algorithm was found to be the most successful algorithm for determining the optimal combination of parameters for the task. Deep reinforcement learning was demonstrated to be an effective method for enabling the humanoid robot to learn how to grasp objects and place them in target areas. The proposed learning method also combines optimization algorithms with fuzzy logic theory to further improve performance. The feasibility of the proposed method was validated through experiments.

AB To address the growing global concern regarding increased wildfire occurrences and their widespread socio-ecological impacts, cost-effective and practical approaches must be urgently identified to accurately predict the probability of wildfire incidents. The objective of this study was to develop deep learning models to estimate the likelihood of wildfire incidents and compare the predictive capability of the methods. To this end, the group method of data handling (GMDH) and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms were coupled with the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms to enhance the predictive performance of the models. Overall, 1745 historical wildfires were identified in the island of Maui, Hawai'i. Among them, 1221 events (70%) were randomly selected to generate the models, and the remaining 524 (30%) were used for validation. The frequency ratio, information gain ratio (IGR), and variance inflation factor methods were used to select the optimal number of predictor variables for model development. 13 influencing factors: elevation, aspect, slope, plan curvature, slope length, valley depth, topographic wetness index, mean annual wind speed, mean annual air temperature, mean monthly rainfall, distance to the road, distance to the river, and normalized difference vegetation index were selected to generate the proposed models and detect fire-prone areas. The IGR values indicated that the key parameters for predicting wildfire susceptibility were the distance to the road, mean annual air temperature, elevation, and slope. Finally, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was computed to verify the reliability and accuracy of the wildfire susceptibility maps. Both the optimization algorithms enhanced the performances of the GMDH and CNN models. The ACO most notably enhanced the CNN performance compared with the models (AUROCTraining = 0.889 and AUROCTest ing = 0.885). The findings demonstrated the potential of coupled models in overcoming the limitations of individual models for mapping fire-susceptible areas and analyzing the multifactorial aspects that lead to wildfire occurrence. Overall, the proposed frameworks can be used to predict the spatio-temporal patterns of wildfire occurrence, which are of significance for land management, wildfire prevention, and mitigation of wildfire consequences.

AB This article presents a novel self-healing fault accommodation framework for high-order fully actuated systems (HOFASs) with sensor faults. Starting from the HOFAS model with nonlinear measurements, a q-redundant observation proposition is derived from an observability normal form based on each individual measurement. On the heels of the ultimately uniformly bounded error dynamics, a definition of sensor fault accommodation is determined. After a necessary and sufficient accommodation condition is highlighted, a self-healing fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed, which can be applied in steady-state processes or transient processes. The main results are proved theoretically and illustrated experimentally.

AB Based on actor-critic neural networks (NNs), an optimal controller is proposed for solving the constrained control problem of an affine nonlinear discrete-time system with disturbances. The actor NNs provide the control signals and the critic NNs work as the performance indicators of the controller. By converting the original state constraints into new input constraints and state constraints, the penalty functions are introduced into the cost function, and then the constrained optimal control problem is transformed into an unconstrained one. Further, the relationship between the optimal control input and worst-case disturbance is obtained using the Game theory. With Lyapunov stability theory, the control signals are ensured to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the control algorithms is tested through a numeral simulation using a third-order dynamic system.

AB Numerous efforts in the additive manufacturing literature have been made toward in-situ defect prediction for process control and optimization. However, the current work in the literature is limited by the need for multi-sensory data in appropriate resolution and scale to capture defects reliably and the need for systematic experimental and data-driven modeling validation to prove utility. For the first time in literature, we propose a data-driven neural network framework capable of in-situ microporosity localization for laser powder bed fusion via exclusively within hatch strip of sensory data, as opposed to a threedimensional neighborhood of sensory data. We further propose using prior-guided neural networks to utilize the often-abundant nominal data in the form of a prior loss, enabling the machine learning structure to comply more with process physics. The proposed methods are validated via rigorous experimental data sets of high-strength aluminum A205 parts, repeated k-fold cross-validation, and prior-guided validation. Using exclusively within hatch stripe data, we detect and localize porosity with a spherical equivalent diameter (SED) smaller than 50.00 mu m with a classification accuracy of 73.13 +/- 1.57% This is the first work in the literature demonstrating in-situ localization of porosities as small as 38.12 mu m SED and is more than a five-fold improvement on the smallest SED porosity localization via spectral emissions sensory data in the literature. In-situ localizing micro-porosity using exclusively within hatch-stripe data is a significant step towards within-layer defect mitigation, advanced process feedback control, and compliance with the reliability certification requirements of industries such as the aerospace industry.

AB The distributed heterogeneous permutation flowshop scheduling problem with lot-streaming (DHPFSPLS) is a provocative scheduling and optimization problem confronting both industry and engineering. However, no result is available in investigating the DHPFSPLS with variable number of sublots. This paper presents a many-objective mathematical model of this problem with the objectives of makespan, idle time of machines, total production cost and total flow time, considering the transfer time and sequence-independent setup time. Based on this model, a modified adaptive switching-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed, in which each solution is coded using a three-vector-based solution representation, i.e., a factory assignment vector, a lot-splitting vector and a job permutation vector. Then, a novel two-population collaborative search strategy based on a learning mechanism is designed, which can enhance exploitation abilities and make effective use of optimization knowledge from the population. Moreover, an adaptive switching strategy-based environmental selection is implemented to ensure the convergence and diversity of the solution set. Through a variety of computational tests and comparisons, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving the many-objective DHPFSPLS is demonstrated.

AB This paper concerns with the preassigned-time projective synchronization issue for delayed fully quaternion-valued discontinuous neural networks involving parameter uncertainties through the nonseparation method. Above all, based on the existing works, a new preassigned-time stability theorem is established. Subsequently, to realize the control goals, two types of novel and simple chattering-free quaternion controllers are designed, one without the power-law term and the other with a hyperbolictangent function. They are different from the existing common power-law controller and exponential controller. Thirdly, under the Filippov discontinuity theories and with the aid of quaternion inequality techniques, some novel succinct sufficient criteria are obtained to ensure the addressed systems to achieve the preassigned-time synchronization by using the preassigned-time stability theory. The preassigned settling time is free from any parameter and any initial value of the system, and can be preset according to the actual task demands. Particularly, unlike the existing results, the proposed control methods can effectively avoid the chattering phenomenon, and the time delay part is removed for simplicity. Additionally, the projection coefficient is generic quaternion-valued instead of realvalued or complex-valued, and some of the previous relevant results are extended. Lastly, numerical simulations are reported to substantiate the effectiveness of the control strategies, the merits of preassigned settling time, and the correctness of the acquired results. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Parkinson's disease consists in the degeneration of the mesencephalic black substance, affecting the dopaminer-gic vias. Its causes are varied, including exposure to pesticides, genetic factors and, one of the most influential ones, age. Given the decrease in dopamine levels, the most common symptoms are the appearance of tremors and muscle rigidity. Due to the rigidity of the muscles, the patient has voice alterations which have great potential for non-invasive and early diagnosis of the disease. In addition, considering the low cost of the sound recorder respect to the clinical studies, this approach allows the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in a large number of people. Recent works, which present the analysis of voice recordings through Convolutional Neural Networks, show high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Convolutional Neural Networks use a Multilayer Neural Network to classify convolutional feature vectors. In order to improve the training time of the classifier, in this paper the use Extreme Learning Machines are proposed. Experiments considering 4 types of spectrograms with AlexNet, VGG-16, SqueezeNet, Inception V3 and ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Networks models. In the experiments, hit rate, training and testing time, sensitivity and the specificity indicators of all the neural architectures involved in the work are objectively compared. It is shown that the Extreme Learning Machine have a high level of accuracy in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but with reduced training time.

AB Effective bridge maintenance requires sufficient and accurate knowledge on structural health. However, despite the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) and inspection aids, bridge structural health monitoring remains challenging. This work proposes a comprehensive predictive description based on Conceptual Graphs (CG), of the bridge condition deterioration mechanism, with the formalization of the inspection history. The model combines formalized assumptions with several deterioration factors and expert knowledge to assess the evolution of the structural condition. The model is based on logical and graphical descriptions of the deterioration of the structural condition thanks to the use of the CG modeling. Through the graphical inference, the evolution of the apparent condition and the deterioration time can be assessed. The application to two bridge cases highlights the interest of this approach to help understanding the sequence of deterioration. The actual condition obtained and the formalized inspection history allow a better decision.

AB With the advances in artificial intelligence, there is a growing expectation of more automatic and intelligent prognostics and health management (PHM) systems for the real-time monitoring of renewable energy systems. Although the deep learning significantly promotes the development of PHM, it generally works in a close-world assumption that the real-time monitoring data are in-distribution (ID). These methods may lack the ability to alert the system when encountering the out-of-distribution (OOD) data that are previously unseen/unknown. In this study, a unified OOD detection framework is proposed for the intelligent PHM, so as to enhance its reliability and trustworthiness. Specifically, two types of OOD data from unseen working conditions and unseen fault types are comprehensively considered in the unified framework. A class-wise outlier detection strategy is presented to detect the OOD inputs during decision-making. To suppress the unexpected distribution shift caused by variable working conditions, a novel generalization representation of learning towards unseen working conditions is developed by using supervised contrastive learning. The proposed OOD detection framework can not only flag the unreliable diagnostic output of deep learning models, but also reduce the interference of variable working conditions, showing its applicability in real application scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages and the significance of the proposed unified OOD detection framework to establish highly reliable and trustworthy PHM models.

AB The absence of a publicly available user-click dataset makes the task of fraudster identification particularly challenging to detect click fraud in online advertising. However, the task becomes more complicated with concept drift, where a publisher appears in distinct sets with the same pattern but differs in real status labels. Fraud-detection algorithms developed the actual status labels. The reliability of the predictions made by learning models needs to be examined to deal with the concept drift concerning the changing behaviour of fraudulent publishers without re-training the predictive model from scratch. However, the scarcity of pre-trained models aggravates the issue. Thus, we proposed a 1D-convolutional neural network-based fraudsters identification network (FINet) that deals with such challenges using a model trained on a correlated prediction modelling problem using transfer learning. To overcome the scarcity of pre-trained models, we designed a model FINet trained on the correlated dataset TalkingData Ad Tracking Fraud Detection (TDA) and utilized the weights of the trained model to learn a model on the FDMA2012 dataset better. This predicted modelling on a distinct but related problem is re-used for accelerating the training and improving the FINet's fraudster identification performance. The proposed FINet's behaviour is investigated based on eight optimizer algorithms in terms of Average Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC scores and performance generalization is verified by conducting experiments with existing state-of-art deep learning models. The implementation results are notably higher than the existing state-of-the-art deep learning models and exhibit effective performance towards fraudster's identification in detecting click fraud.

AB In this paper, first by using ideals in hoops we define a new congruence relation on hoops and we make a new quotient structure. Then, we introduce the concept of product ideal in hoops and investigate some properties of it and study some results about prime and maximal ideals and product of them. By using these notions, we define the concept of nilpotent ideal on hoops and we provide a condition for intersection of all maximal ideals to be nilpotent.

ID SERIES; ORDER
AB Constraint optimization redundancy allocation problem (CoRAP) is a real-world, complex integer programming problem. Many researchers have used a variety of techniques to solve CoRAP. In the last two decades, evolutionary algorithms have been used by researchers to handle a variety of complex problems. Among these, the spider monkey optimization algorithm (SMO), which focuses on the behavior of monkeys, is one of the most promising and recent developments by researchers. In addition, no work has been undertaken in the context of solving CoRAP for water treatment plants so far. This paper proposed an integer programming problem, CoRAP for water treatment reverse osmosis (RO) plants subject to a cost constraint. The spider monkey optimization technique is applied to optimize the redundant units of the components of the plant, due to which the overall system reliability is maximized. A review of spider monkey optimization applications and modifications are also presented to investigate its performance. The same problem is solved by the heuristic algorithm, the branch and bound method and student psychology-based optimization technique to compare performance. The simulation work of spider monkey optimization, heuristic algorithms and student psychology-based optimization is implemented using MATLAB and the results for the branch and bound method are obtained using LINGO software. The findings demonstrate the better performance of spider monkey optimization.

ID OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; NETWORKS
AB Most existing evolutionary algorithms encounter difficulties in dealing with multi-objective problems (MOPs) whose Pareto optimal solutions are sparse, especially when the decision space of the MOP is large. Most existing sparse evolutionary algorithms (EAs) lack the tricks specially for large-scale problems, and the existing tricks need some grouping/variable analysis methods to divide the large-scale variables, which severely affects the effect of optimization. To fill this gap, an evolutionary algorithm based on rank-1 approximation, suitable to reduce the dimensionality of sparse higher-order datasets, is proposed. First, canonical polyadic decomposition is introduced to divide the higher-dimensional set of decision variables into several lower-dimensional sub-sets. These sub-populations are alternatively optimized by a sparse evolution algorithm with special genetic strategies, to search for improved solutions in their respective lower-dimensional decision sub-space. Finally, the whole population is asymptotically optimized by all the sub-populations. The proposed algorithm first introduces the rank-1 approximation into the dimensionality reduction in sparse large-scale variables, combines it with the sparse EA, and proposes efficient alternative optimization strategy to solve the non-convex problem resulted from the multiple sub-problems. It is compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms for large-scale and sparse problems. The experimental results indicate that it outperforms other algorithms in terms of optimization performance and convergence rate.

   translation; Statement accuracy
AB The widely available data is exploding with the continuous development of the Internet, leading people to the era of big data. Nowadays, massive amounts of English information can generate information redundancy, which to some extent affects the user's information browsing and filtering process, and Chinese-English translation needs to be further improved in accuracy. Therefore, it is very important to summarize the information in English source text and accurately translate it into Chinese to help people effectively and quickly grasp the key points and basic knowledge of English articles, among which satisfying sentence accuracy is the most important. Based on this point, this article proposes a new type of Chinese-English translation system, which is equipped with a Q-learning virtual network and built-in processor. With the development of recent years, language recognition technology has become increasingly mature. In a sense, this technology can be said to be the "cornerstone" of fully realizing artificial intelligence technology. Nowadays, the background of embedded processor based language recognition systems is microprocessor platforms (such as chips), which can create language training models in language databases, and can match the models with speech fragments to be tested to complete recognition. In particular, recognizing non specific language has evolved from a laboratory environment to become increasingly practical. This paper designs and implements a class of Chinese-English translation systems based on embedded processors and Q-learning algorithms to optimize system speed and achieve efficient and convenient system processing.

ID WAVELENGTH REROUTING ALGORITHM
AB In the optical network, Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) is one of the most attractive areas for researchers in the current scenario. Although the study is going on GMPLS networks, very little research has been done on network survivability. There are some common problems in GMPLS networks, such as routing problems, wavelength assignment and multiple nodes and link failures. This paper investigates different protection and restoration techniques to develop the connection between the source and destination. A protection technique is proposed to handle all these crucial issues simultaneously by suggesting an efficient protection algorithm for dynamic rerouting in the GMPLS network. This technique enhances the efficiency of the network by utilizing all the resources present in the network. In this paper, the traffic is assumed to be dynamic. Further, this technique is also implemented on realistic network topologies such as NSFNET and EUROPEAN with multiple node failures. These networks' call blocking probabilities are compared by minimizing the time delay for different node failures. In addition, a network's behaviour of call blocking probabilities before and after node failure is also analysed.

AB Tardiness time constraints with an unknown due date, which have a broad range of applications in the manufacturing, mechanical, electrical, and other industries, are crucial in the research domains. Suppose a scheduling problem where the goal for assigning due dates is to create those as tight as feasible, but the goal for sequencing jobs is to minimize their tardiness. In the instance of a stochastic single-machine model with uniformly distributed task durations, we develop a variant of this market. This paper clarifies how to set a strict deadline and reduce job tardiness by determining the best order of the projects through two distinct phases. We create a genetic algorithm approach expected to find tightness of the due date of the issue and then compare it against a heuristic solution. These algorithms perform better than heuristic methods, and they also fit for small-scale non-parallel machine tardiness scheduling problems, according to numerical computational results focused on the various machine scheduling problems.

AB To investigate the influence of intra-articular sodium vitreous acid injection on knee function and inflammatory factors, Ninety-two patients with knee osteoarthritis as the study subjects and divided into the control cluster (CG, n = 46) and the study cluster (SG, n = 46) according to distinct healing methods. The control cluster received Deposone injection and the study cluster received intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injection. (1) Knee function mark scale (Lysholm) mark: Before healing, none remarkable variance in Lysholm mark between the two clusters. After healing, Lysholm mark was remarkably increased in both clusters. Lysholm mark in study cluster was upper than that within control cluster, and there was remarkable variance between the two clusters; (2) Visual analog scale (VAS): After healing, VAS mark was remarkably decreased in both clusters, VAS in study cluster was bottom than that within control cluster, and there was remarkable variance between the two clusters; (3) Serum inflammatory factors: before healing, none remarkable variance in serum TNF-& alpha;, PGE2, IL-1 & beta; and TNF-& alpha; levels between the two clusters. (4) Osteoarthritis index scale (WOMAC) mark: Before healing, none remarkable variance in WOMAC mark between the two clusters. In conclusion, intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injection helps to improve knee joint function and reduce the level of inflammatory factors. After healing, the pain degree and WOMAC mark of the patients are remarkably reduced. Therefore, intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injection therapy can be popularized and applied.

AB Traditionally, testing is done first at end of the design phase; however, this is no longer the case. Testing, finding, and categorising bugs, as well as releasing the development changes into the product, carry a price tag. If the test/verification team discovers a high-severity issue at the end of the lifecycle, the costs may climb. Even if all of the issues are resolved, the release could be delayed. Shift left testing is done in isolation by the test/verification team and does not increase testing time, but it has demonstrated to be in sync with product development in some cases. In the context of a process, shifting left refers to taking action early on. Shift left testing refers to the practise of testing software earlier in the development cycle than is customary, or to the left in the delivery pipeline, as opposed to the traditional practise of testing software later in the development cycle. Shifting to a "shift left" strategy assumes that the software development team may find bugs faster if they test their code as it is being written, rather than waiting until the end of the project based on fuzzy. Before the code is available for testing, shift left testing encourages developers to write test cases. An agile software development strategy known as "shift left" stresses putting test cases in place early in the life cycle of a project rather than at the conclusion. It also means that automated tests will cover a larger portion of a project's planned functionality rather to just a small portion. The shift left testing adoption benefits the organisation to reduce the development cost and time as the testing is done along with development to avoid delay in the process. This paper analyses the benefits of organisations who adopted shift left testing in the software development process.

AB In order to build a high-quality artificial intelligence teaching system, based on the feedback adjustment differential evolution algorithm, this paper constructs an artificial intelligence teaching model based on machine learning, which aims to minimize the total cost of normalized network resources. Moreover, this paper abstracts the SFC mapping problem into an integer linear programming problem, which simplifies the SFC mapping solution process, and proposes a business-aware greedy search algorithm. At the same time, this paper takes into account factors such as the betweenness centrality of data center nodes in DC-EON and the maximum overlap between SFCs to complete VNF deployment, and this paper considers the bandwidth request of the virtual link, the route length and the betweenness centrality of the link to realize the link mapping. In addition, in order to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm solution, this paper designs a feedback-adjusted differential evolution operator to optimize the individuals in the population. Finally, this paper designs experiments to study the performance of the algorithm and the model. From the experimental results, it can be seen that the algorithm and model proposed in this paper basically meet expectations.

AB The healthcare data is generated through blockchain databases, web-based databases and mobile applications-based data. This research is using machine intelligence to draw inferences from the healthcare data to generate futuristic data from it. In other words, the prediction of future health issues can be made using machine intelligence based on the prevailing trends of historical data. Concept drift refers to the phenomenon of dynamic changes in data distribution, which is commonly present in mobile health monitoring data that are susceptible to environmental influences, hindering medical analysis and decision-making. The research work proposes a latent distribution self-evolving architecture (LDSA) based on neuronal variants and latent distribution recombination (LDR) to achieve data representation and prediction in the context of concept drift of futuristic healthcare data. The genetic mechanism of LDSA can adaptively handle concept drift in data and drive latent data distribution towards the future, eventually achieving prediction of future data. The machine learning-based intelligent mechanism can predict the future cases of diabetic patients in the world by analysing the current and historical data of diabetic patients in the world. We also design an evolution loss function to optimize the model performance and improve the pattern generalization ability. Experimental results show that LDSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on mobile health datasets and has better drift adaptation than popular baseline methods. The proposed machine intelligence-based algorithm is able to predict the future data by learning from the historical data features. The healthcare industry will be greatly benefitted from this research work to predict the futuristic ailments in the population on the basis of changing healthcare parameters of the current population.

ID TERM SETS
AB Probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is an effective tool to describe qualitative evaluation, where decision-makers' hesitation is expressed by multiple linguistic terms and decision-makers' preferences for possible linguistic evaluations are obtained through probabilistic information. Recently, many multi-attribute decision models based on PLTSs have been developed greatly. However, the existing models fail to consider the interactions among multiple attributes under the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy sets for a decision-making problem given in the form of PLTSs. To solve this problem, a novel probabilistic linguistic decision-making model of discrete evidence is proposed in this paper. Specifically, an optimization model of evidence entropy is established to obtain non-additive attribute weights. Then by using these weights as fuzzy measures, a Choquet intuitionistic fuzzy logit (CIFL) model is defined to acquire decision results. The proposed CIFL model fully takes interactive attributes into account and extends the intuitionistic fuzzy logit (IFL) model. Finally, in a case study of an emergency plan selection, the optimal alternative is chosen correctly with the highest probability by the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis under two entropy functions and four scores, a comparative analysis with seven existing methods and a theoretical analysis are utilized to prove the rationality and validity of the developed model.

AB The experience economy has shifted consumer demands from the functional to the emotional, and the emotional demands of the user have become a key design consideration. At the same time, product form design often relies solely on the knowledge and experience of designers, resulting in uneven design results and difficult quality assurance. To this end, this paper proposes a product form design method that applies an image generation algorithm oriented toward satisfying the emotional demands of users. Firstly, product images from the network are collected and processed to build a dataset of product images, which is used to train the Diffusion Model (DM) to generate product images that differ from the dataset. Secondly, the Kansei factors are obtained by clustering Kansei words from online reviews using Factor Analysis (FA) and then calculating the weights of the Kansei factors by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Thirdly, a questionnaire is distributed to obtain user scores on the Kansei factors of the product images, and the Kansei evaluation value is calculated by weighting, then a prediction model is constructed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) to score and filter the generated images. Finally, the designer selects the highest-scoring images for detailing and tests the effectiveness of the design through user satisfaction. Using the ear thermometer as an example, we have created a product form that meets the emotional demands of users and verifies the scientific validity and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The popularization of online education, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the past few years, has promoted the development of online learning platforms. Consequently, the importance of optimal evaluation methods for online learning platforms has been emphasized. However, the uncertain decision-making process and complex indicators in the development of online learning platforms bring challenges to the evaluation, making it more difficult to reach a consensus. To address these issues, an online learning platform quality evaluation index system was first constructed in this paper, including system functionality, instructional Resources, social interaction, and teaching effectiveness. Secondly, regarding the fuzzy complexity of online learning platform evaluation, the concept of Pythagorean probabilistic linguistic term set (PPLTS) was proposed, effectively describing and measuring the complex information in the evaluation process of online learning platforms. On this basis, a series of aggregation methods of PPLTS were proposed, including the Pythagorean probabilistic linguistic term weighted average (PPLTWA) operator, the Pythagorean probabilistic linguistic term ordered weighted average (PPLTOWA) operator, and so on. Finally, a multi-criteria comprehensive evaluation framework in the case of PPLTS was given, and its application in the selection of online learning platforms was studied. Finally, some relevant policy suggestions were put forward to promote the development of online learning platforms. This study will not only help enrich the evaluation index system of online learning platforms, but also provide scientific evaluation method reference for researchers.

AB IntroductionThe issue of low detection rates and high false negative rates in maritime search and rescue operations has been a critical problem in current target detection algorithms. This is mainly due to the complex maritime environment and the small size of most targets. These challenges affect the algorithms' robustness and generalization. MethodsWe proposed YOLOv7-CSAW, an improved maritime search and rescue target detection algorithm based on YOLOv7. We used the K-means++ algorithm for the optimal size determination of prior anchor boxes, ensuring an accurate match with actual objects. The C2f module was incorporated for a lightweight model capable of obtaining richer gradient flow information. The model's perception of small target features was increased with the non-parameter simple attention module (SimAM). We further upgraded the feature fusion network to an adaptive feature fusion network (ASFF) to address the lack of high-level semantic features in small targets. Lastly, we implemented the wise intersection over union (WIoU) loss function to tackle large positioning errors and missed detections. ResultsOur algorithm was extensively tested on a maritime search and rescue dataset with YOLOv7 as the baseline model. We observed a significant improvement in the detection performance compared to traditional deep learning algorithms, with a mean average precision (mAP) improvement of 10.73% over the baseline model. DiscussionYOLOv7-CSAW significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of small target detection in complex scenes. This algorithm effectively addresses the common issues experienced in maritime search and rescue operations, specifically improving the detection rates and reducing false negatives, proving to be a superior alternative to current target detection algorithms.

AB Neural networks with branched architectures, namely, tree-structured models, have been employed to jointly tackle multiple vision tasks in the context of multitask learning (MTL). Such tree-structured networks typically start with a number of shared layers, after which different tasks branch out into their own sequence of layers. Hence, the major challenge is to determine where to branch out for each task given a backbone model to optimize for both task accuracy and computation efficiency. To address the challenge, this article proposes a recommendation system that, given a set of tasks and a convolutional neural network-based backbone model, automatically suggests tree-structured multitask architectures that could achieve a high task performance while meeting a user-specified computation budget without performing model training. Extensive evaluations on popular MTL benchmarks show that the recommended architectures could achieve competitive task accuracy and computation efficiency compared with state-of-the-art MTL methods. Our tree-structured multitask model recommender is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/zhanglijun95/TreeMTL.

AB Detection of small objects in natural scene images is a complicated problem due to the blur and depth found in the images. Detecting house numbers from the natural scene images in real-time is a computer vision problem. On the other hand, convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning methods have been widely used in object detection in recent years. In this study, firstly, a classical CNN-based approach is used to detect house numbers with locations from natural images in real-time. Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, among the commonly used CNN models, models were applied. However, satisfactory results could not be obtained due to the small size and variable depth of the door plate objects. A new approach using the fine-tuning technique is proposed to improve the performance of CNN-based deep learning models. Experimental evaluations were made on real data from Kayseri province. Classic Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 methods yield f1 scores of 0.763, 0.677, 0.880, 0.943 and 0.842, respectively. The proposed fine-tuned Faster R-CNN, MobileNet, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOv7 approaches achieved f1 scores of 0.845, 0.775, 0.932, 0.972 and 0.889, respectively. Thanks to the proposed fine-tuned approach, the f1 score of all models has increased. Regarding the run time of the methods, classic Faster R-CNN detects 0.603 seconds, while fine-tuned Faster R-CNN detects 0.633 seconds. Classic MobileNet detects 0.046 seconds, while fine-tuned MobileNet detects 0.048 seconds. Classic YOLOv4 and fine-tuned YOLOv4 detect 0.235 and 0.240 seconds, respectively. Classic YOLOv5 and fine-tuned YOLOv5 detect 0.015 seconds, and classic YOLOv7 and fine-tuned YOLOv7 detect objects in 0.009 seconds. While the YOLOv7 model was the fastest running model with an average running time of 0.009 seconds, the proposed fine-tuned YOLOv5 approach achieved the highest performance with an f1 score of 0.972.

AB The increase in anxiety levels worldwide can be described as a serious global health threat. Around 500 million people suffer from mental disorders and are suffering from depression, and other mental-oriented disabilities. The new technological paradigms such as the Internet of Things (IoT) were employed for detecting, and treating these disorders, which are being proposed, developed, and provide new capabilities to detect, assess and care for anxious people. These possibilities lead to several issues that are identified, which relate to patient privacy and confidentiality, security challenges such as data security, and the organization of IoT systems. To rectify these issues, we implement the Smart analysis of anxious people and their activities using Heterogeneous computing with virtual sensing. This system consists of the health application featuring the technique of the internet of things, heterogeneous computing, Cognitive Quasiperiodic motion, and Pentagonal tiling. This system introduces the internet of things-assisted smart analysis of anxiety against people with their activities. It performs the optimization analysis for improving the levels. The observational results focus on how to deal with the issues which were overcome in the analysis levels of the anxiety disorders, which show that time spent using the heterogeneous computing with the virtual sense proves more accuracy (92.3%), specificity (Degrees of anxiety severity by 20%), precision (Analysis of anxiety stress level by 65%), and recall (Anxiety chances percentile by 65.34%). The proposed model is simulated, and the outcomes are compared with the prevailing methods for evaluating the parameters like accuracy, end-end-end delay, energy consumption, network lifetime, and throughput.

ID CONSTRUCTION
AB In this paper we present two algorithms for computing the g-asymptotes or generalized asymptotes, of a plane algebraic curve, c , implicitly or parametrically defined. The asymptotes of a curve c reflect the status of c at points with sufficiently large coordinates. It is well known that an asymptote of a curve c is a line such that the distance between c and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. However, a curve c may have more general curves than lines describing the status of c at infinity. These curves are known as g-asymptotes or generalized asymptotes. The pseudocodes of these algorithms are presented, as well as the corresponding implementations. For this purpose, we use the algebra software Maple. A comparative analysis of the algorithms is carried out, based on some properties of the input curves and their results to analyze the efficiency of the algorithms and to establish comparative criteria. The results presented in this paper are a starting point to generalize this study to surfaces or to curves defined by a non-rational parametrization, as well as to improve the efficiency of the algorithms. Additionally, the methods developed can provide a new and different approach in prediction (regression) or classification algorithms in the machine learning field.

AB Illustrations are only rarely formal components of mathematical proofs, however they are often very important for understanding proofs. Illustrations are almost unavoidable in geometry, and in many other fields illustrations are helpful for carrying ideas in a more suitable way than via words or formulas. The question is: if we want to automate theorem proving, can we automate creation of corresponding illustrations too? We report on a new, generic, simple, and flexible approach for automated generation of illustrated proofs. The proofs are generated using Larus, an automated prover for coherent logic, and corresponding illustrations are generated in the GCLC language. Animated illustrations are also supported.

AB Diversity of expertise is inherent to cultural evolution. When it is transparent, diversity of human knowledge is useful; when social conformity overcomes that transparency, "expertise" can lead to divisiveness. This is especially true today, where social media has increasingly allowed misinformation to spread by prioritizing what is recent and popular, regardless of validity or general benefit. Whereas in traditional societies there was diversity of expertise, contemporary social media facilitates homophily, which isolates true subject experts from each other and from the wider population. Diversity of knowledge thus becomes social division. Here, we discuss the potential of a cultural-evolutionary framework designed for the countless choices in contemporary media. Cultural-evolutionary theory identifies key factors that determine whether communication networks unify or fragment knowledge. Our approach highlights two parameters: transparency of information and social conformity. By identifying online spaces exhibiting aggregate patterns of high popularity bias and low transparency of information, we can help define the "safe limits" of social conformity and information overload in digital communications.

AB Unsupervised learning and meta-learning share a common goal of enhancing learning efficiency compared to starting from scratch. However, meta-learning methods are predominantly employed in supervised settings, where acquiring labels for meta-training is costly and new tasks are limited to a predefined distribution of training tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised meta-learning framework that leverages spherical latent representations defined on a unit hypersphere. Unlike the state-of-the-art unsupervised meta-learning approach that assumes a Gaussian mixture prior over latent representations, we utilize a von Mises-Fisher mixture model for constructing the latent space. This alternative formulation leads to a more stable optimization process and improved performance. To enhance the generative capability of our model, we unify the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the generative adversarial network (GAN) within our unsupervised meta-learning framework. Moreover, we propose a dual VAE-GAN framework to impose a reconstruction constraint on both the latent representations and their corresponding transformed versions, thereby yielding more representative and discriminative representations. The efficacy of our proposed unsupervised meta-learning framework is demonstrated through extensive comparisons with existing methods on diverse benchmark datasets.

DE Session-based recommendation; Graph neural networks; Simplified GNN;
   Non-sequential GNN
AB Session-based recommender systems (SBR) aim to predict the next action of an anonymous user session. Recently Graph Neural Networks (GNN) models have gained a lot of attention in this task. Existing models learn sequential complex transition patterns using the Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) architecture. We argue that learning non-sequential complex transition patterns may be sufficient in SBR due to the short time interval and length of the sessions. To fully exploit the advantages of non-sequential GNN such as scalability, we design Simplified Graph Neural Network for Session-based Recommendation SimGNN, a non-sequential, linear GNN model for interaction representation. SimGNN uses the k-th power of the normalized adjacency matrix and the current session interactions to learn the k-th layer interaction representation. To improve the representation, SimGNN uses a highway gating mechanism. From the interaction representation learned by the proposed non-sequential and linear model, SimGNN models local preference and global preference and uses a proposed gating mechanism to aggregate these preferences. Experimental results showed that SimGNN outperforms state-of-the-art sequential GGNN models for SBR in terms of accuracy metrics - precision and mean reciprocal ranking.

AB In industrial settings, building a time series prediction model for new production lines or equipment with new sensors can be challenging due to a lack of historical data. Additionally, there is a temporal covariate shift (TCS) in time series data, which can lead to negative transfer when using transfer models with a single source domain. To this end, a Domain Adversarial-based Multi-source Deep Transfer Network (DA-MDTN) is proposed to transfer knowledge from multiple sub-source for cross-production-line time series forecasting. Firstly, the proposed approach utilizes a source domain segmentation strategy to obtain multiple sub-source domains with different distributions. Multi-way adaptation is then utilized to minimize the distribution difference between the target domain and each sub-source domain. Secondly, domain perplexity scores are taken as weight coefficients for each predictor to indicate the probability of target domain samples belonging to different sub-source domains under deep features. Thirdly, a training strategy of pre-training, multi-way adversarial learning, and predictor adaptation is employed to maximize the utilization of labeled data in the target domain to enhance prediction performance of the model in the target domain and to ensure the generalization ability of the model. Finally, DA-MDTN is evaluated using real data from the esterification stage of the DuPont three-reactors plant. The results indicate that the approach provides a viable solution for building time series prediction models in industrial processes with new equipment or production lines, where historical data may be limited, and there is a TCS in the time series data.

AB The ability to discern the shape of hands can be a vital issue in improving the performance of hand gesture recognition for human-computer interaction. Segmentation itself is a very challenging problem having various constraints like illumination variations, complex background etc. The objective of the paper is to incorporate the perception of semantic segmentation into a classification problem and make use of the deep neural models to achieve improved results for both static and dynamic gestures. This paper utilizes the UNet architecture with attention-module to obtain the semantically segmented masks of the input images, which are then fed to a classifier for recognition. The concept of attention-mechanism adds to the improvement of segmentation accuracy. In this work, for static gestures, the top classifier layer of the VGG16 model is replaced with a classifier designed specifically for classifying the gestures at hand. For dynamic gestures, 3D-CNN (C3D) architecture is used as a classifier that can capture spatial as well as temporal information of a gesture video. The data augmentation process is used in preprocessing to generate a sufficient number of training images for the aforementioned CNN-based models. Significant and improved recognition has been achieved for both static and dynamic hand gesture databases through the inherent feature learning capability of CNN and refined segmentation.

AB The effective integration of RGB and depth map features to improve the performance of RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) has garnered significant research interest. The existing dual-stream models can be used for high-level feature fusion or unidirectionally transferring depth features to RGB features; however, they are unable to fully exploit the differences in modality. Furthermore, owing to the influence of image background information, the generated salient object is affected by background swallow. Herein, a three-stream RGB-D SOD method based on cross-layer and cross-modal dual-attention (CMDA) fusion is proposed. In the encoding stage, the CMDA fusion module is used to fuse RGB and depth features layer by layer. Through this module, merged interactive features may be used to extract the richer features of salient objects, realize the commonality and complementarity of fusion features, and achieve effective cross-modal fusion. In addition, for the decoding stage, a cross-level feature fusion module that introduces global context features into the up-sampling process, reduces the impact of salient objects being swallowed by the background, and helps to accurately detect salient areas is proposed. Three different branch features are used for simultaneous end-to-end training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other methods in terms of multiple evaluation metrics on four datasets. Furthermore, the authors visualize the precision-recall curve, F-measure curve, and saliency map, which indicate that the detection effect of the proposed method is superior to those of other methods. During the testing stage, our model ran at 14 frames per second (FPS).

ID ROBUSTNESS
AB Existing research shows that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and c-MADRL is increasingly being applied to safety-critical domains. However, the robustness of c-MADRL against adversarial attacks has not been fully studied. In the setting of c-MADRL, unlike the single-agent scenario, an adversary can attack multiple agents or all agents at each time step, but the attacker needs more computation to generate adversarial examples and will be more easily detected. Therefore, how the attacker chooses one or several agents instead of all agents to attack is a significant issue in the setting of c-MADRL. Aiming to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel adversarial attack approach, which dynamically groups the agents according to relevant features and selects a group to attack based on the group's contribution to the overall reward, thus effectively reducing the cost and number of attacks, as well as improving attack efficiency and decreasing the chance of attackers being detected. Moreover, we exploit the transferability of adversarial examples to greatly reduce the computational cost of generating adversarial examples. Our method is tested in multi-agent particle environments (MPE) and in StarCraft II. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively degrade the performance of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithms with fewer attacks and lower computational costs.

AB In the field of evolutionary robotics, choosing the correct genetic representation is a complicated and delicate matter, especially when robots evolve behaviour and morphology at the same time. One principal problem is the lack of methods or tools to investigate and compare representations. In this paper we introduce and evaluate such a tool based on the biological notion of heritability. Heritability captures the proportion of phenotypic variation caused by genotypic variation and is often used to better understand the transmissibility of traits in real biological systems. As a proof of concept, we compare the heritability of various robot traits in two systems, one using a direct (tree based) representation and one using an indirect (grammar based) representation. We measure changes in heritability during the course of evolution and investigate how direct and indirect representation can be biased towards more exploration or exploitation throughout the course of evolution. The empirical study shows that heritability can be a useful tool to analyze different representations without running complete evolutionary processes using them.

AB Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment, as with all types of cancer. The pap-smear test is considered the gold standard for diagnosing cervical cancer. However, the success of diagnosis depends on the expertise and effort of the physician, as with all cancer types. Computer-aided diagnosis systems aim to improve the speed and accuracy of cancer diagnosis by constantly improving medical image analysis and diagnosis. One of the main challenges in classifying cervical cancer with deep learning-based methods is the availability and quality of data, as well as the variability in size, shape, and appearance of cervical cancer images. This study presents effective techniques for overcoming these challenges and developing a more efficient diagnostic system. Specifically, the study applies the latest and most powerful deep learning techniques in two categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches and vision transformer (ViT) approaches. The study also utilizes data augmentation techniques to increase data diversity and ensemble learning techniques to improve the accuracy of model outputs. This study presents a detailed comparison and the most extensive study in the literature by applying 40 CNN-based models and more than 20 ViT-based models on SIPaKMeD pap-smear dataset. The experimental results show that the latest ViT-based models perform better, and the existing CNN models perform similarly to the ViT models. By utilizing data augmentation and ensemble learning techniques in ViT-based models, the research exceeds previous studies and attains a level of success that has potential to be implemented in clinical settings. This progress is expected to bring down the mortality rate by enabling the early and precise identification of cancer.

AB A deep neural network is utilized to classify the parameters of a natural convection heat transfer of a nano-encapsulated phase change material suspension using the isotherm images for the first time. A natural convection flow and heat transfer simulation dataset were created and used as a training and validation tool. Then, a deep neural network, consisting of three parts, was used for the classification task. The first part was made of several conventional layers, and a rectified linear unit activation layer supported each layer. The second part was a preparation layer for reshaping from 2D images to 1D classification. The third layer was made of a classifier layer. The results showed that the impact of the Rayleigh number and volume concentrations of nanoparticles could be classified by 99.8 and 93.32% accuracy, respectively. However, the Stefan number was classified weakly. As a part of the current research, a transfer learning approach was used to improve accuracy. The learning transfer approach was quite effective and improved the accuracy of the Stefan number classification by 16.6%.

AB Data-free quantization compresses the neural network to low bit-width without access to original training data. Most existing data-free quantization methods cause severe performance degradation due to inaccurate activation clipping range and quantization error. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective data-free quantization method with accurate activation clipping and adaptive batch normalization. Accurate activation clipping (AAC) improves the model accuracy by exploiting accurate activation information from the full-precision model. Adaptive batch normalization (ABN) firstly proposes to address the quantization error from distribution changes by updating the batch normalization layer adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed data-free quantization method can yield surprising performance, achieving 64.33% top-1 accuracy of 4-bit ResNet18 on ImageNet dataset, with 3.7% absolute improvement outperforming the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB Radio-frequency fingerprinting is a technique for the authentication and identification of wireless devices using their intrinsic physical features and an analysis of the digitized signal collected during transmission. The technique is based on the fact that the unique physical features of the devices generate discriminating features in the transmitted signal, which can then be analyzed using signal-processing and machine-learning algorithms. Deep learning and more specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to the problem of radio-frequency fingerprinting using a spectral domain representation of the signal. A potential problem is the large size of the data to be processed, because this size impacts on the processing time during the application of the CNN. We propose an approach to addressing this problem, based on dimensionality reduction using feature-selection algorithms before the spectrum domain representation is given as an input to the CNN. The approach is applied to two public data sets of radio-frequency devices using different feature-selection algorithms for different values of the signal-to-noise ratio. The results show that the approach is able to achieve not only a shorter processing time; it also provides a superior classification performance in comparison to the direct application of CNNs.

AB The predictive methods of tool wear are usually based on different algorithm predictors, different source data, and different sensing devices for remaining useful life (RUL). In general, it has challenges to model and ensure all of the cutting conditions that are suitable in the actual cutting process for sustainable manufacturing. In order to overcome the doing large amount of experimental data and predict different tool RULs, this study combines the analytical force modeling, the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) machine learning, and the current sensor which all are integrated in smart machine box (SMB) to realize the practical RUL prediction for on-line and real-time applications. The analytical model of the cutting force coefficients of shear and ploughing was established from average cutting forces, it could reduce the experimental number and predict the different cutting conditions. In general, the loading current of the cutting tool from a spindle motor is relatively easier acquired than the resultant forces. Thus, the loading currents of the spindle are used to train and predict the cutting forces using the BPNN model during intelligent manufacturing. The SMB architecture mainly performed the autonomous actions based on the edge layer, the fog layer, and the cloud layer via the TCP/IP, the MQTT protocol, and the unified communication library. Results showed that a predictive error for the ends of the tool life is about 3-10% that are based on the calculating of the cumulative current ratio.

ID DIAGNOSIS; MODEL
AB Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a key role in preventing and responding to this neurodegenerative disease. It has shown that, compared with a single imaging modality-based classification of AD, synergy exploration among multimodal neuroimages is beneficial for the pathological identification. However, effectively exploiting multimodal information is still a big challenge due to the lack of efficient fusion methods. Herein, a multimodal fusion network based on attention mechanism is proposed, in which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission computed tomography (PET) images are converted into feature vectors with the same dimension, while the demographic information and clinical data are preprocessed and converted into feature vectors through embedding. This attention model can focus on important feature points, fuse the multimodal information more effectively, and thus provide accurate diagnosis and prediction for different pathological stages. The results show that the model achieves an accuracy of 84.1% for triple classification tasks in normal cognition (NC) versus mild cognitive impairment (MCI) versus AD and 93.9% prediction accuracy in stable MCI (sMCI) versus progressive MCI (pMCI). In contrast to the existing multimodal diagnosis methods, our model yields a state-of-the-art accuracy of AD diagnosis, which is powerful and promising in clinical practice.

AB Accurate segmentation of hard exudates in early non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy can assist physicians in taking appropriate treatment in a more targeted manner, in order to avoid more serious damage to vision caused by the deterioration of the disease in the later stages. Here, an Adaptive Learning Unet-based adversarial network with Convolutional neural network and Transformer (CT-ALUnet) is proposed for automatic segmentation of hard exudates, combining the excellent local modelling ability of Unet with the global attention mechanism of transformer. Firstly, multi-scale features are extracted through a CNN dual-branch encoder. Then, the information fusion of features at adjacent scale is realized and the fused features are selected adaptively to maintain the overall consistency of features by attention-guided multi-scale fusion blocks (AGMFB). After that, the high-level encoded features are input to transformer blocks to extract global contexts. Finally, these features are fused layer-by-layer to achieve accurate segmentation of hard exudates. In addition, adversarial training is incorporated into the above segmentation model, which improves Dice scores and MIoU scores by 7.5% and 3%, respectively. Experiments demonstrate that CT-ALUnet shows more reliable segmentation and stronger generalization ability than other SOTA methods, which lays a good foundation for computer-assisted diagnosis and assessment of efficacy.

ID REDUCTION; MODEL
AB Optimal scale selection (OSS) is a fundamental topic in the studies of multi-scale decision tables (MSDTs). Multi-scale set-valued decision tables (MSSVDTs) widely exist in practical applications, and the attribute value is a linguistic set-value. Existing studies of OSS in the MSDT with cost-sensitive learning have constructed total cost mainly from two aspects: test cost and delay cost. Moreover, they are given subjectively, resulting in a lack of objectivity in the construction of total cost. Therefore, constructing a relatively objective and comprehensive total cost for OSS based on cost-sensitive learning is worthwhile in MSSVDTs. In this paper, we firstly propose a quantization method to reasonably transform the linguistic set-value into a numerical value according to the granular structures. Then, based on three-way decisions with decision-theoretic rough sets, loss functions of every object on different scales are constructed, and uncertainty is quantified. Afterwards, loss functions are introduced into the construction of total cost with regard to OSS. This helps us obtain relatively objective total cost, including test cost, delay cost, and misclassification cost. Furthermore, in light of the idea of Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to an Ideal Solution, we design an OSS algorithm to select the optimal scale according to the ordered change of uncertainty and total cost. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are verified through experiments on UCI data sets.

ID SYSTEMS; DESIGN
AB Disturbance observer-based control method has achieved good results in the car-following scenario of intelligent and connected vehicle (ICV). However, the gain of conventional extended disturbance observer (EDO)-based control method is usually set manually rather than adjusted adaptively according to real time traffic conditions, thus declining the car-following performance. To solve this problem, a car-following strategy of ICV using EDO adjusted by reinforcement learning is proposed. Different from the conventional method, the gain of proposed strategy can be adjusted by reinforcement learning to improve its estimation accuracy. Since the "equivalent disturbance" can be compensated by EDO to a great extent, the disturbance rejection ability of the car-following method will be improved significantly. Both Lyapunov approach and numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Chest computed tomography (CT) can help early reveal abnormalities indicative of lung disease. Thus, accurate and automatic localisation of lung lesions is particularly important to assist physicians in rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The authors propose a classifier-augmented generative adversarial network framework for weakly supervised COVID-19 lung lesion localisation. It consists of an abnormality map generator, discriminator and classifier. The generator aims to produce the abnormality feature map M to locate lesion regions and then constructs images of the pseudo-healthy subjects by adding M to the input patient images. Besides constraining the generated images of healthy subjects with real distribution by the discriminator, a pre-trained classifier is introduced to enhance the generated images of healthy subjects to possess similar feature representations with real healthy people in terms of high-level semantic features. Moreover, an attention gate is employed in the generator to reduce the noise effect in the irrelevant regions of M. Experimental results on the COVID-19 CT dataset show that the method is effective in capturing more lesion areas and generating less noise in unrelated areas, and it has significant advantages in terms of quantitative and qualitative results over existing methods.

AB Offshore wind turbines play a vital role in transferring wind energy to electricity, which could help relieve the energy crisis and improve the global climate. In general, offshore wind turbines are installed open sea to avoid the potential interruption of people's daily life. In such kind of harsh operating environment, the wind turbine transmission system is prone to failure, especially for the rolling bearings. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct condition monitoring of rolling bearings to ensure the safe and efficient operation of offshore wind turbines. Intelligent fault diagnosis is a research hotspot for condition monitoring of rolling bearings. However, the existing intelligent fault diagnosis techniques have some limitations. For example, most of the existing techniques were developed based on single sensory data, which can lead to inaccurate and unstable diagnostic results. Moreover, most existing techniques implicitly assume that there are sufficient labeled samples for classifier training. This may not be the case for offshore wind turbines where the labeled samples are limited. To address the aforementioned issues, an intelligent fault diagnosis technique by integrating an information stream fusion and a semi-supervised learning approach is proposed in this study. In the proposed method, a coupled convolutional residual network is proposed to realize the information streams fusion, in which the vibration signal and acoustic emission signal are served as the inputs of the proposed network, and then a concatenation operation is used to fuse the features obtained from two information streams. Meanwhile, a semi-supervised learning approach is also proposed, which can utilize the labeled samples, the correctly predicted samples, and the unlabeled samples to improve diagnostic accuracy. The diagnostic result on the experimental offshore wind turbine bearing dataset demonstrates that the proposed method achieves the highest diagnostic accuracy compared to existing comparative methods.

AB This work presents several new and efficient algorithms that can be used by negotiating agents to explore very large outcome spaces. The proposed algorithms can search for bids close to a utility target or above a utility threshold, and for win-win outcomes. While doing so, these algorithms strike a careful balance between being rapid, accurate, diverse, and scalable, allowing agents to explore spaces with as many as 10(250) possible outcomes on very run-of-the-mill hardware. We show that our methods can be used to respond to the most common search queries employed by 87% of all agents from the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition between 2010 and 2021. Furthermore, we integrate our techniques into negotiation platform GeniusWeb in order to enable existing state-of-the-art agents (and future agents) to handle very large outcome spaces.

AB Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs due to insufficient level of dopamine in the human brain. This disease may occur predominantly in elder people. There exists no definite procedure to diagnose PD. It is diagnosed based on the symptoms, clinical trials, and number of laboratory tests. In this research paper, machine learning techniques are used to predict PD and help the medical practitioner to recommend personalized drugs for the patients. In this research paper, appropriate features are selected through rough set theory, and principal component analysis is used for dimensionality reduction. The performance is experimented using deep neural network, random forest, and SVM classifiers. The efficiency of the proposed approach is measured through confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall.

AB Decision trees (DT) are highly famous in machine learning and usually acquire state-of-the-art performance. Despite that, well-known variants like CART, ID3, random forest, and boosted trees miss a probabilistic version that encodes prior assumptions about tree structures and shares statistical strength between node parameters. Existing work on Bayesian DT depends on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which can be computationally slow, especially on high dimensional data and expensive proposals. In this study, we propose a method to parallelise a single MCMC DT chain on an average laptop or personal computer that enables us to reduce its run-time through multi-core processing while the results are statistically identical to conventional sequential implementation. We also calculate the theoretical and practical reduction in run time, which can be obtained utilising our method on multi-processor architectures. Experiments showed that we could achieve 18 times faster running time provided that the serial and the parallel implementation are statistically identical.

AB The rotation characteristics of point clouds are challenging to capture in current multimodal fusion methods for 3D object detection. A single fusion method cannot well balance the accuracy and speed in object detection. Therefore, a multi-sensor segmental fusion of frustum is proposed for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. A monocular camera, lidar, and radar are used for piecewise distributed feature-level fusion through frustum association. Firstly, a fully convolutional network is used to obtain a 2D detection frame and a center point of an object from an image. Frustum is generated according to the depth and scale information in a 3D space. Secondly, region of interest in the lidar and radar point clouds is determined by using the frustum association method. Then, spherical voxelization and spherical voxel convolution are performed on the lidar point cloud while extracting the rotation-invariant feature. Finally, feature-level fusion is performed with object attributes extracted from an image and the radar point cloud to improve the detection results. Meanwhile, a dynamic adaptive neural network of parameters for feature fusion is proposed, and it quickly obtains fusion features and ensures the accuracy of fusion results. The proposed method is both compared with other algorithms on the nuScenes dataset and tested on a severe weather dataset Radiate and in a real scenario. The proposed method has achieved the highest NDS score and the highest average accuracy in severe weather compared with other advanced methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method has higher accuracy and more excellent adaptability in various complex and severe weather driving environments.

AB Addressing for the consensus control of multiagent system (MAS) under the conditions that the directed communication topologies are switching and system nonlinearities are completely unknown, a global consensus control with fully distributed manner is proposed combining with fuzzy logic systems (FLSs). FLSs are used to approximate the unknown disturbances to enhance system robustness. To deal with the switching topologies of MAS, a reconstructing mechanism using a novel piecewise differentiable function is first proposed for the state and consensus errors of agents, which renders the state and consensus errors zero at each switching time instant and facilitates to the control design based on barrier functions, against the unexpected controller action at switching time instant. Incorporating with this reconstructing mechanism, a novel distributed controllers is designed, which is featured with low-complexity structure, fully distributed manner, and adaptively reconstructing ability. These technical attempts contribute to some new results. First, the global consensus of MAS with switching directed topologies and unknown nonlinearities is first achieved. Second, the consensus errors can be explicitly regulated to a prespecified arbitrary small residual set in the sense that the range of the set is the predefined functions given by designer. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the claims.

ID MULTIOBJECT TRACKING; LIDAR
AB Autonomous vehicles require constant environmental perception to obtain the distribution of obstacles to achieve safe driving. Specifically, 3D object detection is a vital functional module as it can simultaneously predict surrounding objects' categories, locations, and sizes. Generally, autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple sensors, including cameras and LiDARs. The fact that single-modal methods suffer from unsatisfactory detection performance motivates utilizing multiple modalities as inputs to compensate for single sensor faults. Although many multi-modal fusion detection algorithms exist, there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depth analysis of these methods to clarify how to fuse multi-modal data effectively. Therefore, this paper surveys recent advancements in fusion detection methods. First, we present the broad background of multi-modal 3D object detection and identify the characteristics of widely used datasets along with their evaluation metrics. Second, instead of the traditional classification method of early, middle, and late fusion, we categorize and analyze all fusion methods from three aspects: feature representation, alignment, and fusion, which reveals how these fusion methods are implemented in an essential way. Third, we provide an in-depth comparison of their pros and cons and compare their performance in mainstream datasets. Finally, we further summarize current challenges and research trends for realizing the full potential of multi-modal 3D object detection.

AB Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in effectively representing graph structured data because of their good performance and generalization ability. However, explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph of the node being explained. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in comparison to the existing explanation methods.

DE Graph machine learning; heterogeneous graph; graph represent learning;
   graph neural networks; metapath
AB The attention mechanism enables graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the attention weights between the target node and its one-hop neighbors, thereby improving the performance further. However, most existing GNNs are oriented toward homogeneous graphs, and in which each layer can only aggregate the information of one-hop neighbors. Stacking multilayer networks introduces considerable noise and easily leads to over smoothing. We propose here a multihop heterogeneous neighborhood information fusion graph representation learning method (MHNF). Specifically, we propose a hybrid metapath autonomous extraction model to efficiently extract multihop hybrid neighbors. Then, we formulate a hop-level heterogeneous information aggregation model, which selectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same hybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF) is constructed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and different-path neighborhood information. In this fashion, this paper solves the problem of aggregating multihop neighborhood information and learning hybrid metapaths for target tasks. This mitigates the limitation of manually specifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node information of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information present at different levels. Experimental results on real datasets show that MHNF achieves the best or competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines with only a fraction of 1/10 similar to 1/100 parameters and computational budgets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/MHNF.

TI Sparse Tensor-Based Multiscale Representation for Point Cloud Geometry

AB This study develops a unified Point Cloud Geometry (PCG) compression method through the processing of multiscale sparse tensor-based voxelized PCG. We call this compression method SparsePCGC. The proposed SparsePCGC is a low complexity solution because it only performs the convolutions on sparsely-distributed Most-Probable Positively-Occupied Voxels (MP-POV). The multiscale representation also allows us to compress scale-wise MP-POVs by exploiting cross-scale and same-scale correlations extensively and flexibly. The overall compression efficiency highly depends on the accuracy of estimated occupancy probability for each MP-POV. Thus, we first design the Sparse Convolution-based Neural Network (SparseCNN) which stacks sparse convolutions and voxel sampling to best characterize and embed spatial correlations. We then develop the SparseCNN-based Occupancy Probability Approximation (SOPA) model to estimate the occupancy probability either in a single-stage manner only using the cross-scale correlation, or in a multi-stage manner by exploiting stage-wise correlation among same-scale neighbors. Besides, we also suggest the SparseCNN based Local Neighborhood Embedding (SLNE) to aggregate local variations as spatial priors in feature attribute to improve the SOPA. Our unified approach not only shows state-of-the-art performance in both lossless and lossy compression modes across a variety of datasets including the dense object PCGs (8iVFB, Owlii, MUVB) and sparse LiDAR PCGs (KITTI, Ford) when compared with standardized MPEG G-PCC and other prevalent learning-based schemes, but also has low complexity which is attractive to practical applications.

AB We present two algorithms in the quantum CONGEST-CLIQUE model of distributed computation that succeed with high probability: one for producing an approximately optimal Steiner tree, and one for producing an exact directed minimum spanning tree, each of which uses (O) over tilde (n(1/)4) rounds of communication and (O) over tilde (n(9/4)) messages, achieving a lower asymptotic round and message complexity than any known algorithms in the classical CONGEST-CLIQUE model. At a high level, we achieve these results by combining classical algorithmic frameworks with quantum subroutines. Additionally, we characterize the constants and logarithmic factors involved in our algorithms as well as related classical algorithms, otherwise obscured by (O) over tilde notation, revealing that advances are needed to render both the quantum and classical algorithms practical.

TI Weakly-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition Using
   Physiological Signals
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep multiple instance learning; emotion recognition; physiological
   signals; temporal ambiguity; weakly-supervised learning
AB Instead of predicting just one emotion for one activity (e.g., video watching), fine-grained emotion recognition enables more temporally precise recognition. Previous works on fine-grained emotion recognition require segment-by-segment, fine-grained emotion labels to train the recognition algorithm. However, experiments to collect these labels are costly and time-consuming compared with only collecting one emotion label after the user watched that stimulus (i.e., the post-stimuli emotion labels). To recognize emotions at a finer granularity level when trained with only post-stimuli labels, we propose an emotion recognition algorithm based on Deep Multiple Instance Learning (EDMIL) using physiological signals. EDMIL recognizes fine-grained valence and arousal (V-A) labels by identifying which instances represent the post-stimuli V-A annotated by users after watching the videos. Instead of fully-supervised training, the instances are weakly-supervised by the post-stimuli labels in the training stage. The V-A of instances are estimated by the instance gains, which indicate the probability of instances to predict the post-stimuli labels. We tested EDMIL on three different datasets, CASE, MERCA and CEAP-360VR, collected in three different environments: desktop, mobile and HMD-based Virtual Reality, respectively. Recognition results validated with the fine-grained V-A self-reports show that for subject-independent 3-class classification (high/neutral/low), EDMIL obtains promising recognition accuracies: 75.63% and 79.73% for V-A on CASE, 70.51% and 67.62% for V-A on MERCA and 65.04% and 67.05% for V-A on CEAP-360VR. Our ablation study shows that all components of EDMIL contribute to both the classification and regression tasks. Our experiments also show that (1) compared with fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning can reduce the problem of overfitting caused by the temporal mismatch between fine-grained annotations and physiological signals, (2) instance segment lengths between 1-2 s result in the highest recognition accuracies and (3) EDMIL performs best if post-stimuli annotations consist of less than 30% or more than 60% of the entire video watching.

AB The clustering method has been widely used in data mining, pattern recognition, and image identification. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a soft clustering method that introduces the concept of membership. In this method, the fuzzy membership matrix is obtained by calculating the distance between data points in the original space. However, these methods may yield suboptimal results owing to the influence of redundant features. Moreover, FCM is always sensitive to noise points and heavily subject to outliers. In this article, we propose a method called sparsity FCM clustering with principal component analysis embedding (P_SFCM). We simultaneously conduct principal component analysis and membership learning, and then add an additional weighting factor for each data point. The goal of this operation is to identify the noise or outliers. Overall, the benefit of our framework is that it retains most of the information in the subspace while improving the robustness of the noise. In this article, we employ an iterative optimization algorithm to efficiently solve our model. To verify the reliability of the proposed method, we conduct a convergence analysis, noise robustness analysis, and multicluster experiments. Furthermore, comparative experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the P_SFCM is competitive with comparable methods.

ID INFORMATION
AB Fuzzy C-means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm based on partition of the universe. However, the partition generated by an equivalence relation is strict in practical application and exhibits relatively poor fault-tolerant mechanism. In this article, a novel binary relation based on improved FCM with the principle of refined justifiable granularity is presented. Different expressions of the proposed binary relation under different values of weight parameter are discussed, and the changes of the properties of the binary relation under different parameter values are provided. By measuring the significance of attributes in the feature space, a feature selection method, called forward heuristic feature selection (FHFS), is designed to construct the low-dimension feature space based on maximizing the original data and information retention through the defined degrees of aggregation and dispersion. It is shown how the results of feature selection and classification performance vary when the values of the weight factor locate in different ranges. To illustrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed FHFS algorithm, nine high-dimensional datasets and eight image datasets from University of California-Irvine (UCI) repository are used and compared with other feature selection methods, respectively. The results of experimental evaluation and the significance test show that the proposed learning mechanism is a superior algorithm.

AB In this article, we propose a concise fuzzy neural control framework for waverider vehicles with input constraints, while the spurred prescribed performance can be guaranteed, and the challenging fragility problem associated with the existing prescribed performance control (PPC) is avoided. Unlike the existing control protocols without considering computational costs, in this study, the low-complexity fuzzy neural approximation is combined with simple performance functions, which reduces the complexity burden and improves the practicability. Then, in order to handle the adverse effect of the actuator saturation on the control performance, bounded-input-bounded-state stable systems are developed to stabilize the closed-loop control system based on bounded compensations. Specially, flexible adjustment terms are exploited to modify the developed simple performance functions, while fragility-free prescribed performance is achieved for tracking errors, and moreover the fragility defect of the existing PPC is remedied. Finally, the efficiency and superiority of the design are verified via compared simulations.

ID MODEL
AB Consistency and consensus study for group decision making (GDM) with fuzzy preference relations (FPRs) are necessary, which have a decisive impact on the quality of decision results. Consistency can prevent self-contradictory judgments, and consensus limits the deviation among individual judgments within the preset threshold. Because acceptably multiplicative consistency still cannot avoid self-contradictory judgments, this article considers the ordinal consistency and acceptably multiplicative consistency simultaneously. In view of these aspects, we introduce a new optimal model-based method for GDM with FPRs. As minimum total adjustment and minimum individual adjustment may be inconsistent, we introduce the Solidarity consistency and consensus adjustment mechanism to allocate the minimum total adjustment, which fully considers the cooperation and solidarity among decision makers. When the So-CCAM does not exhibit stability, we present the nucleolus CCAM, which is the best element in the core according to lexicographical order. After that, an algorithm is offered. To demonstrate the application and efficiency of the new method, an illustrative example is offered, and a comparison is carried out. It offers the first optimization models-based method for GDM with FPRs in view of ordinal consistency, acceptably multiplicative consistency, and consensus analysis. Further, it provides two rational consistency and CCAMs by cooperative game theory.

AB Fuzzy clustering is an essential algorithm in image segmentation, and most of them are based on fuzzy c-mean algorithms. However, it is sensitive to noise, center point selection, cluster number, and distance metric. To address this problem, we propose a new fuzzy clustering method based on low-rank representation (LRR) for image segmentation, which integrates low-rank structure with fuzzy theory. First, we improve the morphological reconstruction superpixel method based on edge detection by introducing anisotropy to enhance the image edge. Thus, on the one hand, the improved morphological reconstruction superpixel method can improve its noise-resistance performance; on the other hand, the complexity of the subsequent low-rank computation can be reduced by enhancing the superpixels constructed by the edges. Second, inspired by the fact that rank can represent correlation, we propose the concept of fuzzy low-rank structure, which is not dealing with data directly but with the relationship between data. Specifically, we perform rank minimization on the constructed membership matrix to obtain the optimal matrix. To obtain better clustering results, we added the Frobenius norm of the fuzzy matrix as a fuzzy regularization term in the LRR model to achieve global convergence and obtain a membership matrix with a strong element correlation. Finally, we obtain the final clustering results by clustering the processed membership matrix using a subspace clustering with a low-rank structure constraint. Experiments performed on artificial and real-world images show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the current state-of-the-art methods.

AB A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus, there are hardly any work dealing with datasets having features more than hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle datasets with even more than 7000 features! In this context, we propose an adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of "numeric underflow" and "fake minimum" that arise for existing fuzzy systems while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an adaptive Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design an enhanced fuzzy rule base, which maintains adequate rules but does not grow the number of rules exponentially with features that typically happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated feature selection and rule extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: 1) feature selection; 2) rule extraction; and 3) fine tuning. The effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five are in more than 2000 dimension including two with more than 7000 features. This may be the first attempt to develop fuzzy rule-based classifiers that can directly deal with more than 7000 features without requiring separate selection of features or any other dimensionality reduction method.

AB For time-varying delayed nonlinear systems with parameter uncertainties and persistent disturbances, an online and an offline robust fuzzy model predictive control algorithms are proposed in this article. Both methods guarantee the input-to-state stability of the system. Furthermore, a novel alternative optimization (AOP) approach and a dual-mode optimal control (OP)/AOP strategy are proposed to prevent the performance deterioration of the online OP approach due to the challenges in addressing the bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) constraints. With the established AOP and dual-mode OP/AOP techniques, the optimization problem constrained by BMIs is transformed into convex, and a significantly more precise approximation of the ellipsoidal minimal robust positively invariant set can be calculated. Besides, the system can eventually converge into a more compact ellipsoidal set. These two alternative optimization methods can be easily extended to various nonlinear systems. A numerical example and a continuous-time stirring tank example are provided to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the established methodologies.

AB A real system may go through several states ranging from full performance to complete failure, carrying out infinite partial performances during service time. This article portrays such a nonbinary state of systems via the fuzzy membership function. Then, the relation between the system reliability under the binary state and that under the fuzzy state is deduced, on which a multitype component allocation problem (MCAP) is investigated to search for the optimal permutation of different types of components to maximize the fuzzy system reliability. After that, we inherit the exploration ability of genetic algorithm (GA) and the exploitation ability of Birnbaum importance (BI) to propose a fuzzy-BI-based two-stage approach combined with GA in order to deal with the MCAP under fuzzy state assumption efficiently and accurately. The k-out-of-n systems in both low and high dimensions are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the similarity and difference between the MCAP under binary state and that under fuzzy state. The experimental results showcase that the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches for MCAP.

AB Fuzzy decision trees (FDTs) is one of the considerably excellent methods. Most of the existing FDTs' methods are oriented to classification tasks. Applying FDTs to regression tasks may solve complex industrial modeling problems. In this article, we propose the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy regression tree (TSFRT), which uses the hypothesis of "feature screening followed by T-S fuzzy reasoning." In the TSFRT, the growth process (crisp set theory) can be deemed as feature screening, and each leaf node (fuzzy set theory) is viewed as a T-S inference reasoning system. Thus, the TSFRT becomes a top-down structure. We develop multiple strategies to identify the parameters of the T-S system in the leaf node using sample-by-sample and batch samples. To improve the method's generalization performance, we also generalize an ensemble method with pseudoinverse and ridge regression. The proposed methods are evaluated by several high- and low-dimensional complex industrial processes. The experimental results show that the proposed method remarkably outperforms other popular regression methods.

AB This article proposes an interpretable fuzzy estimation system (IFES) for fast estimation of severity of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) using three easily available physiological variables: neck circumference, waist circumference, and average blood pressure after waking up. The IFES aims to decrease the waiting list of polysomnography so that OSAHS treatment can be performed as soon as possible. The IFES is optimized to achieve the following three objectives: high estimation accuracy, the largest number of applicable subjects, and high model interpretability. The applicable subjects are determined by evaluating the influence of six screening factors, such as smoking, hypertension, and sleep efficiency, on the estimation performance. This article finds solutions of this multiobjective optimization problem using a multiobjective genetic algorithm. A total of 1197 participants are enrolled with the five-fold cross-validation scheme employed to evaluate an estimation performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method successfully finds the influence of different screening factors and the found IFESs outperform different estimation models used for comparison.

AB Choquet integral is a widely used aggregation operator on 1-D and interval-valued information, since it is able to take into account the possible interaction among data. However, there are many cases where the information taken into account is vectorial, such as long short-term memories (LSTM). LSTM units are a kind of recurrent neural networks that have become one of the most powerful tools to deal with sequential information since they have the power of controlling the information flow. In this article, we first generalize the standard Choquet integral to admit an input composed by n-dimensional vectors, which produces an n-dimensional vector output. We study several properties and construction methods of vector Choquet integrals (VCIs). Then, we use this integral in the place of the summation operator, introducing in this way the new VCI-LSTM architecture. Finally, we use the proposed VCI-LSTM to deal with two problems: 1) sequential image classification; 2) text classification.

AB Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) are synergistic structures that aim to benefit from the properties of fuzzy logic in neural network structures. Yet, the traditional FNNs do not explicitly address the reliability aspect of uncertain real-world applications. Here we propose a reliable fuzzy neural networks (ReFNNs) in which an information reliability measure is employed for rule training and robust decision making of the uncertain input data. The universal approximation property of the proposed structure is proved using the Stone-Weierstrass theorem. Furthermore, the resulting structure is continuous and differentiable. Hence, a backpropagation training algorithm is developed to optimize the proposed ReFNN's parameters. Additionally, asymptotic stability analysis based on the Lyapunov theorem is shown for ReFNNs. Finally, this structure is first evaluated with several basic benchmark examples in function approximation (sine, increasing sinusoid, quadratic Hermite, and nonlinear functions). We then apply it to modeling several benchmark nonlinear systems (including a 3rd order nonlinear dynamical system, a continuous stirred tank reactor, a two-cascaded tank problem, a Wiener-Hammerstein system, and wind speed prediction) and the adaptive control of nonlinear systems in both direct and indirect frameworks. Results confirm the superiority of the proposed structure over traditional FNNs in terms of error and sensitivity in the presence of noise.

AB This article addresses dynamic authority allocation strategy and security-based resilient event-triggered output feedback lane keeping control (LKC) problem for human-machine cooperative steering intelligent heavy truck subject to nonperiodic energy bounded denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. For authority allocation strategy of considered LKC system, designed practical and easily-to-implement cooperative allocation factor (CAF) is adaptively adjusted by the correlation characteristics between buffered interested states for the first time. For derived fuzzy model of networked LKC system with time-varying CAF and path tracking velocity, a new security-based resilient event-triggered output feedback control with communication scheme consisting of adaptive adjusted auxiliary variable and attack-induced random but bounded uncertainty is proposed to reduce communication burden when free of attacks and simultaneously release necessary data for stability maintenance at the cost of predefined allowable control performance degradation when attack-induced uncertainty less than its upper bound. Furthermore, sufficient conditions are derived for exponentially stability of considered LKC system with H infinity performance, and gain matrices for controller and trigger are cdesigned and obtained by solving certain matrix inequalities. Benefiting from saved communication resource and more sparse but necessary assistant torque commands under resilient event-triggered communication scheme as well as dynamic authority allocation strategy with adaptive CAF, the obtained results illustrating fewer driving conflict, less driver effort, and higher resistant ability to attack-induced yaw instability demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Partial multilabel learning (PML) has attracted considerable interest from scholars. Most PML models construct objective functions and optimize target parameters, which add noise to the training process and results in a poor classification effect. In addition, feature correlation is limited to linear transformations while ignoring the complex relationships among features. In this study, we develop a novel PML model with fuzzy neighborhood-based ball clustering and kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). To reduce the interference from noise, ball k-means clustering is introduced to preprocess partial multilabel data and initialize ball clustering. A new ball clustering model based on fuzzy neighborhood is first designed to address partial multilabel systems. The particle-ball fusion strategy is developed to merge the particle balls reasonably, and the fuzzy membership function and label enhancement are studied for the subsequent training process. Then novel KELM with feature transformation matrix of training data is produced to analyze the nonlinear relationships among features. Finally, a nonsmooth convex objective function with the regression model is constructed to analyze the complex nonlinear relationships among features, and the optimal solutions of three objective parameters are solved by accelerated proximal gradient optimization. Experiments on 14 datasets reveal the effectiveness of the developed algorithm.

AB This study focuses on the adaptive fuzzy predefined-time attitude tracking control problem for rigid spacecraft with inertia uncertainties, external disturbances, and state constraints. In control design, fuzzy logic systems are adopted to approximate the unknown nonlinear dynamics, and a quadratic-fraction barrier Lyapunov function is introduced to ensure that the predefined state constraints are not violated. Compared with the existing dynamic surface control approaches, a novel predefined-time filter and an adaptive fuzzy predefined-time controller are presented, such that the filter error and attitude tracking error can converge to a small region in predefined time simultaneously, where the minimum upper bound of settling time can be exactly preset by tuning one control parameter. Comparative simulation results are carried out to verify the superiority and efficacy of the presented strategy.

AB While interpretable antecedent parts of first-order Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rules can be properly acquired by adopting some clustering methods, this study aims at avoiding the commonly used yet fully incomprehensive consequent parts and their intractable training, and simultaneously seeking for enhanced generalization performance by determining the weight of each rule. The central idea is to build a mathematically equivalent bridge between a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a fully interpretable first-order TSK fuzzy system called FIMG-TSK, with the help of Gaussian-mixture's mean. The resultant FIMG-TSK has a simple expected output expression without summation-to-one defuzzification, which will be helpful in inducing both smaller output variance and a negative entropic and rule-stability-based regularizer for enhancing the generalization performance. After revealing three factors affecting the output stability of FIMG-TSK, the negative entropic and rule-stability-based regularizer is designed through both these factors and the squared entropy to make the output variance of FIMG-TSK as small as possible. Accordingly, a novel training method, whose objective function takes the proposed regularizer as an additional term and hence compromises both accuracy and output stability of FIMG-TSK, is developed to quickly provide an analytical solution to the weight of each rule. The effectiveness of the proposed training method is manifested by the experimental results on ten regression datasets.

AB This article presents some theoretical considerations about the variance of a fuzzy set and introduces a covering-based algorithm for computing the bounds of the variance of an interval Type-2 fuzzy set. The proposed algorithm obtains the bounds of all possible variances of an interval Type-2 fuzzy set unlike other algorithms, which are based on the center of centroid of an interval Type-2 fuzzy set to obtain a relative variance that is proven to be always bigger than the absolute variance. A comparison to the relative variance of an interval Type-2 fuzzy set is given through different examples, where the proposed algorithm shows better precision than the KM algorithm.

AB This article focuses on the event-triggered (ET) fuzzy tracking control for uncertain state constrained strict-feedback systems with unknown control directions. A novel nonlinear transformed function is developed to transform the constrained system states into the counterpart without any constraints. An ingenious adaptation law is developed to co-design the control law and the ET rule, thereby effectively compensating the sampling error caused by the ET rule under unknown control directions. Based on the presented adaptation law and the Nussbaum gain technique, a novel ET fuzzy tracking control strategy is proposed, which can handle the situations with and without state constraints in a unified way without readjusting the control scheme. Subsequently, the nonlinear transformed function is extended to the time-varying state constraints, and the corresponding ET fuzzy control scheme is also modified to guarantee the closed-loop boundedness. The proposed two control strategies guarantee the satisfactory tracking performance, avoid the violation of the prescribed state constraints, and decrease the communication load effectively. Finally, the usefulness of the developed methods is verified through two simulation examples.

AB Fuzzy type-2 modeling techniques are increasingly being used to model uncertain dynamical systems. However, some challenges arise when applying the existing techniques. These are the following: 1) a large number of rules are required to complete cover the whole input space; 2) a large number of parameters associated with type-2 membership functions have to be determined; 3) the identified fuzzy model is usually difficult to interpret due to the large number of rules; and 4) designing a fuzzy type-2 controller using these models is a computationally expensive task. To overcome these limitations, a procedure is proposed here to identify the fuzzy type-2 model directly from the data. This model is called the distending-function-based fuzzy inference system (DFIS). This model consists of rules and interval type-2 distending functions. First, a few key rules are identified from the data, and later, more rules are added until the error is less than the threshold. The proposed procedure is used to model the altitude controller of a quadcopter. The performance of the DFIS model is compared with that of various fuzzy models. Furthermore, a simplified procedure based on the rules is presented to design a computationally low-cost type-2 controller. The effectiveness of the controller is shownby regulating the height of a quadcopter in the presence of noisy sensory data. The performance of this controller is compared with that of various other controllers. Finally, the proposed type-2 controller was implemented on a Parrot Mambo quadcopter to demonstrate its real-time performance.

AB The exponential stabilization of nonlinear distributed parameter systems (DPSs) with time-varying delay is studied in this article. With the employment of the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, the nonlinear DPSs are described as a fuzzy parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). Then, with the consideration of the measurement output and control input information quantized by a kind of dynamic quantizers, fuzzy static, and dynamic output feedback controllers are proposed. The time-delayed feedback controllers are also provided in the forms of static and dynamic. On the basis of the derived T-S fuzzy PDE model, Lyapunov-based control design strategies are proposed with respect to the effect of quantization. Moreover, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functionals, sufficient conditions for designing the output feedback control gains and the quantizers' adjusting parameters, which guarantee the exponential stability of the fuzzy closed-loop system are provided in terms of standard linear matrix inequalities. Finally, we explore the output feedback controllers into the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation and Fisher equation as applications. The efficiency of the design strategies is indicated through the simulation results.

AB This article presents a framework to enable a human and robot to perform collaborative tasks safely and efficiently. It consists of three functions. First, human motion is predicted by utilizing Gaussian mixture regression. Second, the motion planning of an online robot is performed such that the robot can appropriately react to a human coworker while executing a task. In our proposed framework, the predicted human motion is transferred to a virtual force acting on a robot's end effector. Its initial trajectory is modified so as to avoid any collisions with the human. To obtain a smooth, collision-free, and energy-minimized trajectory, a constrained optimization problem is formulated. A neural dynamics optimization algorithm is then adopted to solve it. Third, an adaptive fuzzy controller is proposed to track the robot's desired trajectory with uncertain dynamics parameters. We provide the rigorous proof of stability for the proposed methods. The physical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collaborative strategy.

AB This article deals with the problem of multiple-event-triggered dissipative tracking control for nonlinear Markov jump systems with incomplete transition probabilities. An interval type-2 fuzzy model with partially known transition probability matrix is used to capture the underlying nonlinearities and a hidden Markov model with an incomplete conditional probability matrix is employed to describe the possible asynchronous phenomenon between the plant and the tracking controller. A multiple-event-triggered methodology involving two adaptive event-triggered schemes for the actuator channel and the sensor channel is proposed. By using the Lyapunov and dissipativity theory, sufficient conditions for the desired tracking controller are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Last, two examples, involving one numerical and one practical model named the Henon system, are utilized to show the effectiveness of the proposed tracking control algorithm.

The self-adaptive convergence parameter is designed by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic system. Convergence and robustness of the proposed model are analyzed. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed model not only has less fixed convergence time than the recently suggested ZNN models, but also is noise-tolerant. Numerical experiments are performed to illustrate its efficiency and effectiveness as well as the superior performance over the existing ZNN models for solving the time-varying Sylvester equation, including the applicability of the proposed model to robot manipulator. The effects of model parameters on the dynamic response of the robotic manipulator system are also illustrated by the convergence rate of position errors of the robotic manipulator trajectory.

AB In this article, a generalized fuzzy subset (GFS) method is proposed to assess the time-varying multistate reliability of the perturbation failure coupling measurement system. First, a perturbation-failure coupling mechanism is designed to define the propagation chain of perturbations so as to integrate all the possible perturbations as the inputs of the GFS method. Second, to assess the time-varying multistate reliability, a GFS reliability model is constructed based on the composite limit state. Furthermore, the concept of the uncertain subset boundary is presented to conduct the reliability assessment via a group of embedded interval type-2 fuzzy sets. To address the deficiency of the GFS reliability model, a data-driven strategy is designed to establish the implicit relation between the limited expert knowledge and the membership function. Finally, the experimental tests are carried out to examine the superiority of the GFS method, and parametric studies are also conducted to study the reliability of the PFCM system.

AB There are several extensions of fuzzy sets. Hesitant fuzzy sets are one of them. They are defined in terms of a set of membership degrees. For a typical hesitant fuzzy set, this set of membership degrees has a finite number of values. One of the motivations to introduce score functions was to rank alternatives. In this case, as the membership degrees are a set, the comparison of membership values does not lead, in general, to a total order. Score functions can be seen as functions that transform the set of membership degrees into a single membership value. In this way, we can construct the total order. In this article, we propose a general framework to define score functions for hesitant fuzzy sets based on fuzzy integrals. This framework permits to see most relevant indices as particular cases. Moreover, previous approaches focused on typical hesitant fuzzy sets. Our approach is more general in the sense that we can process both typical hesitant fuzzy sets and the nontypical ones (with membership values that are not finite). We also frame the problem into a more general setting. That is, the problem of hesitant fuzzy set transformation. Score functions can be seen as functions that transform a hesitant fuzzy set into a standard fuzzy set. Similarly, we can consider its transformation to interval-valued fuzzy sets and type-2 fuzzy sets. Aggregation functions can also be used for the same purpose.

AB The linguistic information of decision makers (DMs) often implies individual preferences and behavioral traits. Reaching consensus in linguistic group decision making (GDM) requires understanding the overconfidence behaviors exhibited by DMs and implementing effective management. However, owing to the differences in individual expression and understanding, the management of the overconfidence behaviors of DMs must effectively handle heterogeneous preference information and personalized individual semantics (PIS). To solve this problem, this article manages overconfidence behaviors exhibited by DMs in linguistic GDM by considering PIS and multiple self-confidence levels. Specifically, DMs utilize flexible linguistic representation models to provide preference values over alternatives and corresponding self-confidence levels, thereby generating heterogeneous preference relations (HPRs) with self-confidence (PRs-SC). We then integrate HPRs into unified linguistic distribution expressions. In addition, we transform linguistic PRs-SC into additive PRs-SC using a PIS model. We detect and manage individuals' overconfidence behaviors to decrease the negatively impact of overconfidence on consensus efficiency and the decision quality. Subsequently, DMs' preference values and SC levels are utilized to generate modification suggestions to achieve a consensus. Finally, we use a loan selection on a peer-to-peer lending platform as an example to illustrate and demonstrate the usability, effectiveness, and feasibility of our model through a simulation and comparative analysis.

AB Bisimulations are established forms of behavioral equivalences for discrete event systems. Recently, bisimulations have been introduced to fuzzy transition systems (FTSs) and developed quickly. Relational lifting by using weight functions is one of the most used methods in bisimulation research, which lifts a crisp relation on the state spaces to a crisp relation on the distributions of state spaces of FTSs. This article proposes a method, called fuzzy relational lifting method, via fuzzy similarity measures induced by residua (implications) in complete residuated lattices. In contrast with the existing method, fuzzy relational lifting method relaxes the conditions of lifting relation by using weight functions and is a generalization of the method. Some properties of fuzzy lifting operation are presented. Based on the fuzzy lifting operation, a fuzzy bisimulation for nondeterministic fuzzy transition systems is introduced, which is much more natural and robust than some behavioral measures, and can measure the degree of similarity between any two states, which are deemed to be equivalent intuitively but simply distinguished by other behavioral measures. Then some properties of fuzzy bisimulations are provided. Moreover, a fixed-point characterization of fuzzy bisimulations is given and the greatest fuzzy bisimulation is computed. Finally, a real-valued logic is introduced to characterize fuzzy bisimulations over Godel algebra.

AB In a canonical particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the fitness is a widely accepted criterion when selecting exemplars for a particle, which exhibits promising performance in simple unimodal functions. To improve a PSO's performance on complicated multimodal functions, various selection strategies based on the fitness value are introduced in PSO community. However, the inherent defects of the fitness-based selections still remain. In this article, a novelty of a particle is treated as an additional criterion when choosing exemplars for a particle. In each generation, a few of elites and mavericks who have better fitness and novelty values are selected, and saved in two archives, respectively. Hence, in each generation, a particle randomly selects its own learning exemplars from the two archives, respectively. To strengthen a particle's adaptive capability, a multiple-input multiple-output fuzzy logic controller is used to adjust two parameters of the particle, i.e., an acceleration coefficient and a selection proportion of elites. The experimental results and comparisons between our new proposed PSO, named as MFCPSO in this article, and other six PSO variants on CEC2017 test suite with four different dimension cases suggest that MFCPSO exhibits very promising characteristics on different types of functions, especially on large scale complicated functions. Furthermore, the effectiveness and efficiency of the fuzzy controlled parameters are discussed based on extensive experiments.

AB Generally, fuzzy models, especially rule-based models, are designed in a monolithic manner, meaning that all data are used en bloc to design the model. At the same time, there is a visible need to cope with the ever-increasing volumes of data (both in terms of the number of data and their dimensionality) as well as being faced with distributed data located at various locations. The objective of this article is to develop a concept and provide a design framework as well as assess its performance for constructing a collection of rule-based models on a basis of a randomly sampled repository of data and then realize their aggregation. More specifically, for the sampled data, the design of each model is carried out in a standard way as commonly encountered in the case of Takagi-Sugeno (TS) rule-based models and next augmented by gradient boosting. The aggregation is realized by optimizing a weighting scheme applied to the results of the individual models. Our intent is also to carefully demonstrate the performance offered by the mechanisms of machine learning applied in the setting of rule-based models, which is an original task completed before. A number of high-dimensional data are used in the experimental studies to complete a thorough assessment. A comparative performance analysis is reported with respect to the monolithically developed TS models.

AB Exposure to massive information in daily lives makes it necessary for people to obtain major points efficiently, promoting the development of text summarization technology. However, existing sentiment-based text summarization methods only pay attention to the sentiment polarity of either a single sentence or a whole document, ignoring changes of sentiments along with sentences or sentiment flow across the whole document. To incorporate the above two aspects into the summarization process to generate high-quality summaries, we propose a topic sentiment summarization framework based on reaching definition (TSSRD). In the framework, we first use topic models to model documents and calculate topic sentiment embeddings. Then, we analyze document structures from different perspectives to design data flow diagrams, in which improved reaching definition is used to analyze sentiment changes and sentiment flow. Finally, topic sentiment summaries are generated based on sentiments in steady states of the reaching definition. To evaluate our summarization framework, we introduce an extrinsic evaluation method. In this method, a sentiment classifier is trained by the topic sentiment summaries, and accuracy of the sentiment classification is used as a quality score. Experimental results demonstrate that our summarization framework is at least 2.32% better than baselines on IMDb and Amazon datasets.

DE Aspect-based sentiment analysis; meta learning; self-training
AB Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) means to identify fine-grained aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.

AB Thanks to the breakthrough of large-scale pre-trained language model (PLM) technology, prompt-based classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis and emotion detection, have raised increasing attention. Such tasks are formalized as masked language prediction tasks which are in line with the pre-training objects of most language models. Thus, one can use a PLM to infer the masked words in a downstream task, then obtaining label predictions with manually defined label-word mapping templates. Prompt-based affective computing takes the advantages of both neural network modeling and explainable symbolic representations. However, there still remain many unclear issues related to the mechanisms of PLMs and prompt-based classification. We conduct a systematic empirical study on prompt-based sentiment analysis and emotion detection to study the biases of PLMs towards affective computing. We find that PLMs are biased in sentiment analysis and emotion detection tasks with respect to the number of label classes, emotional label-word selections, prompt templates and positions, and the word forms of emotion lexicons.

ID SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
AB Conversational sentiment analysis (CSA) and emotion-cause pair extraction (ECPE) tasks have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The former aims to predict the sentiment states of speakers in a conversation, and the latter is about extracting emotion-cause clauses in a document. However, one drawback of CSA is that it cannot model the causal reasoning among emotion and neutral utterances from different speakers. In this work, we propose a new task: emotion-cause pair extraction in conversations (ECPEC), which aims to extract pairs of emotional utterances and corresponding cause utterances in conversations. The utterance-level ECPEC task is more challenging since the distance between emotion and cause utterances is larger than that of the clause-level ECPE task. To this end, we build a novel dataset ConvECPE and propose a specifically designed two-step framework for the new ECPEC task. Experimental results on ConvECPE dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the ECPEC task as well as the effectiveness of our framework.

AB Metaverse is a novel innovative platform that connects users worldwide in the distributed virtual environment. People share their interests, opinions, and resources on this virtual reality platform. With this, we come to know that besides other fundamental techniques, the language generation method is also a necessity to regulate the VR environment. There are several types of language generation methods in 3D, including neural learning, such as GRU, RNN, and GPT-3, and transfer learning. This paper proposes a recurrent voting generator (RVG) system that understands the 3D text of a book and performs emotional analytics within a metaverse space. The proposed model RVG evaluates emotions through three algorithms such as the first module is a recurrent sentiment generator (RSG) that analyzes emotions and calculates and generates the distributions. The second module is the sentiment decomposition (SD) that optimizes higher dimensions in Big Data. And, the third module is the compound voting learning (CVL) module that performs calculations with an emphasis on optimal performance. The dataset used to evaluate RVG is based on the content of movie reviews and books. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed approach outperforms better compared to the existing 2D RNN models in the metaverse.

AB Recently, many efforts have been devoted to promoting the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task, as jointly extracting emotions and their causes is considered more helpful than only identifying the emotions in many applications. Among the existing efforts, end-to-end approaches are getting popular as the main trend, while others like pipeline models have been overlooked due to their potential issues of cascading errors. Nevertheless, the advantages of the pipeline models, such as logically dividing a complicated task into multiple easier subtasks, are underestimated and not well exploited. Moreover, the existing end-to-end approaches fail to capture the implicit co-occurrence or exclusion patterns between multiple pairs of emotions and causes since they are extracted independently. In view of these limitations, we propose a novel two-stage model to address the ECPE task and incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle the cascading error issue. In particular, our two-stage model first detects emotion clauses and then recognizes cause clauses for each detected emotion clause sequentially. By representing the error of each decision as an explicit reward, our model clearly knows how the error at each stage affects the final performance, hence the model can adjust itself for better performance. Furthermore, the sequential prediction enables our model to use the results achieved in the previous stages as auxiliary information in the subsequent stages. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed two-stage model, and the ablation comparison shows the promising effect of reducing cascading errors by incorporating RL.

AB Recent work in Natural Language Processing has increasingly focused on detecting suicidal intent in textual data, where the main aim is to detect expressions in a binary setting. However, previous research has shown that search results and other mentions of suicide online are not only limited to expressions of suicidal intent. Therefore, previously proposed algorithms and datasets might for example struggle to distinguish between suicidal intent of a user and suicide mentioned in a humorous context. In this article we introduce a new dataset called TWISCO, which proposes an alternative approach to classifying expressions of suicidality online. For this, we use a coding framework developed in Psychology to distinguish between different mentions of suicide. Next, we present a variety of machine and deep learning baselines in three different classification settings (text only, features only and text and features). Furthermore, we introduce a Feature GCN that improves performance over the GCN baseline. Finally, we investigate the hypothesis that feelings of dominance are correlated with users expressing their own suicidality. We provide an in-depth discussion of the trade-offs in classifying suicidal intent online.

ID NETWORK
AB Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) needs to detect the emotion of each utterance in conversations. However, it is difficult for machines to recognize the emotion of utterances like humans, partly because of the lack of commonsense knowledge. Despite existing efforts gradually incorporate knowledge in ERC, they can not adaptively adjust knowledge according to different utterances and their context. In this article, we propose a knowledge selection framework SKSEC (<bold>S</bold>elect <bold>K</bold>nowledge in light of <bold>S</bold>entiment <bold>E</bold>motion and <bold>C</bold>ontext). In the SKSEC framework, first, external knowledge is eliminated by three Knowledge Elimination (KE) modules. More concretely, In word-level KE, the concept knowledge different from the sentiment corresponding to the word in utterances is randomly eliminated. In utterance- or context-level KE, If the similarity between the knowledge representation and the emotion label representation of the current utterance or its context is less than the preset threshold, the knowledge will be eliminated. Then we refine the weight of knowledge using two Graph ATtention (GAT) mechanisms. Specifically, In Sentics GAT, we employ a dimensional emotion model to measure words in utterances and their corresponding knowledge and adjust the weight of knowledge according to their emotional similarity. In Semantics GAT, the weight of knowledge is adjusted according to the semantic similarity between context and incorporated knowledge. Finally, we feed the selected knowledge to the most advanced models to evaluate the quality of knowledge. The experimental results show that the SKSEC framework can effectively improve the performance of the model by eliminating and refining external knowledge in different size and domain datasets.

AB Visual sentiment analysis is a challenging problem. Many datasets and approaches have been designed to foster breakthroughs in this trending research topic. However, most works scrutinize only subsymbolic models through visual attributes of the evaluated images, paying less attention to the subjectivity of viewers' perceptions as a basis for neuro-symbolic systems. Aiming to fill this gap, we present PerceptSent, a novel dataset for visual sentiment analysis that spans 5,000 images shared by users on social networks. Besides the sentiment opinion (positive, slightly positive, neutral, slightly negative, negative) expressed by every evaluator about each image analyzed, the dataset contains evaluator's metadata (age, gender, socioeconomic status, education, and psychological hints) as well as perceptions observed by the evaluator about the image - such as the presence of nature, violence, lack of maintenance, etc. Deep architectures and different problem formulations are explored using our dataset to combine visual and extra attributes (external knowledge) for automatic sentiment analysis. We show evidence that evaluator's perceptionss, when correctly employed, are crucial in visual sentiment analysis, improving the F-score performance from 61% to an impressive rate above 97%. Although, at this point, we do not have automatic approaches to capture these perceptions, our results open up new investigation avenues.

AB Conversation is an important form of human communication and contains a large number of emotions. It is interesting to discover emotions and their causes in conversations. Conversation in its natural form is multimodal. Many studies have been carried out on multimodal emotion recognition in conversations, yet there is still a lack of work on multimodal emotion cause analysis. In this article, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations, aiming to jointly extract emotions and the corresponding causes from conversations reflected in multiple modalities (i.e., text, audio and video). We accordingly construct a multimodal conversational emotion cause dataset, Emotion-Cause-in-Friends, which contains 9,794 multimodal emotion-cause pairs among 13,619 utterances in the Friends sitcom. We benchmark the task by establishing two baseline systems including a heuristic approach considering inherent patterns in the location of causes and emotions and a deep learning approach that incorporates multimodal features for emotion-cause pair extraction, and conduct the human performance test for comparison. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of multimodal information, explore the potential of incorporating commonsense knowledge, and perform the task under both Static and Real-time settings.

AB Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has wide applications in medical care, human-computer interaction, and other fields. Unlike the general task of emotion analysis, humans usually rely on context and commonsense knowledge to convey emotions in conversations. Only when the model can connect and fully utilize a large-scale commonsense knowledge base, it can better understand latent contents in conversations. Unfortunately, there is no available knowledge selection mechanism to address such knowledge needs and to make sure the system is not flooded with irrelevant commonsense knowledge. Therefore, we propose an AutoML strategy based on emotion congruent effect to select suitable knowledge and models, called AutoML-Emo. Global exploration and local exploitation-based selection mechanisms (G&LESM) are used for automatic knowledge selection. The transformer-based architecture search (TAS) is applied to model selection, the selected transformer-based model is employed to incorporate knowledge and capture context information in conversations. The experimental results show that AutoML-Emo can effectively enhance external knowledge in different sizes and domain datasets. Moreover, the selected transformer-based model derived from TAS is superior to the most advanced models.

AB Facial micro-expressions indicate brief and subtle facial movements that appear during emotional communication. In comparison to macro-expressions, micro-expressions are more challenging to be analyzed due to the short span of time and the fine-grained changes. In recent years, micro-expression recognition (MER) has drawn much attention because it can benefit a wide range of applications, e.g., police interrogation, clinical diagnosis, depression analysis, and business negotiation. In this survey, we offer a fresh overview to discuss new research directions and challenges these days for MER tasks. For example, we review MER approaches from three novel aspects: macro-to-micro adaptation, recognition based on key apex frames, and recognition based on facial action units. Moreover, to mitigate the problem of limited and biased ME data, synthetic data generation is surveyed for the diversity enrichment of micro-expression data. Since micro-expression spotting can boost micro-expression analysis, the state-of-the-art spotting works are also introduced in this paper. At last, we discuss the challenges in MER research and provide potential solutions as well as possible directions for further investigation.

AB Depression is one of the most common mental health disorders, and a large number of depressed people commit suicide each year. Potential depression sufferers usually do not consult psychological doctors because they feel ashamed or are unaware of any depression, which may result in severe delay of diagnosis and treatment. In the meantime, evidence shows that social media data provides valuable clues about physical and mental health conditions. In this paper, we argue that it is feasible to identify depression at an early stage by mining online social behaviours. Our approach, which is innovative to the practice of depression detection, does not rely on the extraction of numerous or complicated features to achieve accurate depression detection. Instead, we propose a novel classifier, namely, Cost-sensitive Boosting Pruning Trees (CBPT), which demonstrates a strong classification ability on two publicly accessible Twitter depression detection datasets. To comprehensively evaluate the classification capability of CBPT, we use additional three datasets from the UCI machine learning repository and CBPT obtains appealing classification results against several state of the arts boosting algorithms. Finally, we comprehensively explore the influence factors for the model prediction, and the results manifest that our proposed framework is promising for identifying Twitter users with depression.

AB Despite the recent advancement in speech emotion recognition (SER) within a single corpus setting, the performance of these SER systems degrades significantly for cross-corpus and cross-language scenarios. The key reason is the lack of generalisation in SER systems towards unseen conditions, which causes them to perform poorly in cross-corpus and cross-language settings. Recent studies focus on utilising adversarial methods to learn domain generalised representation for improving cross-corpus and cross-language SER to address this issue. However, many of these methods only focus on cross-corpus SER without addressing the cross-language SER performance degradation due to a larger domain gap between source and target language data. This contribution proposes an adversarial dual discriminator (ADDi) network that uses the three-players adversarial game to learn generalised representations without requiring any target data labels. We also introduce a self-supervised ADDi (sADDi) network that utilises self-supervised pre-training with unlabelled data. We propose synthetic data generation as a pretext task in sADDi, enabling the network to produce emotionally discriminative and domain invariant representations and providing complementary synthetic data to augment the system. The proposed model is rigorously evaluated using five publicly available datasets in three languages and compared with multiple studies on cross-corpus and cross-language SER. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Very recent work has demonstrated tremendous improvements in facial expression recognition (FER) on laboratory-controlled datasets. However, recognizing facial expressions under in-the-wild conditions still remains challenging, especially on unseen subjects due to high inter-subject variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Probabilistic Attribute Tree Convolutional Neural Network (PAT-CNN) to explicitly deal with large intra-class variations caused by identity-related attributes, e.g., age, race, and gender. Specifically, a PAT module with an associated PAT loss is proposed to learn features in a hierarchical tree structure organized according to identity-related attributes, where the final features are less affected by the attributes. Then, expression-related features are extracted from leaf nodes. Samples are probabilistically assigned to tree nodes at different levels such that expression-related features can be learned from all samples weighted by probabilities. Furthermore, the proposed PAT-CNN can be learned from limited attribute-annotated samples to make the best use of available data. Experimental results on four spontaneous facial expression datasets, i.e., RAF-DB, SFEW, ExpW, and FER-2013, have demonstrated that the proposed PAT-CNN achieves the best performance when compared to state-of-the-art methods by explicitly modeling attributes. Impressively, a single model PAT-CNN achieves the best performance on the SFEW test dataset when compared to the state-of-the-art methods using an ensemble of hundreds of CNNs.

AB Choking under pressure, or underperformance in pressure situations, is a phenomenon feared by many athletes. Psychology research is heavily invested in studying the phenomenon; however, a universal structural approach to objectively analyze choking is yet to be established. The purpose of this work was to study relationships between choking in college tennis and selected physiological, performance, and game statistic variables in order to design a choking detection model. Choking was identified as a newly introduced variable called the choking moment. The introduced variables were measured with wearable sensors and observed from video recordings of college tennis matches. Swing speed and game statistic variables showed strong relationships to choking, and thus appear practical for the proposed choking detection model. Heartrate and footwork performance variables displayed weaker, but still some, patterns potentially related to choking, and thus could serve as supporting parameters for improvements of the choking detection mechanism. This study suggested unique techniques for identification and detection of choking in college tennis by introducing tennis specific variables, data collection framework, and data analysis procedures. The impact of this study is a contribution to the existing choking research by proposing an objective approach to analyze the subjective phenomenon of choking under pressure.

AB Physiological studies have identified that facial dynamics can be considered as biomarkers to analyze depression severity. This paper accordingly develops a Dual Attention and Element Recalibration (DAER) network to extract facial changes to predict the depression level. In this model, we propose two blocks: a Dual Attention (DA) block and Element Recalibration (ER) block. The DA block uses the self-attention to investigate the dynamic changes in the representation sequence of a facial video segment. It further examines the influence of feature components of the representation sequence on depression level prediction through bilinear-attention. Moreover, to improve the representation ability of network, the ER block is used to obtain the global information to recalibrate each element of the tensor. Adopting this approach, for the depression level prediction task, we first divide the long-term video into fixed-length segments and use the trained ResNet50 to encode each frame to generate the representation sequences of video segments. Second, the representation sequences are input into DAER network to obtain the depression level scores. Finally, the average of these scores yields the prediction result corresponding to the long-term video. Experiments on publicly available AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 depression databases illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

ID ATTENTION; NETWORK
AB Aspect-based multimodal sentiment analysis (ABMSA) aims to determine the sentiment polarities of each aspect or entity mentioned in a multimodal post or review. Previous studies to ABMSA can be summarized into two subtasks: aspect-term based multimodal sentiment classification (ATMSC) and aspect-category based multimodal sentiment classification (ACMSC). However, these existing studies have three shortcomings: (1) ignoring the object-level semantics in images; (2) primarily focusing on aspect-text and aspect-image interactions; (3) failing to consider the semantic gap between text and image representations. To tackle these issues, we propose a general Hierarchical Interactive Multimodal Transformer (HIMT) model for ABMSA. Specifically, we extract salient features with semantic concepts from images via an object detection method, and then propose a hierarchical interaction module to first model the aspect-text and aspect-image interactions, followed by capturing the text-image interactions. Moreover, an auxiliary reconstruction module is devised to largely eliminate the semantic gap between text and image representations. Experimental results show that our HIMTmodel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks for ATMSC and one benchmark for ACMSC.

AB Cross-domain sentiment analysis aims to adapt sentiment classification models trained on one or more source domains to the target domain, which can effectively alleviate the problem of insufficient labelled data in specific domains. Unlike most previous methods of adjusting models based on observed data, we propose a novel counterfactual representation augmentation (CRA) method, which aims to improve target-domain generalization by constructing new counterfactual representations for training. Specifically, we train a domain discriminator to learn the domain discrepancy between the source and target domains on unlabeled data, and use a gradient editing method to directly construct counterfactual representations, which reduces the inductive bias of the source domain and augments the training data. Moreover, we further leverage an ensemble-based training method to indirectly encourage the target-domain classifier to rely more on robust features for prediction. Extensive experiments on a widely-used cross-domain sentiment classification benchmark dataset show that our method consistently surpasses different baseline methods on different tasks, demonstrating the strong ability to improve domain generalization. We also find that our model can effectively adjust the decision boundary to make the classifier more robust and generalized, through extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis.

   unsupervised learning; multi-sources attention
AB Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays a crucial role in understanding user feelings when developing artificial intelligence services. However, the data mismatch and label distortion between the training (source) set and the testing (target) set significantly degrade the performances when developing the SER systems. Additionally, most emotion-related speech datasets are highly contextualized and limited in size. The manual annotation cost is often too high leading to an active investigation of unsupervised cross-corpus SER techniques. In this paper, we propose a framework in unsupervised cross-corpus emotion recognition using multi-source corpus in a data augmentation manner. We introduced Corpus-Aware Emotional CycleGAN (CAEmoCyGAN) including a corpus-aware attention mechanism to aggregate each source datasets to generate the synthetic target sample. We choose the widely used speech emotion corpora the IEMOCAP and the VAM as sources and the MSP-Podcast as the target. By generating synthetic target-aware samples to augment source datasets and by directly training on this augmented dataset, our proposed multi-source target-aware augmentation method outperforms other baseline models in activation and valence classification.

AB Activation of the autonomic nervous system is a primary characteristic of human hedonic responses to sensory stimuli. For smells, general tendencies of physiological reactions have been described using classical statistics. However, these physiological variations are generally not quantified precisely; each psychophysiological parameter has very often been studied separately and individual variability was not systematically considered. The current study presents an innovative approach based on data mining, whose goal is to extract knowledge from a dataset. This approach uses a subgroup discovery algorithm which allows extraction of rules that apply to as many olfactory stimuli and individuals as possible. These rules are described by intervals on a set of physiological attributes. Results allowed both quantifying how each physiological parameter relates to odor pleasantness and perceived intensity but also describing the participation of each individual to these rules. This approach can be applied to other fields of affective sciences characterized by complex and heterogeneous datasets.

AB This paper presents our recent research on integrating artificial emotional intelligence in a social robot (Ryan) and studies the robot's effectiveness in engaging older adults. Ryan is a socially assistive robot designed to provide companionship for older adults with depression and dementia through conversation. We used two versions of Ryan for our study, empathic and non-empathic. The empathic Ryan utilizes a multimodal emotion recognition algorithm and a multimodal emotion expression system. Using different input modalities for emotion, i.e., facial expression and speech sentiment, the empathic Ryan detects users' emotional state and utilizes an affective dialogue manager to generate a response. On the other hand, the non-empathic Ryan lacks facial expression and uses scripted dialogues that do not factor in the users' emotional state. We studied these two versions of Ryan with 10 older adults living in a senior care facility. The statistically significant improvement in the users' reported face-scale mood measurement indicates an overall positive effect from the interaction with both the empathic and non-empathic versions of Ryan. However, the number of spoken words measurement and the exit survey analysis suggest that the users perceive the empathic Ryan as more engaging and likable.

ID FACIAL EXPRESSION; PATCHES; MACHINE
AB Facial action units (AUs) refer to a comprehensive set of atomic facial muscle movements. Recent works have focused on exploring complementary information by learning the relationships among AUs. Most existing approaches process AU co-occurrence and enhance AU recognition by learning the dependencies among AUs from labels, however, the complementary information among features of different AUs are ignored. Moreover, ground truth annotations suffer from a large intra-class variance and their associated intensity levels may vary depending on the annotators' experience. In this paper, we propose the Region Attentive AU intensity estimation method with Uncertainty Weighted Multi-task Learning (RA-UWML). A RoI-Net is first used to extract features from the pre-defined facial patches where the AUs locate. Then, we use the co-occurrence of AUs using both within patch and between patches representation learning. Within a given patch, we propose sharing representation learning in a multi-task manner. To achieve complementarity and avoid redundancy between different image patches, we propose to use a multi-head self-attention mechanism to adaptively and attentively encode each patch specific representation. Moreover, the AU intensity is represented as a Gaussian distribution, instead of a single value, where the mean value indicates the most likely AU intensity and the variance indicates the uncertainty of the estimated AU intensity. The estimated variances are leveraged to automatically weight the loss of each AU in the multitask learning model. In extensive experiments on the Disfa, Fera2015 and Feafa benchmarks, it is shown that the proposed AU intensity estimation model achieves better results compared to the state-of-the-art models.

ID ATTENTION; FEATURES
AB Electroencephalography (EEG)-based affective computing has a scarcity problem. As a result, it is difficult to build effective, highly accurate and stable models using machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning models. Data augmentation has recently shown performance improvements in deep learning models with increased accuracy, stability and reduced overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmentation framework, named the generative adversarial network-based self-supervised data augmentation (GANSER). As the first to combine adversarial training with self-supervised learning for EEG-based emotion recognition, the proposed framework generates high-quality and high-diversity simulated EEG samples. In particular, we utilize adversarial training to learn an EEG generator and force the generated EEG signals to approximate the distribution of real samples, ensuring the quality of the augmented samples. A transformation operation is employed to mask parts of the EEG signals and force the generator to synthesize potential EEG signals based on the unmasked parts to produce a wide variety of samples. A masking possibility during transformation is introduced as prior knowledge to generalize the classifier for the augmented sample space. Finally, numerous experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can improve emotion recognition with an increase in performance and achieve state-of-the-art results.

TI Facial Image-Based Automatic Assessment of Equine Pain

AB Recognition of pain in animals is essential for their welfare. However, since there is no verbal communication, this assessment depends solely on the ability of the observer to locate visible or audible signs of pain. The use of grimace scales is proven to be efficient in detecting the pain visually, but the assessment quality depends on the level of training of the assessor and the validity is not easily ensured. There is a clear need for automating the pain assessment process. This work provides a system for pain prediction in horses, based on grimace scales. The pipeline automatically determines the quantitative pose of the equine head and finds facial landmarks before classification, proposing a novel scale-normalisation approach for equine heads. The pain estimation is achieved for each facial region of interest separately, following the clinical pain estimation procedure. We introduce a database of horse images, annotated by professional veterinarians for training and assessment. We also propose a data augmentation method to alleviate the data scarcity issues, which relies on generating realistic 3D equine face models based on 2D annotated images. We show that the data augmentation method improves the performance of both quantitative pose estimation and landmark detection. Our results establish a strong baseline for automatic equine pain estimation.

AB It was observed that accuracy of the Subject-Dependent emotion recognition model was much higher than that of the Subject-Independent modela in the field of electroencephalogram (EEG) based affective computing. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the individual difference of EEG, which is the key issue to be solved for the application of emotion recognition. In this work, 14 subjects from the SEED were selected for individual difference analysis. Through individual aggregation features evaluation, sample space visualization, and correlation analysis, we proposed four quantification indicators to analyze individual difference phenomenon. Finally, we presented the Personal-Zscore (PZ) feature processing method, and it was found that the data set processed with PZ method could represent emotion better than the original data set, and the conventional model with the PZ method was more robust. The accuracies of emotion recognition models trained with PZ processing have been improved to some extent, which showed that the PZ method could effectively eliminate the individual aggregation of feature space and improve the emotional representation ability of data sets. Hence, our findings may provide a new insight into the foundation for universal implementation of EEG-based application, and the Personal-Zscore feature processing method is of great significance for the development of effective emotion recognition system.

AB There is growing interest in affective computing for the representation and prediction of emotions along ordinal scales. However, the term ordinal emotion label has been used to refer to both absolute notions such as low or high arousal, as well as relation notions such as arousal is higher at one instance compared to another. In this paper, we introduce the terminology absolute and relative ordinal labels to make this distinction clear and investigate both with a view to integrate them and exploit their complementary nature. We propose a Markovian framework referred to as Dynamic Ordinal Markov Model (DOMM) that makes use of both absolute and relative ordinal information, to improve speech based ordinal emotion prediction. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on two speech corpora commonly used in affective computing, the RECOLA and the IEMOCAP databases, across a range of system configurations. The results consistently indicate that integrating relative ordinal information improves absolute ordinal emotion prediction.

AB The detection of mild depression is conducive to the early intervention and treatment of depression. This study explored the fusion of electroencephalography (EEG) and pupil area signals to build an effective and convenient mild depression recognition model. We proposed Mutual Information Based Fusion Model (MIBFM), which innovatively used pupil area signals to select EEG electrodes based on mutual information. Then we extracted features from EEG and pupil area signals in different bands, and fused bimodal features using the denoising autoencoder. Experimental results showed that MIBFM could obtain the highest accuracy of 87.03%. And MIBFM exhibited better performance than other existing methods. Our findings validate the effectiveness of the use of pupil area as signals, which makes eye movement signals can be easily obtained using high resolution camera, and the EEG electrode selection scheme based on mutual information is also proved to be an applicable solution for data dimension reduction and multimodal complementary information screening. This study casts a new light for mild depression recognition using multimodal data of EEG and pupil area signals, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of portable and universal application systems.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) may be driven by dysfunction in intrinsic dynamic properties of the brain, and EEG microstate is a promising method for analyzing brain dynamics. However, the alterations in EEG microstate is still not entirely clear, and its ability for MDDs detection is worth probing. Moreover, the mechanism behind the neural networks contributing to microstates remains poorly understood in MDDs. Therefore, we applied microstate analysis and Topographic Electrophysiological State Source-imaging (TESS) on EEG data of 27 MDDs and 28 healthy controls (HCs). Compared to HCs, MDDs had apparent increase in microstate C and decrease in microstate D. Furthermore, TESS results showed that the underlying network of microstate C in MDDs overlapped with the anterior cingulate cortex and left insula gyrus, whereas main source of microstate D was in the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus. The reduced transition probability from C to D in MDDs may reveal an imbalance between the networks of microstates. The microstate parameters as features reached good performance in identifying MDD (89.09% accuracy, 92.86% sensitivity, 85.19% specificity), indicating their potential as biomarkers of depression pathology. Collectively, these results highlight alteration of brain activity patterns and provide new insights into abnormal EEG dynamics in MDDs.

AB Social chatbots have gained immense popularity, and their appeal lies in their capacity to respond to diverse requests, but also in their ability to develop an emotional connection with users. To develop and promote social chatbots, we need to concentrate on increasing user interaction and consider both the intellectual and emotional quotient in conversational agents. In this work, we propose the task of empathetic, personalized dialogue generation giving the machine the capability to respond emotionally and in accordance with the persona of the user. We design a generative adversarial framework, named EP-GAN (Empathy and Persona aware Generative Adversarial Network) to generate responses that are sensitive to the emotion of the user and corresponds to the persona. The persona information is encoded as memory vectors that, along with the dialogue history, are fed to the decoder for generation. An interactive adversarial learning framework is implemented to verify whether the generated responses elicit the emotion and persona in dialogues. Experimental results show that the EP-GAN framework significantly outperforms the existing baselines for both automatic and manual evaluation. We achieve an improvement of 1 point BLEU-4 and 2 points in the emotion accuracy metric compared to the best performing baseline.

AB Space exploration is evolving with the recent increase in interest and investment. For the success of planned long-duration crewed missions, good interpersonal interactions between crew members are crucial. In this study, we evaluate the use of wearables for detection and estimation of the quality of each social interaction participants have throughout a long mission rather than aggregate measures of interactions. Our proposed method utilizes Temporal Convolutional Networks(TCNs) for extracting individual representations from acceleration and audio streams and learnable pooling layers(NetVLAD) to aggregate these representations into fixed-size representations. Use of NetVLAD layers provides an intelligent alternative to simple aggregation for handling variable-sized interactions and interactions with missing data. We evaluate our method on a 4-month simulated space mission where 5 participants wore Sociometric Badges and provided reports on their interactions in terms of effectiveness, frustration, and satisfaction. Our method provides an average ROC-AUC score of 0.64. Since we are not aware of any comparable baselines, we compare our method to hand-crafted features formerly utilized for cohesion estimation in similar scenarios and show it significantly outperforms them. We also present ablation studies where we replace the components in our approach with well-known alternatives and show that they provide better performance than their respective counterparts.

AB Depression is a severe mental illness that impairs a person's capacity to function normally in personal and professional life. The assessment of depression usually requires a comprehensive examination by an expert professional. Recently, machine learning-based automatic depression assessment has received considerable attention for a reliable and efficient depression diagnosis. Various techniques for automated depression detection were developed; however, certain concerns still need to be investigated. In this work, we propose a novel deep multi-modal framework that effectively utilizes facial and verbal cues for an automated depression assessment. Specifically, we first partition the audio and video data into fixed-length segments. Then, these segments are fed into the Spatio-Temporal Networks as input, which captures both spatial and temporal features as well as assigns higher weights to the features that contribute most. In addition, Volume Local Directional Structural Pattern (VLDSP) based dynamic feature descriptor is introduced to extract the facial dynamics by encoding the structural aspects. Afterwards, we employ the Temporal Attentive Pooling (TAP) approach to summarize the segment-level features for audio and video data. Finally, the multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling (MFB) strategy is applied to fuse the multi-modal features effectively. An extensive experimental study reveals that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Interpersonal attraction is known to motivate behavioral responses in the person experiencing this subjective phenomenon. Such responses may involve the imitation of behavior, as in mirroring or mimicry of postures or gestures, which have been found to be associated with the desire to be liked by an interlocutor. Speed dating provides a unique opportunity for the study of such behavioral manifestations of interpersonal attraction through the elimination of barriers to initiating communication, while maintaining significant ecological validity. In this paper we investigate the relationship between body movement, measured via accelerometer sensors, and self-reports or ratings of attraction and affiliation in a dataset of 399 speed dates between 72 subjects. Through machine learning experiments, we found that both features derived from a single individual's body movement and features designed to measure aspects of synchrony and convergence of the couple's body movement signals were predictive of different attraction ratings. Our statistical analysis revealed that the overall increase or decrease in an individual's body movement throughout an interaction is a potential indicator of friendly intentions, possibly related to the desire to affiliate.

AB Prediction of human actions in social interactions has important applications in the design of social robots or artificial avatars. In this paper, we focus on a unimodal representation of interactions and propose to tackle interaction generation in a data-driven fashion. In particular, we model human interaction generation as a discrete multi-sequence generation problem and present SocialInteractionGAN, a novel adversarial architecture for conditional interaction generation. Our model builds on a recurrent encoder-decoder generator network and a dual-stream discriminator, that jointly evaluates the realism of interactions and individual action sequences and operates at different time scales. Crucially, contextual information on interacting participants is shared among agents and reinjected in both the generation and the discriminator evaluation processes. Experiments show that albeit dealing with low dimensional data, SocialInteractionGAN succeeds in producing high realism action sequences of interacting people, comparing favorably to a diversity of recurrent and convolutional discriminator baselines, and we argue that this work will constitute a first stone towards higher dimensional and multimodal interaction generation. Evaluations are conducted using classical GAN metrics, that we specifically adapt for discrete sequential data. Our model is shown to properly learn the dynamics of interaction sequences, while exploiting the full range of available actions.

AB The interest in automatic emotion recognition and the larger field of Affective Computing has recently gained momentum. The current emergence of large, video-based affect datasets offering rich multi-modal inputs facilitates the development of deep learning-based models for automatic affect analysis that currently holds the state of the art. However, recent approaches to process these modalities cannot fully exploit them due to the use of oversimplified fusion schemes. Furthermore, the efficient use of temporal information inherent to these huge data are also largely unexplored hindering their potential progress. In this work, we propose a multi-modal, sequence-based neural network with gating mechanisms for Valence and Arousal based affect recognition. Our model consists of three major networks: Firstly, a latent-feature generator that extracts compact representations from both modalities that have been artificially degraded to add robustness. Secondly, a multi-task discriminator that estimates both input identity and a first step emotion quadrant estimation. Thirdly, a sequence-based predictor with attention and gating mechanisms that effectively merges both modalities and uses this information through sequence modelling. In our experiments on the SEMAINE and SEWA affect datasets, we observe the impact of both proposed methods with progressive increase in accuracy. We further show in our ablation studies how the internal attention weight and gating coefficient impact our models' estimates quality. Finally, we demonstrate state of the art accuracy through comparisons with current alternatives on both datasets.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis is an emerging field of artificial intelligence. The most predominant approaches have made notable progress by designing sophisticated fusion architectures, exploring inter-modal interactions between modalities. However, these works tend to utilize a uniform optimization strategy for each modality, so that only sub-optimal unimodal representations are obtained for multimodal fusion. To address this issue, we propose a novel meta-learning based paradigm that can retain the advantages of unimodal existence and further boost the performance of multimodal fusion. Specifically, we introduce the Adaptive Multimodal Meta-Learning (AMML) to meta-learn the unimodal networks and adapt them for multimodal inference. AMML can (1) effectively obtain more optimized unimodal representation via meta-training on unimodal tasks, which adaptively adjusts the learning rate and assigns a more specific optimization procedure for each modality; (2) and adapt the optimized unimodal representations for multimodal fusion via meta-testing on multimodal tasks. Considering multimodal fusion often suffers from the distributional mismatches between features of different modalities due to heterogeneous nature of the signals, we implement a distribution transformation layer on unimodal representations to regularize the unimodal distributions. In this way, distribution gaps can be reduced to achieve a better effect of fusion. Extensive experiments on two widely-used datasets demonstrate that AMML achieves state-of-the-art performance.

AB The effects of cognitive stress are complex and multi-dimensional with nuanced neural and physiological representations across our lifespan. Chronic and instantaneous stressors are known to alter both executive function and motor performance - a particularly challenging prospect for older adults. Age, sex, and motor activity are critical yet under-represented dimensions in the domain of stress detection. Through the present work, we explore a subset of these variables and the relevance of brain hemodynamics and heart rate variability (HR/V) as biomarkers of stress in an aging population. We rely on a multimodal, sex-balanced, motor-stress data set (N = 59) and an exhaustive machine learning workflow to operationalize the unique neurophysiological states that form the human stress response. We found that a quadratic discriminant was sufficient to separate the two states across feature, demographic, and activity variables. We report a stress detection accuracy between $78-98\%$78-98% when using models trained independently on each feature-set. However, these models were highly sensitive to sex, and activity differences - with distinct regions, and features implicated in stress recognition. Both HR/V and fNIRS based features were excellent indices of cognitive stress, however neither generalized to a degree beneficial toward operational use. Our observations underscore the importance of task-context, age, and sex as factors in modeling stress detection tools for older adults.

AB The high temporal resolution and the asymmetric spatial activations are essential attributes of electroencephalogram (EEG) underlying emotional processes in the brain. To learn the temporal dynamics and spatial asymmetry of EEG towards accurate and generalized emotion recognition, we propose TSception, a multi-scale convolutional neural network that can classify emotions from EEG. TSception consists of dynamic temporal, asymmetric spatial, and high-level fusion layers, which learn discriminative representations in the time and channel dimensions simultaneously. The dynamic temporal layer consists of multi-scale 1D convolutional kernels whose lengths are related to the sampling rate of EEG, which learns the dynamic temporal and frequency representations of EEG. The asymmetric spatial layer takes advantage of the asymmetric EEG patterns for emotion, learning the discriminative global and hemisphere representations. The learned spatial representations will be fused by a high-level fusion layer. Using more generalized cross-validation settings, the proposed method is evaluated on two publicly available datasets DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. The performance of the proposed network is compared with prior reported methods such as SVM, KNN, FBFgMDM, FBTSC, Unsupervised learning, DeepConvNet, ShallowConvNet, and EEGNet. TSception achieves higher classification accuracies and F1 scores than other methods in most of the experiments. The codes are available at:https://github.com/yi-ding-cs/TSception

AB Depression is increasingly impacting individuals both physically and psychologically worldwide. It has become a global major public health problem and attracts attention from various research fields. Traditionally, the diagnosis of depression is formulated through semi-structured interviews and supplementary questionnaires, which makes the diagnosis heavily relying on physicians' experience and is subject to bias. However, since the pathogenic mechanism of depression is still under investigation, it is difficult for physicians to diagnose and treat, especially in the early clinical stage. As smart devices and artificial intelligence advance rapidly, understanding how depression associates with daily behaviors can be beneficial for the early stage depression diagnosis, which reduces labor costs and the likelihood of clinical mistakes as well as physicians bias. Furthermore, mental health monitoring and cloud based remote diagnosis can be implemented through an automated depression diagnosis system. In this article, we propose an attention-based multimodality speech and text representation for depression prediction. Our model is trained to estimate the depression severity of participants using the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) dataset. For the audio modality, we use the collaborative voice analysis repository (COVAREP) features provided by the dataset and employ a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM) followed by a Time-distributed Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN). For the text modality, we use global vectors for word representation (GloVe) to perform word embeddings and the embeddings are fed into the BiLSTM network. Results show that both audio and text models perform well on the depression severity estimation task, with best sequence level F-1 score of 0.9870 and patient-level F-1 score of 0.9074 for the audio model over five classes (healthy, mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe), as well as sequence level F-1 score of 0.9709 and patient-level F-1 score of 0.9245 for the text model over five classes. Results are similar for the multimodality fused model, with the highest F-1 score of 0.9580 on the patient-level depression detection task over five classes. Experiments show statistically significant improvements over previous works.

AB There are few mathematical models that describe how human perceptual and affective responses evolve with time. We developed a state-space model of the interrelationships based on time-evolving perceptual and affective responses acquired by the temporal dominance (TD) method. We defined and computed the state variables that endow the system with memory using canonical variate analysis. Furthermore, we determined the model parameters on the basis of a cross-validation approach such that the observed and estimated changes in the affective responses are highly correlated. We applied this method to the TD curves of responses to eating strawberries and plum pickles, reported in our previous work. The model describes what happens during food intake in terms of a few state variables that summarize a large number of observable responses reductively, thus helping to make the perceptual and affective dynamics understandable.

AB The wide application of smart devices enables the availability of multimodal data, which can be utilized in many tasks. In the field of multimodal sentiment analysis, most previous works focus on exploring intra- and inter-modal interactions. However, training a network with cross-modal information (language, audio and visual) is still challenging due to the modality gap. Besides, while learning dynamics within each sample draws great attention, the learning of inter-sample and inter-class relationships is neglected. Moreover, the size of datasets limits the generalization ability of the models. To address the afore-mentioned issues, we propose a novel framework HyCon for hybrid contrastive learning of tri-modal representation. Specifically, we simultaneously perform intra-/inter-modal contrastive learning and semi-contrastive learning, with which the model can fully explore cross-modal interactions, learn inter-sample and inter-class relationships, and reduce the modality gap. Besides, refinement term and modality margin are introduced to enable a better learning of unimodal pairs. Moreover, we devise pair selection mechanism to identify and assign weights to the informative negative and positive pairs. HyCon can naturally generate many training pairs for better generalization and reduce the negative effect of limited datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition.

AB Recognising apparent emotion from audio-visual signals in naturalistic conditions remains an open problem. Existing methods that build on recurrent models, or in the modelling of contextual dependencies at the feature level using self-attention fail to model the long-term dependencies that subtly occur at different levels of abstraction. Affective Processes have emerged as a novel paradigm to the modelling of temporal dynamics through a probabilistic global latent variable that captures context and induces dependencies in the outputs, showing superior performance with little complexity. Despite its impressive results on visual data, Affective Processes remain unexplored in the domain of audio data, known to crucially influence the perception of emotions. In this paper, we first revisit and extend Affective Processes to the speech domain, identifying the key components and learning procedures for their efficient training. We then extend Affective Processes to audio-visual affect recognition, using modality-specific context encoders. Finally, we propose a novel application of Affective Processes in the domain of Cooperative Machine Learning for propagating affect labels in videos using sparse human supervision. We conduct extensive ablation studies, identifying the main components behind the success of Affective Processes, as well as comparisons against existing works in a variety of datasets.

AB Aspects are opinion targets to extract in aspect-based sentiment analysis. While existing methods can already produce satisfactory extraction results, they suffer when faced with compound aspect terms, typically phrase-level aspect terms that have inner structure and occur infrequently in the training set. This issue can be mainly attributed to the scarcity of training examples targeting compound aspect terms and by the neglect of the syntactic structure of a sentence in the modeling process. In this article, we aim to cope with compound aspect extraction by a two-stage hybrid approach. First, we introduce a conditional generation method for data augmentation in a masked sequence-to-sequence framework, which is controllable to preserve original aspects while generating a new sentence. Second, we propose a constituency lattice structure that is induced from the constituency-based parse tree of a sentence. Experimental results on two review datasets show that this approach can greatly improve the effect of compound aspect extraction.

DE Facial expression recognition; deep ensemble methods; disentangled

ID ADOLESCENTS; ENSEMBLE
AB For a number of machine learning problems, an exogenous variable can be identified such that it heavily influences the appearance of the different classes, and an ideal classifier should be invariant to this variable. An example of such exogenous variable is identity if facial expression recognition (FER) is considered. In this paper, we propose a dual exogenous/endogenous representation. The former captures the exogenous variable whereas the second one models the task at hand (e.g., facial expression). We design a prediction layer that uses a tree-gated deep ensemble conditioned by the exogenous representation. We also propose an exogenous dispelling loss to remove the exogenous information from the endogenous representation. Thus, the exogenous information is used two times in a throwable fashion, first as a conditioning variable for the target task, and second to create invariance within the endogenous representation. We call this method THIN, standing for THrowable Information Networks. We experimentally validate THIN in several contexts where an exogenous information can be identified, such as digit recognition under large rotations and shape recognition at multiple scales. We also apply it to FER with identity as the exogenous variable. We demonstrate that THIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on several challenging datasets.

AB Ethical understanding aims at morally analyzing and discriminating ethical scenarios described in natural language. By classifying behaviors that occur in ethical scenarios as ethical or unethical, ethical understanding empowers artificial intelligence systems to understand human values so as to discern right from wrong morally. However, most existing ethical understanding methods lack fine-grained analysis and cannot handle the problem that an ethical scenario may contain multiple behaviors with multiple polarities. In this paper, we introduce a novel natural language processing task, behavior-based ethical understanding (BEU), for mining the purpose relation(s) and ethical polarity of a specific behavior from the social news. It contains three subtasks: behavior term extraction (BTE) to extracts behavior terms, purpose relation inference (PRI) to identifies purposive relations among behaviors, and polarity discrimination (PD) to predicts the ethical polarities of behaviors, respectively. To perform this task, we constructed a Chinese BEU dataset, named FG-ETHICS. Besides, we propose a three-stage framework, BEU-BERT, based on the pre-trained language model BERT and deliberately designed downstream models for three subtasks. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves the best performance from the BTE and PD tasks, and achieves a promising performance of 75% on the PRI task.

TI An Adversarial Training Based Speech Emotion Classifier With Isolated

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING

DE Speech emotion recognition; Adversarial training; regularization
ID MODEL
AB Speaker individual bias may cause emotion-related features to form clusters with irregular borders (non-Gaussian distributions), making the model sensitive to local irregularities of pattern distributions, resulting in the model over-fit of the in-domain dataset. This problem may cause a decrease in the validation scores in cross-domain (i.e., speaker-independent, channel-variant) implementation. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial training-based classifier to regularize the distribution of latent representations to further smooth the boundaries among different categories. In the regularization phase, the representations are mapped into Gaussian distributions in an unsupervised manner to improve the discriminative ability of the latent representations. A single Gaussian distribution is used for mapping the latent representations in our previous study. In this presented work, we adopt a mixture of isolated Gaussian distributions. Moreover, multi-instance learning was adopted by dividing speech into a bag of segments to capture the most salient part of presenting an emotion. The model was evaluated on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets with in-corpus speaker-independent sittings. In addition, we investigated the accuracy of cross-corpus sittings in simulating speaker-independent and channel-variants. In the experiment, the proposed model was compared not only with baseline models but also with different configurations of our model. The results show that the proposed model is competitive with respect to the baseline, as demonstrated both by in-corpus and cross-corpus validation.

AB This paper proposes a methodology to assess video quality, spatial and social presence, empathy, attitude, and attention in 360-degree videos for immersive communications. The methodology is validated in an experiment which simulates an immersive communication environment where participants attend three conversations of different genre (everyday conversation, educational, and discussion) and from actor and observer acquisition perspectives. We consider three experimental conditions: (A) visualizing and rating the perceptual quality of contents in a Head-Mounted Display (HMD), (B) visualizing the contents in an HMD, and (C) visualizing the contents in an HMD where participants can see their hands and take notes. In all conditions participants visualize the same 360-degree videos, designed and acquired in the context of international experiences. Fifty-four participants were evenly distributed among A, B, and C conditions taking into account their international experience backgrounds (working or studying in a foreign country), obtaining a balanced and diverse sample of participants. In this paper, video quality is evaluated with Single-Stimulus Discrete Quality Evaluation (SSDQE) methodology. Spatial and social presence are evaluated with questionnaires adapted from the literature. Initial empathy is assessed with Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and a questionnaire is designed to evaluate the attitude after the visualization of each video. Attention is evaluated with three questions about the conversations of the contents that had pass/fail answers. The results from the subjective test validate the proposed methodology in immersive communications, showing that video quality experiments can be adapted to conditions imposed by experiments focused on the evaluation of socioemotional features in terms of contents of long-duration, different acquisition perspectives, and genre. In addition, the positive results related to the sense of social and spatial presence imply that technology can be relevant in the analyzed use case. Other main result is that the acquisition perspective greatly influences social presence. Finally, the annotated dataset, Student Experiences Around the World dataset (SEAW-dataset), obtained from the experiment is made publicly available for the research community.

AB Trust between group members has many implications for how well a group performs. In this study, we predict perceived trustworthiness of group members when there are subversive group members. We collected multimodal verbal and nonverbal data from a group interaction experiment. During the interaction, we periodically surveyed the group members about their perceptions of trustworthiness of other group members. We used this data to model the relationship between observable behavior and perceptions of trustworthiness. We report the most predictive features and describe them in the context of existing literature on verbal and nonverbal correlates of trust. This research advances the study of behavioral measurement in groups and the role of behavior on perceived trustworthiness.

DE Facial expression recognition; semi-supervised learning; label noise
ID LABEL NOISE
AB In this paper, we aim to improve the performance of in-the-wild Facial Expression Recognition (FER) by exploiting semi-supervised learning. Large-scale labeled data and deep learning methods have greatly improved the performance of image recognition. However, the performance of FER is still not ideal due to the lack of training data and incorrect annotations (e.g., label noises). Among existing in-the-wild FER datasets, reliable ones contain insufficient data to train robust deep models while large-scale ones are annotated in lower quality. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm named Progressive Teacher (PT) to utilize reliable FER datasets as well as large-scale unlabeled expression images for effective training. On the one hand, PT introduces semi-supervised learning method to relieve the shortage of data in FER. On the other hand, it selects useful labeled training samples automatically and progressively to alleviate label noise. PT uses selected clean labeled data for computing the supervised classification loss and unlabeled data for unsupervised consistency loss. Experiments on widely-used databases RAF-DB and FERPlus validate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with accuracy of 89.57% on RAF-DB. Additionally, when the synthetic noise rate reaches even 30%, the performance of our PT algorithm only degrades by 4.37%.

AB Conversational emotion recognition is a crucial research topic in human-computer interactions. Due to the heavy annotation cost and inevitable label ambiguity, collecting large amounts of labeled data is challenging and expensive, which restricts the performance of current fully-supervised methods in this domain. To address this problem, researchers attempt to distill knowledge from unlabeled data via semi-supervised learning. However, most of these semi-supervised methods ignore multimodal interactive information, although recent works have proven that such interactive information is essential for emotion recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework to seamlessly integrate semi-supervised learning with multimodal interactions, called "Semi-supervised Multi-modal Interaction Network (SMIN)". SMIN contains two well-designed semi-supervised modules, "Intra-modal Interactive Module (IIM)" and "Cross-modal Interactive Module (CIM)" to learn intra- and cross-modal interactions. These two modules leverage additional unlabeled data to extract emotion-salient representations. To capture additional contextual information, we utilize the hierarchical recurrent networks followed with the hybrid fusion strategy to integrate multimodal features. These multimodal features are further utilized for conversational emotion recognition. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets (i.e., IEMOCAP, MELD, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI) demonstrate that SMIN succeeds over existing state-of-the-art strategies on emotion recognition.

AB We evaluated whether a vibrotactile breathing pacer would influence two measures of affect during a cognitive stressor. In particular, we examined whether changes in breathing would be evident, and if so, whether these would mediate the effects of breathing pacer on self-report anxiety and skin conductance. Our results were surprising: although we observed the expected effects on breathing, we were unable to demonstrate that changes in breathing parameters were responsible for the observed changes in self-report anxiety. In addition, we failed to show that the pacer had an impact on skin conductance. In this paper, we investigate why we did not observe the expected effects. We believe our negative results have implications for evaluating technological interventions for affect regulation.

AB Multimodal sentiment analysis has become a focus of research in recent years. However, most studies of multimodal sentiment analysis have considered only signals that are observable by humans, such as linguistic, audio and visual information, whereas the contribution of the multimodal fusion of such signals with unobservable signals, i.e., physiological signals, has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, we aim to investigate effects of physiological signals in multimodal sentiment analysis by evaluating all of the fusion models for different types of sentiment estimation in naturalistic human-agent interaction settings. Our results suggest that physiological features are effective in the unimodal model and that the fusion of linguistic representations with physiological features provides the best results for estimating self-sentiment labels as annotated by the users themselves. In contrast, the tensor fusion of linguistic representations with audiovisual features is effective for estimating sentiment labels as annotated by a third party in regression tasks, which can be derived from the corresponding signals that are observable by humans. A detailed analysis of the self-sentiment estimation results suggests that different modalities play different roles in sentiment estimation, and corresponding implications are discussed.

Previous research treats different segments of EEG signals uniformly, ignoring the fact that emotions are unstable and discrete during an extended period. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step spatial-temporal emotion recognition framework. First, considering that the human emotion has not only "short-term continuity" but also "long-term similarity", we propose a hierarchical self-attention network to jointly model local and global temporal information, so as to localize most related segments and reduce the influence of noise at the temporal level. Second, in order to extract discriminative features at the spatial level to enhance the emotion recognition performance, we further employ the squeeze-and-excitation module (SE module) along with the channel correlation loss (CC-Loss) to select the most task-related channels. We also define a new task called emotion localization, which aims to localize fragments with stronger emotions. We evaluate the proposed method on the proposed emotion localization task and typical emotion recognition task with three publicly available datasets, i.e., SEED, DEAP, and MAHNOB-HCI. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AB Emotion analysis based on peripheral physiological signals has attracted increasing attention recently in affective computing. Previous works usually predict emotional states using a single emotion label for each discrete time. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not sufficient due to the fact that the real-world emotional state is usually a mixture of basic emotions. In this paper, we formulate the emotion analysis as an emotion distribution learning (EDL) problem and make two contributions. First, we establish a standardised dataset containing four negative emotions (anger, disgust, sadness, fear) and three positive emotions (tenderness, joy, amusement), which could be a useful benchmark for the EDL task. Second, we propose an emotion distribution prediction system which has the following distinct characteristics: (1) after processing raw peripheral physiological signals, we compute totally 89 representative features from four channels, i.e., GSR, SKT, ECG and HR, (2) an adaptive feature selection strategy based on recursive feature elimination (RFE) is used to select the most significant features in our EDL task, and (3) we design a dedicated EDL model based on convolution neural networks that takes information from both the feature correlation and the time domain into consideration. Experiments were conducted to validate our proposed system, and the results indicated that (1) the proposed feature selection strategy effectively selects significant features and improves algorithmic performance, and (2) the proposed EDL model can obtain good results in terms of six evaluation measures and outperform existing methods.

AB Traditional facial expression recognition (FER) has achieved satisfactory results to some extent, and most of the current methods are trained and evaluated on a single database. However, in real applications, the training and testing images are often collected in different scenarios, which will lead to performance degeneration. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach, named joint local-global discriminative subspace transfer learning (LGDSTL), for cross-database FER. In LGDSTL, first, we develop a joint local-global graph as the distance metric, in which we not only consider the local discriminative geometric structure for each database, but also consider a global graph to transfer knowledge. In this way, the discrepancy between the two databases will be significantly reduced. Then, we present a pairwise regression function to guide the discriminative subspace transfer learning. Additionally, a data reconstruction constraint is introduced to preserve the main discriminative information. Finally, comparative studies on six popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB EEG signals have been reported to be informative and reliable for emotion recognition in recent years. However, the inter-subject variability of emotion-related EEG signals still poses a great challenge for the practical applications of EEG-based emotion recognition. Inspired by recent neuroscience studies on inter-subject correlation, we proposed a Contrastive Learning method for Inter-Subject Alignment (CLISA) to tackle the cross-subject emotion recognition problem. Contrastive learning was employed to minimize the inter-subject differences by maximizing the similarity in EEG signkal representations across subjects when they received the same emotional stimuli in contrast to different ones. Specifically, a convolutional neural network was applied to learn inter-subject aligned spatiotemporal representations from EEG time series in contrastive learning. The aligned representations were subsequently used to extract differential entropy features for emotion classification. CLISA achieved state-of-the-art cross-subject emotion recognition performance on our THU-EP dataset with 80 subjects and the publicly available SEED dataset with 15 subjects. It could generalize to unseen subjects or unseen emotional stimuli in testing. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal representations learned by CLISA could provide insights into the neural mechanisms of human emotion processing.

AB Previous electroencephalogram (EEG) emotion recognition relies on single-task learning, which may lead to overfitting and learned emotion features lacking generalization. In this paper, a graph-based multi-task self-supervised learning model (GMSS) for EEG emotion recognition is proposed. GMSS has the ability to learn more general representations by integrating multiple self-supervised tasks, including spatial and frequency jigsaw puzzle tasks, and contrastive learning tasks. By learning from multiple tasks simultaneously, GMSS can find a representation that captures all of the tasks thereby decreasing the chance of overfitting on the original task, i.e., emotion recognition task. In particular, the spatial jigsaw puzzle task aims to capture the intrinsic spatial relationships of different brain regions. Considering the importance of frequency information in EEG emotional signals, the goal of the frequency jigsaw puzzle task is to explore the crucial frequency bands for EEG emotion recognition. To further regularize the learned features and encourage the network to learn inherent representations, contrastive learning task is adopted in this work by mapping the transformed data into a common feature space. The performance of the proposed GMSS is compared with several popular unsupervised and supervised methods. Experiments on SEED, SEED-IV, and MPED datasets show that the proposed model has remarkable advantages in learning more discriminative and general features for EEG emotional signals.

ID EXPRESSIONS
AB Despite the success of deep neural networks on facial action unit (AU) detection, better performance depends on a large number of training images with accurate AU annotations. However, labeling AU is time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. Considering AU detection and facial expression recognition (FER) are two highly correlated tasks, and facial expression (FE) is relatively easy to annotate, we consider learning AU detection and FER in a multi-task manner. However, the performance of the AU detection task cannot be always enhanced due to the negative transfer in the multi-task scenario. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Meta Auxiliary Learning method (MAL) that automatically selects highly related FE samples by learning adaptative weights for the training FE samples in a meta learning manner. The learned sample weights alleviate the negative transfer from two aspects: 1) balance the loss of each task automatically, and 2) suppress the weights of FE samples that have large uncertainties. Experimental results on several popular AU datasets demonstrate MAL consistently improves the AU detection performance compared with the state-of-the-art multi-task and auxiliary learning methods. MAL automatically estimates adaptive weights for the auxiliary FE samples according to their semantic relevance with the primary AU detection task.

AB People often encounter highly stressful, emotion-evoking situations. Modeling and predicting people's behavior in such situations, how they cope, is a critical research topic. To that end, we propose a computational model of coping that casts Lazarus's theory of coping into a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation. We also conducted a series of controlled experiments simulating a hurricane experience to investigate how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation. The results support the model's assumptions showing that the proposed features are significantly associated with the evacuation decisions and people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation.

AB Recent visual-based depression recognition methods mostly use hand-crafted features with information lost in color channels, or deep network features with a limited performance from the finite data. In this paper, we propose a method called Local Quaternion and Global Deep Network (LQGDNet) which can combine advantages from hand-crafted and deep features. Specifically, the Quaternion XOR Asymmetrical Regional Local Gradient Coding (XOR-AR-LGC) is first designed, which encodes the facial images with local textures in the quaternion domain to keep the dependence of color channels, and integrated into the Quaternion Feature Extractor (QFE). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to use a quaternion-based method for facial depression recognition. Second, we design the Local Quaternion Representation Module (LQRM) composed of Local Deep Feature Extractor (LDFE) and QFE to output local quaternion facial features. Third, global deep facial features are encoded from the Global Deep Representation Module (GDRM) with the deep convolutional neural network. Finally, the LQGDNet integrates LQRM and GDRM with the local quaternion and global deep features and predicts the depression score. The experimental results on AVEC 2013 and AVEC 2014 show the superiority of our method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

AB There is a large interest in the annotation of speech addressed to infants. Infant-directed speech (IDS) has acoustic properties that might pose a challenge to automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools developed for adult-directed speech (ADS). While ASR tools could potentially speed up the annotation process, their effectiveness on this speech register is currently unknown. In this study, we assessed to what extent open-source ASR tools can successfully transcribe IDS. We used speech data from 21 Dutch mothers reading picture books containing target words to their 18- and 24-month-old children (IDS) and the experimenter (ADS). In Experiment 1, we examined how the ASR tool Kaldi-NL performs at annotating target words in IDS vs. ADS. We found that Kaldi-NL only found 55.8% of target words in IDS, while it annotated 66.8% correctly in ADS. In Experiment 2, we aimed to assess the difficulties in annotating IDS more broadly by transcribing all IDS utterances manually and comparing the word error rates (WERs) of two different ASR systems: Kaldi-NL and WhisperX. We found that WhisperX performs significantly better than Kaldi-NL. While there is much room for improvement, the results show that automatic transcriptions provide a promising starting point for researchers who have to transcribe a large amount of speech directed at infants.

AB Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSNs) energy utilization is the most important trouble in recent years various research works going related to it. Clustering approaches are most proficient methods to accomplish the energy utilization. Cluster Heads (CHs) determination is a significant task in MWSNs as it utilizes huge energy while receiving, broadcasting, capturing the data from IoT nodes and broadcast it to the Basestation (BS). Inappropriate choice of CHs utilizes energy so that diminishes network existence. An energy resourceful network with appropriate optimization methodology is to be espoused to determine the CHs. A clustered methodology is proposed based on Tiger Swarm Optimization (TSO) approach to diminish the energy spending throughout cluster formation and broadcast stage. TSO clustered approach is established to consider parameters as intra cluster remoteness among of sensors to CH and lingering energy of sensors. The approach is experimented broadly on diverse environments, unstable sensors and CHs. The proposed TSO is evaluated with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) and Multi-objective Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (MHGA) based on data delivery, delay, lingering energy are simulated in ns2.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)UAV( finds its significant application in video surveillance due to its low cost, high portability and fast-mobility. In this paper, the proposed approach focuses on recognizing the human activity in aerial video sequences through various keypoints detected on the human body via OpenPose. The detected keypoints are passed onto machine learning and deep learning classifiers for classifying the human actions. Experimental results demonstrate that multilayer perceptron and SVM outperformed all the other classifiers by reporting an accuracy of 87.80% and 87.77% respectively whereas LSTM did not produce very good results as compared to other classifiers. Stacked Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM( produced an accuracy of 71.30% and Bidirectional LSTM yielded an accuracy of 76.04%. The results also indicate that machine learning models performed better than deep learning models. The major reason for this finding is the lesser availability of data and the deep learning models being data hungry models require a large amount of data to work upon. The paper also analyses the failure cases of OpenPose by testing the system on aerial videos captured by a drone flying at a higher altitude. This work provides a baseline for validating machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers against recognition of human action from aerial videos.

AB In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), clustering is an effective method to distribute the load equally among all the nodes as compared to flat network architecture. Due to the dynamic nature of the network, the clustering process can be viewed as a dynamic optimization problem and the conventional computational intelligence techniques are not enough to solve these problems. The Dynamic Genetic Algorithm (DGA) addresses these problems with the help of searching optimal solutions in new environments. Therefore the dynamic load-balanced clustering process is modeled using the basic components of standard genetic algorithm and then the model is enhanced is using immigrants and memory-based schemes to elect suitable cluster heads. The metrics nodes' residual energy level, node centrality, and mobility speed of the nodes are considered to elect the load-balanced cluster heads and the optimal number of cluster members are assigned to each cluster head using the proposed DGA schemes such as Random Immigrants Genetic Approach (RIGA), Memory Immigrants Genetic Approach (MIGA), and Memory and Random Immigrants Genetic Approach (MRIGA). The simulation results show that the proposed DGA scheme MRIGA outperforms well as compared with RIGA and MIGA in terms of various performance metrics such as the number of nodes alive, residual energy level, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and overhead for the formation of clusters.

AB A codebook is a combination of vectors that represents a digital image best and very useful tool for compression. Besides the well-known techniques such as Linde-Buzo-Gray, C-Means, and Fuzzy C-Means the nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms have also become alternate techniques for solving the codebook generation problem. Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FFA) is a simple and efficient algorithm, but the capturing of an agent by a local minimum point is the main problem. Therefore, the fruit flies generally do not reach the global solution at the end of the iterations. In this study, the FFA is empowered with a smart exponential flight approach to finding out a global optimum codebook. In this approach, if a fruit fly agent is captured by a local minimum point accidentally, the smart exponential flight steps provide an opportunity to escape from it easily. In the experimental studies, successful compression results have been taken in terms of lower error rates. The numerical results prove that the proposed Smart Exponential flight-based Fruit Fly Algorithm (SE-FFA) is better than the variations of convolutional FFA by providing a global optimum codebook.

AB Traffic sign detection is a key part of intelligent assisted driving, but also a challenging task due to the small size and different scales of objects in foreground and closed range. In this paper, we propose a new traffic sign detection scheme: Spatial Pyramid Pooling and Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion based Yolov3 (SPP and ASFF-Yolov3). In order to integrate the target detail features and environment context features in the feature extraction stage of Yolov3 network, the Spatial Pyramid Pooling module is introduced into the pyramid network of Yolov3. Additionally, Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion module is added to the target detection phase of the pyramid network of Yolov3 to avoid the interference of different scale features with the process of gradient calculation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed SPP and ASFF-Yolov3 network, which achieves better detection results than the original Yolov3 network. It can archive real-time inference speed despite inferior to the original Yolov3 network. The proposed scheme will add an option to the solutions of traffic sign detection with real-time inference speed and effective detection results.

AB Gas-liquid two-phase flow is widely involved in many scientific and technological fields, such as energy, electricity, nuclear energy, aerospace and environmental protection. In some fields, extracting the accurate position of bubbles in space can not only accurately capture the characteristics of bubbles in two-phase flow, but also plays an important role in the subsequent research like bubble tracking. It has got some progresses to use Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) to identify bubbles in gas-liquid two-phase flow, while accurate pixel segmentation map in the bubble identification problem is more desirable in many areas. In this paper, VGG16-FCN model and U-Net model are utilized to identify bubbles in two-phase flow images from the perspective of semantic segmentation. LabelMe is used to label the images in the experiment, which can remove the noise in the original image. In addition, bubble pixels with low ratio relative to the background affects the loss function value tinily which cause the irrational evaluation for the recognition in traditional semantic segmentation, thus, Dice loss is used as the loss function for training to improve the recognition effect. The research results show that the two deep learning models have strong feature extraction ability and accurately detect the bubble boundary.

AB In this paper, we propose a new linear algorithm to tackle a specific class of unrelated machine scheduling problem, considered as an important real-life situation, which we called Batch Scheduling on Unrelated Machine (BSUM), where we have to schedule a batch of identical and non-preemptive jobs on unrelated parallel machines. The objective is to minimize the makespan (C-max) of the whole schedule. For this, a mathematical formulation is made and a lower bound is computed based on the potential properties of the problem in order to reduce the search space size and thus accelerate the algorithm. Another property is also deducted to design our algorithm that solves this problem. The latter is considered as a particular case of Rm||C-max family problems known as strongly NP-hard, therefore, a polynomial reduction should realize a significant efficiency to treat them. As we will show, Batch BSUM is omnipresent in several kind of applications as manufacturing, transportation, logistic and routing. It is of major importance in several company activities. The problem complexity and the optimality of the algorithm are reported, proven and discussed.

AB This paper proposes a parametric study of modified rectangular microstrip antenna in the frequency range between 1.4-2.65 GHz for wireless communication applications, incorporating with optimization methods Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Fruit Fly Optimization (FOA). To design an antenna using optimization methods a fitness function of required parameters is needed. The resonance frequency of Microstrip Patch Antennas (MPAs) depends on various parameters and a standard frequency function does not exist for MPAs. In this study, a rectangular patch antenna is designed for the required resonance frequency and modified with circular quarter slots. The frequency-shift with the change of design variables, which are the substrate thickness and the radius of the slots, is observed. The resonance frequency is obtained as a function of the design variables and it is used in the optimization process to minimize the difference between the target frequency and the calculated one. The original algorithms FOA and PSO have been adapted for its application to a modified rectangular patch antenna design problem: resonance frequency and design of antenna. The design parameter values obtained via optimization and the performances of the optimization methods are presented. The results showed that both PSO and FOA find the dimensions correctly. It is also observed that the sensitivity of the FOA increases with the fruit fly population and the convergence gets faster. The outcomes of this paper show that the PSO algorithm gives better results when compared to the FOA for the proposed antenna.

AB In this research, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based image equalization is projected to enhance the contrast of different breast cancer images. Breast cancer is the highest and another important root of tumor disease in females worldwide. Mass and microcalcification clusters are a significant early signs of breast cancer. The mortality rate can effectively be decreased by early diagnosis and treatment. Most practical approach for the early detection and identification of breast cancer diseases is mammography. Mammographic images contaminated by noise usually involve image enhancement techniques to aid interpretation. Contrast enhancement is divided into two categories: development of direct contrast and enhancement of indirect contrast. Indirect contrast improvement is used in the image histogram update. Histogram Equalization (HE) is the modest enhancement of the indirect contrast approach usually used for contrast enhancement. The proposed method's average entropy is 5.3251 with the highest structural similarity index 0.99725. The best contrast improvement of this method is 1.0404 and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is 46.3803. The MSE value is 2157.08. This paper recommends an innovative method of enhancing digital mammogram image contrast based on different HE approaches. The performance of the projected method has been related to other prevailing techniques using the parameters, namely, discrete entropy, contrast improvement index, structural similarity index measure, mean square error, and peak signal-to-noise ratio. Investigational findings indicate that the projected strategy is efficient and robust and shows better results than others.

AB Datasets of text images are important for optical text recognition systems. Such datasets can be used to enhance performance and recognition rates. In this research work, we present a bilingual dataset consists of Arabic/English text images to address the lack of availability of bilingual text databases. The presented dataset consists of 97812 text images, which are categorized into two groups; Scanned page and digitized line images. Images of the two forms are written with 10 fonts and four sizes, and prepared/scanned with four dpi resolutions. The dataset preparation process includes text collection, text editing, image construction, and image processing. The dataset can be used in optical text recognition, optical font recognition, language identification, and segmentation. Different text recognition and language identification experiments have been conducted using images of the dataset and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classifier. For the digitized images recognition experiments, the best-achieved recognition correctness is 99.01% and the best accuracy is 99.01%. The font that has the highest recognition rates was Tahoma. For the scanned images recognition experiments, Tahoma has also shown the highest performance with 97.86% for correctness and 97.73% for accuracy. For the language identification experiments, Tahoma has shown the performance with 99.98% for word-language identification rate.

AB Although significant advances have been made recently in the field of ethnics recognition through face recognition, there is still a lack of studies of ethnics recognition through facial recognition. This study is concerned with ethnics recognition through facial representation using a few images used as samples for any selected group of ethnics using a deep neural network with a Variational Feature Learning (VFL) loss function that has been used to increase the performance accuracy during the evaluation process. The output of a deep neural network is an embedding of 128 bytes for each face image in each group of ethnics. After that, all embeddings of every face in each group of ethnics pass to a machine learning classification method like a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We achieved state-of-the-art ethnic recognition. The system achieved a classification accuracy of 97.3% on a collected group of image dataset collected from three different countries.

AB Network demands are expanding dramatically, especially in educational sectors where systems are acting in a non-tradition network environment. Most of the services are published on the cloud so students can access teaching or learning materials directly; such demand is a heavy burden to systems administrators who needs to monitor critical educational services around the clock. However, such solutions need efforts, money, time, and space to be built; in this paper, the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed as a small and cheap device that can be installed and configured to analyze packets locally for each service while analyzed logs can be synced simultaneously to have a complete view about systems behavior from any location for the education's system. Based on the results, the proposed approach showed a significant solution for the heavy demands on the educational system. Moreover, the results showed that the presented approach is more efficient when compared to the state of art packet analysis and monitoring approaches.

ID SYSTEM
AB The main purpose of the classification of fingerprints is to devise a formula by which a given collection of fingerprints can be tracked and registered. To accelerate the system for classifying fingerprints, it is necessary to utilize fingerprint image characteristics and avoid the different fingerprint forms arising from fingerprint rotation. This paper presents a simple, new approach to the extraction of characteristics from fingerprint images. The proposed method demonstrates that, for a given image, the features remain constant even after being subjected to a wide range of rotations; thus, it creates an array of characteristics which can be used to identify a person from their fingerprint. To achieve this goal, a basic hit- and-miss operation with different structural components is used to detect and count various features in the fingerprint picture; these features are directly identified based on the texture of the fingerprint. The chosen features are used to index the finger image by generating a frequency of occurrences for each one, such that every fingerprint is represented as a vector of these features. The application of the proposed method shows efficient utilization of execution time and memory usage.

AB In the case of insufficient illumination conditions, the quality of the captured image is poor. At this time, increasing the brightness of the dark region of the whole image will inevitably aggravate noise pollution. Therefore, the ideal state of low-light image enhancement should be to make the dark areas brighter while not allowing the noise part to be enhanced as well. In this paper, we combine Retinex theory and convolutional neural networks to build a simple and effective model with three sub-modules: the decomposition module, illumination module, and reflection module, in which the decomposition module is used to decompose the input low-light image into illumination and reflection maps, the illumination module improves the feature extraction part of the simple convolutional layer used previously and constitutes a new feature extraction structure by Depthwise separable convolution, which makes up for the shortcoming that some dark areas are not well brightened and better adjusts the brightness of the illumination map, and the reflection module adjusts the texture details more clearly because it adds the illumination map as a reference. In this way, the original space is decoupled into two smaller subspaces to the extent that better results can be achieved. We demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of the design and its superiority over state-of-the-art techniques, especially in terms of robustness to severe visual defects and flexibility in adjusting luminance.

AB In this article, we propose a computational-based partitioning (CBP) and Strong (a, ss)-cut based novel intuitionistic fuzzy time series (IFTS) forecasting method. Construction of intervals, intuitionistic fuzzification of time series data, appropriate intuitionistic fuzzy logical relationships (IFLRs), and procedure of defuzzification are critical issues that affect the forecasting accuracy of any IFTS method. A Computational-based partitioning approach uses basic statistical parameters to determine the number of intervals and constructing of intervals without specialized knowledge of the domain. For intuitionistic fuzzification of time series data, all those intuitionistic fuzzy sets are taken having both non-zero membership and non-membership grade. A Strong (a, ss)-cut are used to choose apposite IFLRs that deliver importance in investigating the tendency of time series data. We also propose a defuzzification approach to get the numerical values. In this article, two popular historical time series datasets are used to demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed forecasting method. Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are used to verify the performance of the proposed method. Verification of the validity of the proposed forecasting method is authenticated by using the values of the Theil inequality coefficient (U) and tracking signal (TS).

AB Accurate power load prediction plays a key role in reducing resource waste and ensuring stable and safe operations of power systems. To address the problems of poor stability and unsatisfactory prediction accuracy of existing prediction methods, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for short-term power load prediction by improving the sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model based on bidirectional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network. Different from existing prediction models, we apply convolutional neural network, attention mechanism, and Bayesian optimization for the improvement of the Seq2Seq model. Moreover, in the data processing stage, we use the random forest algorithm for feature selection, and also adopt the weighted grey relational projection algorithm for holiday load processing to process the data and thereby overcome the difficulty of holiday load prediction. To validate our model, we choose the power load dataset in Singapore and Switzerland as experimental data and compare our prediction results with those by other models to show that our method can generate a higher prediction accuracy.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ALGORITHM
AB In molecular biology, gene expression analysis is one of the important research areas which deals with identifying the genes having similar functionality known as co-expressed genes. Data mining techniques like clustering are frequently employed for grouping gene expressions with similar functional characteristics. Numerous such clustering techniques are available for gene expression analysis. Usually, gene expression datasets are a result of millions of measurements due to which they possess high dimensionality and noise which makes the conventional distance measures ineffective. On the other hand, entropy-based distance computation is much more efficient to capture the inhomogeneity in large dimensional data and is also quite insensitive to noise. To exploit these advantages, we propose a novel method to compute the density distribution of data points in high-dimensional and noisy gene expression datasets using the concept of entropy. After obtaining the density distribution, an existing technique known as "Extreme Clustering" is used to obtain the desired clusters present in the gene expressions dataset. The proposed technique is implemented and evaluated on diversified microarray gene expression datasets. Experiment results show that the proposed technique outperforms other popular density-based techniques in terms of cluster quality, robustness against noise, and biological significance of the genes within the clusters.

AB Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a widely used management technique to identify potential failure modes in products, processes, systems, and services to assign limited resources for implement-ing improvement efforts. For the FMEA with a number of experts, the experts may take different influences on the decision-making process due to the difference between individual rationality and cognition and the influence of social relations. Besides, incomplete weights of risk factors are vital to capturing the fuzziness of experts' evaluation. Therefore, this paper proposes a consensus-based FMEA method to explore that how cooperative relationship network of experts, the consensus process, and incomplete weight information of risk factors in FMEA influence the decision-making process. First, a consensus reaching process considering cooperative relationships between experts, the self-confidence of experts, and minimum adjustment of expert opinion is proposed to derive a collective evaluation of group. Afterward, the stochastic multicriteria acceptability analysis method is integrated with the gained and lost dominance score method to deal with incomplete weights of risk factors in the FMEA. The proposed method is employed in a case study about ranking the failure modes of stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung cancer patients. The robustness and feasibility of the proposed method are validated by comparative analysis.

SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING

   Meta-learning
AB To date, various meta-learning methods have been explored to face the data-scarcity problem in fault diagnosis. Almost without exception, these methods work on the premise that an auxiliary dataset close or related to the target data exists and can be employed as a background set to pre-train a deep network. However, in diversified industrial applications, such an appropriate dataset is not always available or requires heavy time and resource consumption for search. To address this problem, a Gradient Flow-based Meta Generative Adversarial Network (GFMGAN) is proposed for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery under the condition of insufficient training data. In the proposed method, a novel architecture taking an Unconditional Generative Model from A Single Natural Image (SinGAN) as the backbone is developed to capture the data distribution from several signal patches, permitting the training on few training data. Then, a gradient flow-based meta-learning technique is introduced into the GFMGAN to modify its learning property and further boost its generative ability. The welltrained GFMGAN can produce sufficient imitated samples. Thereafter, the quality of the generated data is evaluated by three methods, namely Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based spectrum analysis, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)-based feature visualization, and novel Gramian Angular Summation Fields (GASF)-based signal imaging. Ultimately, these newly generated vibration signals are employed as supplementary data to train the classification model and to finish diagnosis tasks downstream. Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework over other state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a novel approach for DC faults diagnosis in renewables based DC-ring microgrid (DC-RM). The proposed novel approach consists of a second-order derivative current (SODC) approach, which is adequate for isolation of faults due to its accurate fault detection and faster response during fault. Moreover, this approach is also used to estimate the fault location using cable parameters. On the other hand, most powerful weighted broad learning system (WBLS) is developed for faults classification. However, WBLS has a major challenge i.e., random generation of weights or fixed weights for the input data, which is connected to WBLS network. To address that and generate the suitable weights according to the statistical feature data, optimized WBLS is developed by hybridizing the sine-cosine algorithm (SCA) and chaotic salp swarm algorithm (CSSA), called SC-CSSA-WBLS. Here, the most influential features are used to extract the data from the simulated DC fault current signals. The role of SSA and SCA in the WBLS is to enhance the initialization of population, convergence speed, and search capabilities of both local exploitation and global exploration. Further, the efficacy of the proposed algorithm is validated during different case studies and its superiority is evidenced in terms of detection time, relative computational time, classification accuracy, and relative error when compared to state-of-the-art techniques in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Finally, a real-time hardware setup is implemented using dSPACE DS1104 embedded processor to isolate the various faults that occurred on the DC microgrid accurately using adaptive threshold strategy of SODC approach. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Class imbalance Learning (CIL) is an important machine learning branch. Due to an imbalanced dataset, the efficiency of the classifiers is impacted. Various under/oversampling approaches are applied to the dataset to solve the class imbalance problem. The most successful among all the present solutions for data imbalance is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) which has a broad range of handling real-world applications. Noise and borderline examples are the two factors that degrade the performance of SMOTE and its variants. To address these issues, filtering-based methods have been developed. However, there are drawbacks associated with the filtering method. Firstly, error detection approaches in filtering methods are highly dependent on parameter settings. Secondly, samples identified during error detection are deleted or filtered from the sampling process which leads to abnormality of obtaining decision boundary and thus problem of again the class imbalance problem. To fix the problems associated with state-of-the-art filtering-based approaches, a novel oversampling filter-based method SMOTE-TLNN-DEPSO is proposed in this paper. In this hybrid variant SMOTE-TLNN-DEPSO, using SMOTE method the synthetic samples are generated to enhance the original class-imbalance data. Next, the two-layer natural neighbors' technique is used for error detection which identifies the noisy and borderline examples. Lastly, instead of deleting the identified noisy and borderline examples, the hybrid variant of the differential evolution (DE) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) called DEPSO is applied to optimize and modify iteratively the position (attributes). SMOTE-TLNN-DEPSO technique shows the advantage over other state of art SMOTE-based filtering-based approaches by solving the noise problem; the error detection technique using the nearest neighbor is parameter-free; Utilizing DEPSO approach the identified noisy samples by error detection technique are optimized instead of removing them. This helps in maintaining the imbalance ratio and improving the boundary; this approach is very appropriate for data sets having more noisy attributes especially class attributes the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed SMOTE-TLNN-DEPSO are demonstrated by exhaustive comparison experiments on artificial and real data sets.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recently, deep learning has started to play an essential role in healthcare applications, including image search in digital pathology. Despite the recent progress in computer vision, significant issues remain for image searching in histopathology archives. A well-known problem is AI bias and lack of generalization. A more particular shortcoming of deep models is the ignorance toward search functionality. The former affects every model, the latter only search and matching. Due to the lack of ranking-based learning, researchers must train models based on the classification error and then use the resultant embedding for image search purposes. Moreover, deep models appear to be prone to internal bias even if using a large image repository of various hospitals. This paper proposes two novel ideas to improve image search performance. First, we use a ranking loss function to guide feature extraction toward the matching-oriented nature of the search. By forcing the model to learn the ranking of matched outputs, the representation learning is customized toward image search instead of learning a class label. Second, we introduce the concept of sequestering learning to enhance the generalization of feature extraction. By excluding the images of the input hospital from the matched outputs, i.e., sequestering the input domain, the institutional bias is reduced. The proposed ideas are implemented and validated through the largest public dataset of whole slide images. The experiments demonstrate superior results compare to the-state-of-art. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Diagnosing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains a challenge due to its complexity and insufficient evidence available for its diagnosis. Recent research in the field of psychiatry suggests that there are no clear causes for ASD, but a hypothesis is raised that abnormalities in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), which is connected to visual cortex regions, can serve as a critical indicator of ASD. Inspired by this hypothesis, this paper proposes a deep learning model with two parts to diagnose ASD by utilizing functional brain connectivity between STS and visual cortex. The first part is a residual attention network that selectively extracts the structural and temporal features from 4D brain images while maintaining dynamic connectivity between the two regions. The second part is a graph convolutional network that determines ASD from the graph with 39 nodes constructed by the residual attention network. Experiments with the fMRI data from 800 patients known as ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) and 10-fold cross-validation show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by achieving 11.37%p improvement in the ASD classification. Additional analyses justify each part of the proposed model through an ablation study and various visualizations. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Landslides are among the most devastating natural hazards, severely impacting human lives and damaging property and infrastructure. Landslide susceptibility maps, which help to identify which regions in a given area are at greater risk of a landslide occurring, are a key tool for effective mitigation. Research in this field has grown immensely, ranging from quantitative to deterministic approaches, with a recent surge in machine learning (ML)-based computational models. The development of ML models, in particular, has undergone a meteoritic rise in the last decade, contributing to the successful development of accurate susceptibility maps. However, despite their success, these models are rarely used by stakeholders owing to their "black box"nature. Hence, it is crucial to explain the results, thus providing greater transparency for the use of such models. To address this gap, the present work introduces the use of an ML-based explainable algorithm, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), for landslide susceptibility modeling. A convolutional neural network model was used conducted in the CheongJu region in South Korea. A total of 519 landslide locations were examined with 16 landslideaffected variables, of which 70% was used for training and 30% for testing, and the model achieved an accuracy of 89%. Further, the comparison was performed using Support Vector Machine mode, which achieved an accuracy of 84%. The SHAP plots showed variations in feature interactions for both landslide and non-landslide locations, thus providing more clarity as to how the model achieves a specific result. The SHAP dependence plots explained the relationship between altitude and slope, showing a negative relationship with altitude and a positive relationship with slope. This is the first use of an explainable ML model in landslide susceptibility modeling, and we argue that future works should include aspects of explainability to open up the possibility of developing a transferable artificial intelligence model. & COPY; 2023 The Authors.

AB The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most significant problems in operational research today. VRP has a vast range of application fields such as transportation, logistics, manufacturing, relief systems and communication. To suit the needs of different real-world VRP scenarios, many models of VRP have been developed - CVRP (Capacitated VRP) being the classical form. In this article, a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm, ICAHGS, is proposed for solving CVRP. The present study proposes a refined Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) as the primary evolutionary and multipopulation method for addressing the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). In order to further optimize the search process, a Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS-CVRP) algorithm is applied as an enhanced local search and population management strategy within the ICA framework. Additionally, the internal restart step of the HGS-CVRP algorithm is replaced with a multi-step restart mechanism for intensification improvement. One notable aspect of the proposed method is its ability to facilitate parallel processing, with each empire able to be processed on a separate processor. This structure allows for increased computational efficiency in addressing the CVRP. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it has been compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The results of this comparison, which include both classical benchmark instances and real-world applications, demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In resolving multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problems, it is observed that the solution process is frequently affected by the available vague information together with intra-personal uncertainties associated with expert's opinion. In most of the time fuzzy set or its existing variants fail to capture such uncertainties for making reasonable balance in decision making processes. To reduce the effects of uncertainties, this paper introduces a new variant of fuzzy set, viz., type-2 Pythagorean fuzzy set (T2PFS). The main advantage of using T2PFS in MCDM is that the membership and non-membership values of each argument are presented by Pythagorean fuzzy numbers rather than using fuzzy number or intuitionistic fuzzy number. In model formulation process, at first, T2PFS is explicitly formulated and some basic operations are defined. Subsequently, four aggregation operators are constructed to aggregate the arguments, and their properties are verified. Afterwards, two information measures and a score function are defined. Moreover, two MCDM algorithms based on the developed aggregation operators and TOPSIS are framed. To show the application potentiality of the proposed method, a case study relating to the selection of sustainable transport system in India is considered and solved. In the case study five different fuel-based vehicles, mostly used in India in recent times, are evaluated by the experts as transport alternatives with the consideration of thirteen sustainability related criteria. From the achieved result it is found that in future electric cars would become the most sustainable vehicle in India. Sensitivity analysis of the developed models and comparative study with existing fuzzy and non-fuzzy MCDM methods establish effectiveness of the developed models. This study may facilitate transport authority to select appropriate transport system in connection with sustainable development of a region.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recent years, informatization methods have been gradually applied to medical treatment, in which machine learning and evolutionary computation play an important role. However, the effective methods for the study of multi-factor disease evolutionary process are still largely open. There are some issues in the field of disease analysis, such as the lack of visual multi-factor disease evolution model and effective analysis methods. For a universal method of data analysis and medical diagnosis, the machine learning algorithms should be combined with the formal modeling methods to fully realize the complementary advantages, make model has the advantages of visualization and efficient data analysis. This work proposes a novel research idea for the modeling analysis of current multi-factor diseases and reveal its feasibility, so as to explore potential pharmaceutical targets and enable doctors and patients to better understand the evolution process of multi-factor diseases. It is worth mentioning that, in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed idea, we applied it to the analysis of the role of monoamine hormones in depression. The model incorporates the machine learning algorithms, and it finally outputs the pathogenic probability under different hormone levels, reflecting the importance of different factors on depression. The application case proved that we provide a clear process model and a novel research method for multi-factor disease evolutionary process analysis.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A heat diffusion graph network (HDGN) is proposed in this paper, which retains more similar graph sig-nals in the spectral domain, for few-shot learning. Convolution on the graph is essentially the filtering of the graph signal. Most existing graph-network-based few-shot learning methods process graph signals with high-pass filters to get the difference in information. However, the low-frequency similar informa-tion is usually more valuable in the few-shot tasks. A joint low-pass filter is constructed to filter low -frequency graph signals, that is, heat kernel convolution aggregates similar information from neighboring nodes. The obtained low-frequency similarity information is utilized to update the representations of nodes on the graph. In addition, a more robust mixed metric is designed to dynamically update the edge feature of the graph. Predicting Unknown Nodes on Graphs by Alternating Updates of Node Representa-tion and Edge Matrix. The experimental results also demonstrate that HDGN achieves better performance for the few-shot classification task.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   computing; Quantum optimization algorithms
AB Optimization is one of the research areas where quantum computing could bring significant ben-efits. In this scenario, a hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithm, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is receiving much attention for its potential to efficiently solve combinatorial optimization problems. This approach works by using a classical optimizer to identify appropriate parameters of a problem-dependent quantum circuit, which ultimately performs the optimization process. Unfortunately, learning the most appropriate QAOA circuit parameters is a complex task that is affected by several issues, such as search landscapes characterized by many local optima. Moreover, gradient-based optimizers, which have been pioneered in this context, tend to waste quantum computing resources. Therefore, gradient-free approaches are emerging as promising methods to address this parameter-setting task. Following this trend, this paper proposes, for the first time, the use of genetic algorithms as gradient-free methods for optimizing the QAOA circuit. The proposed evolutionary approach has been evaluated in solving the MaxCut problem for graphs with 5 to 9 nodes on a noisy quantum device. As the results show, the proposed genetic algorithm statistically outperforms the state-of-the-art gradient-free optimizers by achieving solutions with a better approximation ratio.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In reliability analysis and reliability-based design approach, sensitivity analysis establishes a relation between the variation in random variable parameters and that in reliability. The analysis of sensitivity is also employed to determine key random variables with the greatest contribution to reliability. The sensitivity analysis of a non-linear limit state function is relatively complicated and time-consuming. Therefore, a novel approach is proposed in this study to calculate the reliability sensitivity parameter in terms of an interval. In the proposed algorithm, the non-linear limit state function is initially converted to a linear limit state function by the Monte Carlo simulation method. Then, the interval random variables are introduced to include both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties so as to obtain a realistic result. In the second step of the proposed methodology, the mouth-brooding fish algorithm (MBF) is applied to capture the upper and lower bounds of the reliability sensitivity parameters. Several illustrative examples were then presented, showing the capability of the proposed approach in obtaining results accurately and efficiently. According to the results, the percentage of improvement in the sensitivity analysis of random variables in the proposed method, compared to the classical method, by using the MBF optimization algorithm to the parameters of random variables due to the variation Coefficient is more than 40 percents. This means that the length of the response interval has increased.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hybrid energy storage system (HESS), a combination of lithium battery (LIB) and supercapacitor (SC) in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), can slow down the degradation of battery performance and improve the peak current characteristics by using an optimal energy management system (EMS). A fuzzy EMS controller is first designed to allocate the energy between LIB and SC, then an improved NSGA-III algorithm based on similarity and diversity selection (NSGA-III-SD) is proposed to reduce energy consumption, lithium battery output current, peak power and prolong the life of LIB as well as to meet the SOC of SC constraint by optimizing the parameters of the fuzzy rule base and membership functions (MFs). Four typical driving patterns including busy city, urban, suburban and highway are selected to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the optimal fuzzy EMS exhibits good adaptive power distribution capability under all driving conditions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB There are some risks in renewable energy investments, such as legal, technology and financial issues. Hence, appropriate actions should be taken to minimize these risks. However, each of the measures to be taken for the management of risks creates new costs for businesses. Therefore, to ensure the financial sustainability of the projects, measures for the most important risks should be taken at the first stage. Because of this situation, it is vital to make a priority analysis for the risks faced by renewable energy projects so that it can be possible to increase the effectiveness of risk management. Accordingly, in this study, it is aimed to examine the risks and rewards regarding sustainable investment decisions for renewable energy projects. In this scope, a novel model is generated by integrating different techniques. In this process, the evaluations of six different experts are taken into consideration. First, missing evaluations for the sustainable investment decisions in renewable energy are estimated with neuro decision-making and collaborative filtering. Secondly, the weights of the risk factors of sustainable energy investments are computed with neuro quantum spherical fuzzy (QNSLF) DEMATEL with golden cut. Thirdly, reward alternatives for sustainable decision making are analyzed with Neuro QNSLF TOPSIS with golden cut. This study contributes to literature by determining the most important risks for renewable energy projects by an original decision-making model. Another important novelty of this study is that a new technique called neuro decision-making has also been developed. In this technique, the facial expressions of the experts who evaluate are taken into consideration. It is defined that technological changes have the greatest significance. Additionally, governmental incentives are found as the most essential reward to improve sustainable investments in renewable energy. Thus, for the effective management of these risks, appropriate actions should be taken. It is also obvious that the competitiveness of companies that fall behind this new technology will decrease. In this context, these enterprises need to take the necessary measures to manage the technology risk to be sustainable in the long term.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Bayesian evolutionary optimization for crafting high-quality adversarial

DE Adversarial attack; Black-box; Query; Bayesian evolutionary optimization
AB Due to the importance of security, the adversarial attack has become an increasingly popular area for deep learning, especially the black-box adversarial attack, which can only obtain the input and output of the target model, resulting in closer to the real world. Query-based methods are a common strategy for performing black-box attacks, and they can find a slight perturbation to make target model misclassify by continuously querying the target model to obtain the output of the target model. However, query-based methods usually suffer from a serious flaw that needs massive queries, which is unaccepted in the real world. Although some query-efficient methods have been proposed to alleviate the above problems, they greatly sacrifice the quality of adversarial examples due to their problem formulations. To generate high-quality adversarial examples with a limited query budget, we propose a Bayesian evolutionary optimization (BEO) based black-box attack method using differential evolution, where a Gaussian processes model is employed to approximate the real objective function. As a key component of the BEO, we use seven acquisition functions to sample the new solution to update the Gaussian processes model, and an information entropy based selection strategy is proposed to adaptively choose the acquisition function. Finally, an effectiveness validation study is carried out comparing the proposed method with five other black-box attack methods and one Bayesian optimization (BO) method using the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively generate adversarial examples using only 200 queries. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The prohibitive cost of acquiring data from full-scale train collision experiments limits the applicability of data-driven machine learning methods in train collision simulation. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) attempt to address this challenge by incorporating physics equations as part of the loss function construction. However, the PINN approach is relatively time-consuming when it comes to solving a large number of physical equations. In this paper, a parallel physics-informed neural network (PPINN) methodology is developed for the solution of multibody dynamics equations to further reduce the computational cost. As well, a PPINN-based framework for engineering applications is proposed, investigating the dynamic responses, absorbed energy, collision forces, and wheel vertical rises of the full-scale train collision. Automatic differentiation and parallelization algorithms are applied to the multi-body dynamic equations including mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, as well as the. The residuals and the initial conditions are included in the loss function. The dynamic responses, absorbed energy, collision forces, and wheel vertical rise of the full-scale train collision are simulated and studied in detail. The results obtained from the PPINN method are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the finite element method (FEM), Newmark-& beta;, and fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods for all four train collision scenarios. Additionally, the PPINN methodology keeps better stability even under large time steps which implies a big potential for computational cost reduction. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Privileged information learning is proposed to construct the classifier by incorporating privileged knowledge. At present, most of the privileged information learning methods assume that the instance is accurately labeled. However, in real-world applications, an instance may be weakly labeled. In this paper, we propose a novel privileged information learning method with weak labels (PLWB). The hypothesis of our work is that an instance may be annotated by a number of labelers and different labelers may give different labels to this instance due to distinct professional knowledge and subjective factors. It leads to ambiguous labels of instances, namely weak labels. To solve this problem, our methodology is to give each labeler a weight and incorporate these weights into a privileged information learning model. Our technique is to employ a heuristic framework to optimize the labeler weights and the privileged information learning model jointly. The existing privileged information learning methods do not consider the weak label problem, and assign an equal or random weight to each labeler. Our work is different from these methods. The novelty and theoretical contribution is that this is the first work to deal with the weak label problem in privileged information learning. The merit is that we assign an unknown weight to each labeler and solve the optimal values of these weights in the optimization process, such that the performance of the learning model can be improved with the optimal labeler weights. In the experiments, the tool that we use is MATLAB, in which we implement our algorithm. The experimental datasets include one handwritten categorization dataset, two image classification datasets (i.e., Animals-with-Attributes dataset and Caltech-101 dataset), and one disease diagnosis dataset (i.e., Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset), in which the number of instances used is 2000, 6180, 8677 and 202, respectively. The obtained results are that: (1) by optimizing the labeler weights, the proposed PLWB method obtains explicitly higher classification accuracy than the existing privileged information learning methods; (2) PLWB has relatively higher training time since it needs to solve the labeler weights in the optimization process.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over the last decade, China's Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending industry has been seen as an important credit source but it has recently suffered from a wave of bankruptcies. Using 126,090 P2P loan deals from RenRen Dai, one of the biggest online P2P websites in China, this paper attempts to predict credit default probabilities for P2P lending by implementing machine-learning techniques. More specifically, this study proposes a stacking ensemble machine-learning model to assess credit default risk for P2P lending platforms. A Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (MRMR) method is used for feature selection and then irrelevant features are eliminated by using k-means clustering method. Finally, the stacking ensemble model is performed to produce accurate and stable predictions in the feature subset. Experimental results show that stacking ensemble model yields high performance, not only in prediction accuracy but also in precision and recall. In comparison to single classifiers, the stacking ensemble machine-learning model has a minimum error rate and provides more accurate credit default risk prediction. The results also confirm the efficiency of the proposed stacking ensemble model through the area under the ROC curve. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Deep learning; Security; Adversarial example detection; Generalization;
   Decision-making bases; Interpretability; Semantic graph; Attack-agnostic
AB Deep neural networks have recently been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can deceive attacked models with high confidence. This has given rise to significant security threats and raised doubts about the reliability of deploying deep learning models in security-critical domains. Therefore, effectively dealing with various adversarial examples has become an essential but challenging requirement. Adversarial example detection can predict the existence of adversarial examples in advance. However, existing detection methods are usually restricted to specific attacks, lacking generalization and decision-making bases. In this paper, we discover that the common characteristic of adversarial examples is to alter the semantic information recognized by models, which can effectively distinguish adversarial examples and provide interpretability. Based on this perspective, we propose a semantic graph matching (SeMatch) method to execute attack-agnostic adversarial example detection. SeMatch detects adversarial examples by comparing the constructed semantic graphs with the semantic graph prototypes of their predicted classes and further corrects their classification results. Experimental results demonstrate that SeMatch can effectively detect and classify adversarial examples in several attack settings, achieving an average detection and classification accuracy of 96.01% and 89.71%, respectively. When applied to unknown attack scenarios, SeMatch is more effective and interpretable than state-of-the-art methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Sensorless freehand 3D ultrasound (US) reconstruction based on deep networks shows promising advantages, such as large field of view, relatively high resolution, low cost, and ease of use. However, existing methods mainly consider vanilla scan strategies with limited inter-frame variations. These methods thus are degraded on complex but routine scan sequences in clinics. In this context, we propose a novel online learning framework for freehand 3D US reconstruction under complex scan strategies with diverse scanning velocities and poses. First, we devise a motion-weighted training loss in training phase to regularize the scan variation frame-by-frame and better mitigate the negative effects of uneven inter-frame velocity. Second, we effectively drive online learning with local-to-global pseudo supervisions. It mines both the frame-level contextual consistency and the path level similarity constraint to improve the inter-frame transformation estimation. We explore a global adversarial shape before transferring the latent anatomical prior as supervision. Third, we build a feasible differentiable reconstruction approximation to enable the end-to-end optimization of our online learning. Experimental results illustrate that our freehand 3D US reconstruction framework outperformed current methods on two large, simulated datasets and one real dataset. In addition, we applied the proposed framework to clinical scan videos to further validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

DE Hierarchical clustering; Unsupervised learning; Phylogenetic models
ID R PACKAGE; TRAIT EVOLUTION; REGRESSION
AB We propose methods for the analysis of hierarchical clustering that fully use the multi-resolution structure provided by a dendrogram. Specifically, we propose a loss for choosing between clustering methods, a feature importance score and a graphical tool for visualizing the segmentation of features in a dendrogram. Current approaches to these tasks lead to loss of information since they require the user to generate a single partition of the instances by cutting the dendrogram at a specified level. Our proposed methods, instead, use the full structure of the dendrogram. The key insight behind the proposed methods is to view a dendrogram as a phylogeny. This analogy permits the assignment of a feature value to each internal node of a tree through an evolutionary model. Real and simulated datasets provide evidence that our proposed framework has desirable outcomes and gives more insights than state-of-art approaches. We provide an R package that implements our methods. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Better than XML: Towards a lexicographic markup language
SO DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE XML; JSON; YAML; Verbose markup; Data models; Lexicography
AB This article takes a critical look at how XML is used in lexicography and asks the question, why do dictionary entries often end up looking so complex when encoded in XML? The main reason for the perceived complexity of XML-encoded dictionaries is purely structural markup: XML elements which contain other XML elements instead of human-readable text. The overabundance of purely structural markup in lexicography is caused by the nature of lexicographic content, much of which is inherently headed. XML has no support for headedness and neither do other commonly used languages such as JSON and YAML. In this article we propose a number of constraints and extensions to XML, JSON and YAML which add support for headedness into these languages.

AB The sentimental analysis is processed according to structural detection, extraction, quantification, and evaluation of impacts and information present in natural language processing, biometric data, computer-language society, and text analysis. Advanced implementations in data analytics occur, which allows for identifying the underlining trends based on certain efficient computational models. Some of the social and e-commerce platforms consist of numerous reviews regarding the online products that are posted by the end-users. This helps the developers to understand priceless insight during the process of product design. The most significant aim of this work is to develop a Heuristic-based sentimental analysis for E-Commerce data. Here, the pre-processing of input E-Commerce data is performed by blank space removal, stop word removal, and stemming. Here, the statistical features are extracted using Cross Similarity Score (CSS) and Joint Similarity Score (JSS) regarding "positive, negative, and neutral keywords". In addition, the word2vec features are also extracted. From the two sets of features, "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)"is separately used that is named as Optimal Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM (OH-CNN-BiLSTM), and performed the hybridization of two models for the sentimental analysis. The designed CNN-BiLSTM technique is ensured better outcomes when processing long text as it provides advantages through the ability of CNN to extract the features and superiority of Bi-LSTM in learning the bidirectional dependencies of the long-term text. The main novelty of this work is to develop an improved Galactic Swarm Optimization (IGSO) algorithm for improving the hybridized model, as it provides faster convergence when getting the accurate solution on a wide range of dimensional space and is also able to solve the optimization issues with multimodal benchmark data. The evaluation of the suggested algorithm is done with various E-Commerce data and secures high accuracy on sentimental analysis and prediction while comparing with the traditional models.

DE Few-shot segmentation; Organ segmentation; Echocardiography; Medical
   prior knowledge
AB Traditional medical image segmentation methods based on deep learning require experts to provide extensive manual delineations for model training. Few-shot learning aims to reduce the dependence on the scale of training data but usually shows poor generalizability to the new target. The trained model tends to favor the training classes rather than being absolutely class-agnostic. In this work, we propose a novel two-branch segmentation network based on unique medical prior knowledge to alleviate the above problem. Specifically, we explicitly introduce a spatial branch to provide the spatial information of the target. In addition, we build a segmentation branch based on the classical encoder-decoder structure in supervised learning and integrate prototype similarity and spatial information as prior knowledge. To achieve effective information integration, we propose an attention-based fusion module (AF) that enables the content interaction of decoder features and prior knowledge. Experiments on an echocardiography dataset and an abdominal MRI dataset show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, some results are comparable to those of the fully supervised model. The source code is available at github.com/warmestwind/RAPNet.

DE Arbitrary artistic style; Content self-supervised learning; Style
   contrastive learning
AB Arbitrary artistic style transfer has achieved great success with deep neural networks, but it is still difficult for existing methods to tackle the dilemma of content preservation and style translation due to the inherent content-and-style conflict. In this paper, we introduce content self-supervised learning and style contrastive learning to arbitrary style transfer for improved content preservation and style translation, respectively. The former one is based on the assumption that stylization of a geometrically transformed image is perceptually similar to applying the same transformation to the stylized result of the original image. This content self-supervised constraint noticeably improves content consistency before and after style translation, and contributes to reducing noises and artifacts as well. Furthermore, it is especially suitable to video style transfer, due to its ability to promote inter-frame continuity, which is of crucial importance to visual stability of video sequences. For the latter one, we construct a contrastive learning that pull close style representations (Gram matrices) of the same style and push away that of different styles. This brings more accurate style translation and more appealing visual effect. A large number of qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate superiority of our method in improving arbitrary style transfer quality, both for images and videos. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is a primary reason for death among the female population around the world. Early identification can aid in decreasing the mortality rates associated with this disease all over the world. The application of big data in healthcare not only saves lives but also saves time and money. Hospital records, patient medical information, and medical exam results are big data sources in the healthcare sector. In this research, a big data-based two-class (i.e., Benign or Cancer) BC classification model is developed using the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method. The model stages are big data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, classification, and explanations. In the preprocessing step, the data is normalized, and the missing values are replaced. The gorilla troops optimization (GTO) algorithm is employed for the feature selections. Deep reinforcement learning-based Deep Q learning (DQL) is used for the classification, and LIME is used to explain the predicted output. Three different datasets such as WBCD, WDBC, and WPBC from the UCI repository, are used for evaluation. We verify the proposed model against the radial basis function ensemble boosting learning method (RBF-ELB), the Particle Swarm Optimization Multilayer Perceptron (PSO-MLP), and the Genetic Algorithm Multilayer Perceptron (GA-MLP). The results of the experiments show that our method outperforms the traditional methods. The proposed GTO-DQL model achieves 98.90% accuracy for the WBCD dataset, 99.02% for WDBC, and 98.88% for the WPBC dataset, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multiset-valued data is a powerful tool to deal with missing feature values. Classical rough set theory is sensitive to noise in classification learning due to the stringent condition of equivalence relation. Thus, a class of fuzzy relations can be introduced to describe the similarity between samples in multiset-valued data. However, these fuzzy relations have deficiencies when they are used in the computation of fuzzy conditional information entropy. This paper proposes a new model for multiset-valued data by introducing two variable parameters: one controls the similarity between samples, the other dominates the distance between feature values. This model employs the iterative computation strategy to define fuzzy conditional information entropy that is computing by matrix. The notions of three fuzzy information entropies in a multiset-valued decision information system (MVDIS) are put forward. For measuring any added feature, the significance based on fuzzy conditional information entropy is introduced. Moreover, fuzzy conditional information entropy iterative model (FCIEI-model) is presented. Finally, feature selection in an MVDIS based on FCIEI-model and matrix operation is researched, and the relevant algorithm (denoted as FCIEIM-MO algorithm) is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that FCIEIM-MO algorithm possesses good robustness and is superior to some feature selection algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that FCIEIM-MO algorithm possesses good robustness and exhibit better performance compared with some feature selection algorithms.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
AB The range of applications of swarm optimization algorithms is very vast. However, high dimensions and more number of decision variables make these optimization problems more complex. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is the most popular optimizer for performing such types of optimization. PSO is motivated from the movement and intelligence of swarms. However, the primary constraint with the PSO and other swarm algorithms is enormous computational time (CT) due to more number of decision variables in complex problem. The number of steps inside Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (SIAs) also increase the complexity of computation in the process of optimization. Many iterations of the procedure of SIA need more CT since these algorithms are iterative in nature. In this study, a new Global Best-Worst Particle Swarm Optimization (GBWPSO) algorithm has been proposed so as to provide a fully version of parallel algorithm. GBWPSO algorithm is the combination of PSO and Jaya algorithm that provides a refined version of parallel algorithm having more parallelism. The proposed algorithm is executed on three different computational hardware with various combinations of population size and maximum number of iteration on five different standard benchmark functions. The evaluation is done on the basis of performance metrics such as speedup (S), real speedup (RS), maximum speedup (MS), efficiency (E), and scalability. The proposed parallel algorithm (P-GBWPSO) outperforms both parallel version of PSO and Jaya algorithm in terms of less CT and better optimal solution. Based on the results, we found that system 03 (S3) is best on proposed GBWPSO algorithm with an efficiency of 1.2518 compare with system 01 (S1) and system 02 (S2). & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The success of CNNs for various vision tasks has been accompanied by a significant increase in required FLOPs and parameter quantities, which has impeded the deployment of CNNs on devices with limited computing resources and power budgets. Network pruning, which compresses and accelerates CNN models, is an effective solution to this issue. Some studies have considered pruning as a special case of neural network search (NAS) in recent years. However, existing techniques are often computationally complex or prone to sub-optimal pruning results. As such, this paper proposes a novel acceleration method via a 2D Entropy based-Adaptive Filter Search (2EAFS). The importance of corresponding filters, measured by utilizing the amount of information contained in feature maps, is employed as a theoretical guide to simplify the complex exhaustive search process. Information entropy is then normalized layer by layer and the resulting value is used to calculate a layer-wise importance score in a single step. Additionally, a sparse constraint equation is constructed based on the negative correlation between filter pruning rates and the importance of convolutional layers. The Nelder-Mead search algorithm is then adopted to quickly and adaptively determine the optimal pruning architecture. Finally, importance weights are inherited using the pruning rate and 2D entropy and model performance are restored through fine-tuning. Extensive experiments conducted with the CIFAR-10/100, ILSVRC-2012, NWPU-RESISC45 and CUB-200-2011 datasets showed this approach achieved considerable accuracy increases, with significant reductions in FLOPs and required parameters that surpassed current state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin. For example, 2EAFS achieved a 44.1% reduction in FLOPs over ResNet-50, with only a 0.53% Top-5 accuracy decrease for ILSVRC-2012. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB Today's real-world data is frequently significant in size, with many redundant, missing, and noise -based features and data instances must be addressed before applying various data-mining-based algorithms for further knowledge discovery. Excessive dimensionality may be mitigated by carefully excluding unnecessary characteristics and selecting a reasonable subset of features. When presented as an optimization issue, choosing the best clusters using the most suitable subset of attributes is a challenge that may be handled using practical meta-heuristic approaches. Besides this, the automatic finding of the appropriate cluster number is another challenging task for the real-world dataset in the unsupervised machine-learning study. The present work proposes a multi-objective crow search algorithm for clustering and feature selection (MO-CSACFS) by modifying the crow search algorithm and introducing a levy flight-based two-point cross-over mechanism for a better exploration phase of the crow and further making it suitable for multi-objective optimization problems. MO-CSACFS addresses both issues using the three objective functions to find appropriate cluster numbers and features. MO-CSACFS is implemented over several real-life and synthetic datasets with varying instances, features, and cluster numbers to assess the algorithm's performance; apart from that, the present work is also applied over several gene-expression datasets. MO-CSACFS is compared with two similar recently proposed multi-objective optimization processes used over an automatic, unsupervised machine learning task. The results show that the MO-CSACFS has produced a compact and robust cluster comparable to other similar works from the literature. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Feature selection plays a pivotal role in handling today's high-dimensional databases by keeping only the most valuable features, leading to less computation, improved performance, and higher transparency in decision-making processes. Despite the considerable advances in combinatorial optimization, this data-preprocessing step is computationally NP-hard and continues to pose critical challenges, particularly for very high-dimensional (VHD) databases. Here, we propose integer coding and fuzzy granulation (FG) as an integral part of evolutionary wrapper-based feature selection. Based on this integer coding, we further propose crossover and mutation operators that employ set operations such as 'union,' 'intersection,' and 'complement' for higher transparency in their evolutionary explorative and exploitative search processes. In addition to its common use as a surrogate technique to avoid unnecessary computations by recognizing similarities, the fuzzy granulation concept also operates as a repulsive strategy that searches for dissimilarities in the elitist and population initialization routines to reach higher population diversity. An ablation study is implemented to discover the role of individual components of this multi-prong approach. The results are then compared on 22 benchmark problems, ranging from 64 to 138672 attributes, with nine competing methods. Superior performance is shown for the proposed approach in terms of accuracy (in 15 of 22 cases) and achieving a substantially smaller (as much as six times less) feature set with considerably less computational cost (by an average of 30 percent), particularly for VHD feature selection & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID PARTICLE SWARM
AB Artificial neural networks have proved to be useful in a host of demanding applications, there-fore becoming increasingly important in science and engineering. Large-scale problems constitute a challenging task for training neural networks using the stochastic gradient descent method and variations, which are based on the random selection of mini-batches of training points at every iteration. The challenge lies on the mandatory use of diminishing search step sizes in order to retain mild error fluctuations throughout the training set preserving so the quality of the network's generalization capability. Variance counterbalancing was recently proposed as a remedy for addressing the diminishing step sizes in neural network training using stochastic gradient methods. It is based on the concurrent minimization of the average mean squared error of the network along with the error variance over random sets of mini-batches. Also, it promotes the use of advanced optimization algorithms instead of the slowly convergent gradient descent. The present work aims at enriching our understanding of the original variance counterbalancing approach, as well as reformulating it as a multi-objective problem by taking advantage of its bi-objective nature. Experimental analysis reveals the performances of the studied approaches and their competitive edge over the established Adam method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Time series modelling has been successfully handled by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Yet their performance can be severely inhibited by the occurrence of missing values prevalent in many real-life datasets. Many previous studies have been dedicated to imputation methods for generating a complete time series sequence, which have their limitations in terms of imputation bias and inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM model incorporating policy gradient (PG) based reinforcement learning called PG-LSTM, which can mitigate the effect of missing data and capture time-based input feature patterns more effectively to improve prediction performance. Inspired by numerous sequence models' successes in improving the efficiency of processing language data by skipping irrelevant tokens, the PG-LSTM introduces dynamic skip connections between LSTM cell states for time series data for classification and regression tasks for the first time. Specifically, the proposed model comprises a modified LSTM cell architecture that can internally call a policy-based reinforcement learning agent to generate a skipping action, allowing the model to dynamically select the optimal subset of hidden and cell states from past states to capture periodic and non-periodic patterns within a time series sequence. Moreover, the PG-LSTM also designs a lightweight imputation layer using a simple missing value imputation strategy while incorporating missing indicators and skipping segments of unimportant data to reduce the limitations associated with imputed data for handling missing values. Our experimental results on regression and classification tasks on time series data with high rates of missing values demonstrate that the PG-LSTM improves performance against current gated recurrent neural networks (RNN) and conventional non-neural network algorithms. The PG-LSTM can enhance AUC by up to 18.5% in the classification task and RMSE by up to 19.3% in the regression task over gated RNN models, respectively. Our findings are also statistically analysed using statistical significance testing with post hoc analysis.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEARING
AB Fault diagnosis is of great importance for the intelligent health management of mechanical systems. For engineering applications, it is very difficult to collect and label vibration signals corresponding to machine faults. Due to the complicated operational environment, moreover, useful and critical features are often covered by surrounding noise. For those reasons, a multiscale reduction clustering (MRC) method is proposed for the unsupervised diagnosis of machine faults. In the present approach, vibration signals were collected to generate multiscale convolutional representation through a one-dimensional convolutional neural network without prior knowledge of signal processing techniques. Chosen by a convolutional encoder, the dimensionality of the multiscale convolutional representation was reduced for improving the clustering capability. During this dimensionality reduction, a loss function was proposed to optimize the network and speed up the convergence of the diagnostics. The proposed method was evaluated by two benchmark datasets and an experimental setup. With the present method, the clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information for three datasets are all over 0.91 and 0.82, respectively. Results show that the addressed MRC has superior diagnosis ability under the unsupervised fashion compared to other state-of-the-art models. It is proved that MRC is robust for the diagnosis tasks under different working conditions.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dynamic multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithms (DMOEAs) have attracted increasing attention due to their superior performance in real-world applications. It is challenging to rapidly track the changing Pareto set (PS) and Pareto front (PF) in DMOEAs. However, most existing studies only focus on the position change in the PS. To address this problem, we define a series of new PS region changes. Based on these definitions, we propose a dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on two-stage dimensionality reduction and a region Gauss adaptation prediction strategy (DRPS). Specifically, we estimate the possible type of PS changes at the next moment by processing historical information. Afterward, the basic scaling population PSB is generated by dimensionality reduction, while parameters including the scaling factor and density change rate are calculated. Combining these parameters with a Gaussian distribution, the algorithm adaptively adjusts the sampling probability of individuals in PSB, achieving prediction with different types of PS changes. We conducted extensive experiments and compared classical algorithms, the latest algorithms, and algorithms with the same type in 25 test functions. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms in most cases, while implying that the newly defined PS region change is reasonable.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Demand forecast is a relevant topic for retailers to manage effectively inventories comprising a wide range of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) at store level. While this disaggregated forecast problem is central to ensure profitability as it supports accurate inventory decisions, thus avoiding either outof-stock events or overstocks and inventory losses, it is also very complex due to aspects such as the large number of stores and products of modern retailers, the complex marketing and promotional strategies that impact customer demand together with cross-product effects that are all difficult to model. In this study, we propose more effective methods to handle these aspects. More specifically, we employ XGBoost, a non-linear non-parametric ensemble-based model, as the central learning algorithm and a structural change correction method to account for sudden changes in consumer behavior caused by external factors. Our approach also encompasses data cleansing procedures to correct sales observations during out-of-stock days as well as discrepancies between logical and physical inventory counts. Based on real data from a public dataset of a large retailer, we show that our methods outperform the Base-Lift model, a widely used benchmark model for retail forecasting, yielding significant improvements in accuracy metrics together with reductions in stockouts and in stock on hand. The proposed approach has also a high degree of automation, an important requirement for modern retailers.

AB Decomposition-based many-objective evolutionary algorithms decompose the objective space into multiple subregions, with the help of a set of predefined reference vectors. These vectors serve to guide coevolution between subproblems, and while they show potential for maintaining the diversity of solutions, they have limited exploration capabilities in complex problems and high-dimensional objective space. The main issue is that the predefined reference vectors cannot maintain uniformity of the intersection points between search directions and the irregular Pareto front (PF). To address this problem, this paper proposes a dynamical decomposition and selection strategy (DDS). In DDS, the predefined reference vectors are replaced by solutions themselves and normal-boundary directions (NBI), which guide the population to automatically adapt to the shape of PF. The subregions adapt to divide the objective space to increase diversity. Then, to adjust the relationship between diversity and convergence, a dynamical selection strategy based on the course of evolution is proposed. The process of dynamical decomposition and selection strategy is repeated until the termination condition is met. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art many-objective optimization algorithms on several benchmark problems with 5 to 15 objectives in evolutionary computation. Experimental results show that it outperforms other algorithms in most test instances and is less sensitive to irregular PFs. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-node offshore wind speed forecasting is a challenging task due to the complex dynamic spatial dependencies and highly nonlinear temporal dynamics present in the ocean. As deep learning advances, graph neural networks (GNNs) have great potential to capture spatial dependencies in ocean meteorology. However, existing GNN models usually use predefined or learned static graphs. They lack the ability to model dynamic spatial associations, which can limit the performance of GNNs. In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive spatio-temporal graph neural network (DASTGN) that uses dynamic graph convolution (DGCN) to capture dynamic spatial dependencies in offshore wind speed data. Based on the assumption that not only long-term static associations but also short-term dynamic associations exist in the spatial domain and that the importance of these two associations is different, we propose a dynamic adaptive graph generation module to generate static and dynamic graphs to model these two associations. Meanwhile, a matrix fusion mechanism is proposed to fuse them into the optimal dynamic graph, which is fed into the DGCN module. We employ a temporal convolution module to capture the nonlinear temporal dependencies. Finally, the above modules are integrated into a dedicated spatio-temporal convolution module to predict wind speed. Extensive experiments on real wind speed datasets in Chinese seas showed that the DASTGN improved the performance of the optimal baseline model by 3.05% and 3.69% in terms of the MAE and RMSE, respectively. To demonstrate that the DASTGN can effectively model dynamic spatial associations, the generated graph structure is visualized and analyzed. Finally, we present policy implications aimed at enhancing the security of the power system.

ID DIVISION-OF-LABOR; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; MODEL
AB The complexity of industrial processes has grown exponentially, with high degrees of dependency, non-linearity, imprecision, among other aspects, which motivates the interest in developing distributed control systems for their management. In this sense, this work proposes a bio-inspired distributed control approach, where control actions emerge from the component interactions. The distributed control approach is based on the response threshold model to solve the control problem by imitating the behavior of ants. Particularly, our approach is inspired by the way as the ants carry out the division of labor in a colony. Thus, our control approach based on the threshold response model refers to the possibility of reacting to stimuli associated with the distributed control tasks. It has the ability to stabilize the process in the presence of abrupt/successive changes and various initial conditions, with a minimum effort of the actuators to achieve the objectives. Also, it has shown its versatility in different operational contexts with the same parameter tuning. The bio-inspired control approach is proved in a quadruple tank process, a complex system due to its multivariate nature. In this way, our paper introduces a new domain of application of the response threshold model in industrial processes. Several experiments were carried out in different contexts to evaluate its stability, robustness, etc., and compare it with other similar works. In general, the control performance metrics show satisfactory results, which reflects its ability to adapt to changes in the dynamics of the process, which encourages additional studies.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID VEHICLE EMISSIONS
AB Improper traffic signal control will lead to long delays for vehicles and produce massive carbon emissions. The vast vehicle exhaust emissions will pollute the environment and exacerbate the earth's greenhouse effect. Intersection signal optimization tends to start from the traditional view of improving traffic efficiency but ignores the perspective of reducing vehicle carbon emissions. Under the framework of a deep reinforcement learning strategy, this study proposes a novel signal control method to minimize the carbon emissions of vehicles at the intersection. To associate with carbon emissions and signal control plans, the method employs the negative value of vehicle's carbon dioxide emissions as the reward and takes the feature vectors at different time points in the two decision action intervals as the state features. The fully connected neural network, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory network are respectively adopted to extract the state features of the decision-making period and compare their Q-value estimation effects. Through the SUMO simulation platform, the proposed signal control method is comprehensively evaluated and compared with different baseline models. It has been proved that the proposed signal control approach can not only directly reduce vehicle carbon emissions but also improve the operational efficiency of the intersection.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are proposed to handle constrained multi-objective optimization problems. Nevertheless, they often fail to appropriately balance feasibility, convergence and diversity of the population. This paper proposed a dynamic dual-population co-evolution multi -objective evolutionary algorithm (DDCMEA) to solve this issue. In DDCMEA, a dynamic dual-population co-evolution strategy is employed to balance the convergence and the feasibility by dynamically adjusting the offspring number of the two populations. In the early stage of evolution, the algorithm mainly focuses on the convergence and more offspring of the first population are generated. In the late stage of evolution, the algorithm mainly focuses on the feasibility and more offspring of the second population are generated. Finally, feasible solutions with good convergence could be obtained. To further enhance the diversity of the offspring and obtain feasible solutions with a wide spread of distribution, the evolution operators of the genetic algorithm and the differential evolution are chosen as the search engines for the first population and the second population, respectively. The performance of DDCMEA is further tested through thirty-one bench-mark test problems and two real-world problems in comparison with other five state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show the proposed algorithm DDCMEA achieves competitive performance when handling constrained multi-objective optimization problems. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cooperative coevolutionary algorithms have been developed for large-scale dynamic optimization problems via divide-and-conquer mechanisms. Interacting decision variables are divided into the same subproblem for optimization. Their performance greatly depends on problem decomposition and response abilities to environmental changes. However, existing algorithms usually adopt offline decomposition and hence are insufficient to adapt to changes in the underlying interaction structure of decision variables. Quick online decomposition then becomes a crucial issue, along with solution reconstruction for new subproblems. This paper proposes incremental particle swarm optimization to address the two issues. In the proposed method, the incremental differential grouping obtains accurate groupings by iteratively performing edge contractions on the interaction graph of historical groups. A recombination-based sampling strategy is developed to generate high-quality solutions from historical solutions for new subproblems. In order to coordinate with the multimodal property of the problem, swarms are restarted after convergence to search for multiple high-quality solutions. Experimental results on problem instances up to 1000-D show the superiority of the proposed method to state-of -the-art algorithms in terms of solution optimality. The incremental differential grouping can obtain accurate groupings using less function evaluations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Customer satisfaction is crucially affected by energy consumption in mobile devices. One of the most energy-consuming parts of an application is images. This paper, first, investigates that there is a correlation between energy consumption and image quality as well as image file size. Therefore, these two can be considered as a proxy for energy consumption. In the next step, we focused on proposing a multi-objective strategy to enhance image quality and reduce image file size based on the quantisation table (QT) in JPEG image compression. To this end, we have used two general multi-objective approaches: scalarisation and Pareto-based. In this paper, we embed our strategy into five scalarisation algorithms, including energy-aware multi-objective genetic algorithm (EnMOGA), energy-aware multi-objective particle swarm optimisation (EnMOPSO), energy-aware multi-objective differential evolution (EnMODE), energy-aware multi-objective evolutionary strategy (EnMOES), and energy-aware multi-objective pattern search (EnMOPS). Also, two Pareto-based methods, including a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and a reference-point-based NSGA-II (NSGA-III) are used for the embedding scheme, and two Pareto-based algorithms, EnNSGAII and EnNSGAIII, are presented. With our proposed scalarisation method, user's preferences can be set before starting the optimisation process and the algorithm generates only one solution based on the preference, while our Pareto-based approaches generate a set of solutions so that a user can select one of the preferred solutions after the optimisation process. Experimental studies show that the performance of the baseline algorithm is improved by em-bedding the proposed strategy into metaheuristic algorithms. In particular, EnMOGA, EnMOPS, and EnNSGA-II can perform competitively, among others. From the results, the baseline algorithm in all cases and in comparison to all algorithms yields the worst results. Among the scalarisation methods, EnMOGA and EnMOPS can achieve the first rank in 6 and 7 out of 13 cases and the second rank in 7 and 5 cases in terms of objective function. Also, EnMOES achieved the fifth or worst rank among the scalarisation algorithms. Regarding the Pareto-based algorithms, the table shows that EnNSGAII outperforms EnNSGAIII in 10 out of 13 cases in terms of hyper-volume measure, while it fails in 3 cases. Furthermore, we statistically verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness based on the Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of the parameters is provided.

AB Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has experienced rapid progress in recent years due to the develop-ment of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and quantum simulators. Two key elements must be minimized To maintain acceptable computational complexity in QML: the number of qubits required to encode classical data and the number of quantum gates. This paper proposes a novel angle encoding with learnable rotation to drastically reduce the qubits and circuit depth from O(N) to O( left ceiling log2(N) right ceiling ) qubits, and only N parameterized gates, where N is the input size. Additionally, an extended quantum convolutional layer is introduced with multiple quantum circuits (quantum kernel) that allow for the configuration of any arbitrary size, stride, and dilation analogous to a classical convolutional layer. The proposed quantum convolutional layer learns multiple feature maps with a single quantum kernel while reducing computational cost by employing angle encoding with learnable rotation. Extensive experiments were performed by comparing diverse types of quantum convolutional configurations in a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) over a balanced subset of the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, achieving an accuracy of 0.90 and 0.7850, respectively.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent times, Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) have been widely adopted to different tasks in machine learning such as Combinatorial Optimization and Supervised Learning. With the growing interest, it is pertinent to study the boundaries of the classical simulation of VQCs to effectively benchmark the algorithms. Classically simulating VQCs can also provide the quantum algorithms with a better initialization reducing the amount of quantum resources needed to train the algorithm. Even though Matrix Product State representations have been extensively used for quantum state approximation, their capacity is limited in simulating quantum circuits due to the exponential complexity in circuit depth. This manuscript proposes an algorithm that compresses the quantum state within a circuit using a noisy tensor ring representation which allows for the implementation of VQC based algorithms on a classical simulator at a fraction of the usual storage and computational complexity. Using the tensor ring approximation of the input quantum state, we propose a method that applies the parametrized unitary operations while retaining the low-rank structure of the tensor ring corresponding to the transformed quantum state, providing an exponential improvement of storage and computational time in the number of qubits and layers. This approximation is used to implement the tensor ring VQC (TRVQC) for the task of supervised learning on Iris and MNIST datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method compared with the implementations from classical simulator using Matrix Product States (MPS). TRVQC has a test accuracy of 82.63% compared to the benchmark of 83.68% on Iris dataset whereas the former outperforms the latter on a reduced MNIST dataset with TRVQC having an accuracy of 83.73% compared to the benchmark 81.02%, showcasing the comparable performance of the proposed algorithm with the MPS framework. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID COMMUNITY STRUCTURE
AB Globalization influences the frequency and severity of localized traditional patterns of crime in addition to creating conditions for new types of crime. The scope and makeup of traditional crime have been significantly impacted by the world's compression. This makes it impossible for law enforcement officials to examine crime reports for the purpose of conducting investigations and taking the necessary preventive measures. Clustering facilitates investigations by grouping crime reports into different categories based on the crime types. In the proposed work, the crime reports are preprocessed and embedded with the help of the BERT model to capture the contextual meaning of the reports. An undirected graph is constructed considering each crime report vector as a node where an edge exists between a pair of nodes only if the cosine similarity between them is more than a threshold value. The constructed graph is partitioned based on the concepts of node betweenness, edge connectivity, and two proposed concepts, namely, cut of a node, and safe node, introduced in the paper. Based on the edge connectivity of the graph, we decide whether the graph needs to be further partitioned or not. If edge connectivity is high, we consider the graph as a cluster; otherwise, we partition the graph with the help of a node, say v, with the highest node betweenness. During partition, we find the cut of v to determine whether v is safe or not. If v is safe, the algorithm provides two overlapping subgraphs of the graph; on the other hand, if it is not safe, then the algorithm provides a modified graph with a replica of node v. The algorithm is iterative in nature and terminates when all subgraphs are of higher edge connectivity. As the generated subgraphs are overlapped in nature, a novel graph theory-based fuzzification technique is utilized to measure the membership value of each node in different subgraphs, which allows investigators to focus on the most serious crimes in the reports. The proposed method is assessed using crime report datasets as well as other text datasets and compared with several state-of-the-art methods by utilizing a variety of performance metrics to reflect the effectiveness of the method in different domains. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Aiming at the limitation of Hamiltonian neural network in high-dimensional data processing with nonobservable physical quantity system, an embedded Hamiltonian dynamic evolutionary neural network model (EHDN) is proposed in this paper. First, the dynamic physical quantities of high dimensional nonlinear systems are represented by constructing Hamiltonian functions. Then a symplectic integrator is designed to realize the time-varying evolution of network features based on Hamiltonian regular equation and variational numerical integration. Finally, the Hamiltonian dynamic evolutionary neural network is embedded in the convolutional neural network (CNN) to realize the Hamiltonian simulation evolution of convolutional features. Experimental results on two different datasets, CIFAR and FashionMnist, show that compared with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, EHDN model can combine the advantages of Hamiltonian dynamics and convolutional network to improve the recognition accuracy and training stability in high-dimensional image classification tasks. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ATTENTION; HISTOGRAM
AB In facial expression recognition (FER), global and local features obtained from the same face may have different recognition accuracy, indicating that they have different advantages in recognition. Existing FER works usually focus on extracting and fusing global and local features to obtain better recognition results. Instead of evaluating the advantages of global and local features before fusion, these methods default to fusing them in the same proportion, which probably leads to mutual suppression of information representation between the two features, and then causes worse recognition ability and scene adaptability. To overcome this weakness, this paper proposes a multi-task joint learning network with a constraint fusion (called CFNet). To leverage the key features extracted from different tasks, CFNet adopts a multi-loss mechanism and a constraint fusion method to automatically assign corresponding weights based on the importance of global and local facial information. Compared with existing models that employ the direct fusion strategy, CFNet has better adaptability for FER in complex scenes. Extensive evaluations show the superior effectiveness of CFNet over state-of-the-art methods on real-world emotion datasets. Specifically, the accuracy scores of CFNet on CK+, MMI, and RAF-DB datasets are 99.07%, 84.62%, and 87.52%, respectively. The robustness of CFNet is also verified in noisy and blurred scenes.& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes a trend-oriented time series granulation method to transform a long numerical time series into a relatively short granular time series which is consist of a group of unequal-size linear fuzzy information granules (LFIG). The transformed granular time series not only captures the main characteristics like trends and fluctuations of the original time series, but also saves the amount of calculation in time series clustering. Inspired by the distance measure of two equal-size LFIGs and the dynamic time warping, this paper also defines the distance measures for two unequal-size LFIGs and two LFIG time series. Based on such distance measures, the k-medoids method is employed to cluster the datasets coming from UCR time-series database. The clustering performance expressed in terms of computing time and the Rand Index demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed time series granulation method and distance measurement. The main original aspects of this study concern the granular representation of time series with unequal-size granules, and the distance measurement of unequal-length granular time series.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB With the increasing demand for energy in the world today, wind energy has turned out to be an attractive alternative to traditional fossil energy sources because of the characteristics of being clean, non-polluting, and easily accessible. Reliably predicting wind power is vital to improving energy utilization and ensuring the stability of power system operation. However, because of the uncertainty and instability of wind energy, accurately predicting wind power is still challenging. Therefore, this study proposes an Inception-embedded attention memory fully-connected network short-term wind power prediction model, incorporating improved attention mechanisms. As a result, the Inception embedded attention memory fully-connected network can give reliable wind power predictions. This study utilizes a dataset of about 400 days from Natal and compares the Inception-embedded attention memory fully-connected network with 23 algorithms including EffiientNet, NasNet, and ResNet. The comparison results show that the Inception-embedded attention memory fully-connected network obtains reliable wind power prediction one day ahead and outperforms all other compared algorithms by more than 40% in all evaluation metrics. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The search for clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels has been a major effort by researchers all over the world. Wind energy is one of the most optimal choices because of its cleanliness and renewability. However, the existence of the wake effect leads to a decrease in conversion efficiency. Finding the best wind turbine layout has become an important factor in the wind power generation system. Inspired by the excellent optimization capability of meta-heuristic algorithms, they are increasingly applied to solve complex constraints and design objectives in the wind farm layout optimization problems. It is reported that LSHADE, which is an advanced variant of differential evolution, provides a more efficient configuration of wind turbines than other meta-heuristic algorithms. This motivates us to conduct research in this direction and design an effective meta-heuristic algorithm with a chaotic local search strategy and an enhanced memory storage mechanism, which contributes to the reduction of global carbon emissions. The proposed new algorithm is called CLSHADE. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified by the simulation of different constraints and wind field distribution profiles. Compared to four state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithms, the average conversion rate of the proposed algorithm is 92.87%, 89.13%, and 96.86% for three wind distribution profiles, respectively. The results show that the proposed algorithm has superiorities and effectiveness in wind farm layout optimization.

AB With the Internet's popularity and the economy's rapid development, e-commerce has entered a whole new era in China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting intelligent engineering B2B platforms and develop an indicator system based on the theory of resource complementarity. In addition, this study used a combination of qualitative and quantitative research to calculate the weights. We used the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory and Analytic Network Process (fuzzy DANP) method to determine the weights of the dimensions and indicators. The Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method ranks the wellknown intelligent engineering B2B platforms in China. The results show that platform transaction volume, relationship stability and durability, and degree of dependence are key elements affecting the platforms. Finally, it is proposed that media and companies can prioritize two aspects of cooperation performance and relationship quality to improve the operational efficiency of both parties. Platforms should pay more attention to three indicators: relationship stability and durability, closeness, and platform traffic increase, to reasonably allocate resources, grasp the development opportunities, attract users to reside, and improve the economic benefits of the companies.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID DIMENSIONALITY
AB Deep representation learning in image classification is an area in computer vision where deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have flourished. Nevertheless, developing an efficient image recognition model for real world applications is a challenging task, since image datasets are characterized by instances with a large amount of noise and redundant information. Thus, it is essential to incorporate an intelligent feature extraction and filtering method in order to create robust and efficient image representations. In this work, we propose a Multi-View-CNN framework which drastically boosts the performance of pre-trained CNN models, such as ResNet and VGG in image classification applications. In this approach different type of views of the same initial image are used in order to extract different types of features utilizing pre-trained CNN models. However, in order to reduce the huge dimensional size of the raw CNN's output features and create a robust image representation, the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimension reduction method is applied. Then, all these extracted feature vectors are concatenated building a final composite feature representation of the initial image dataset. Finally, this augmented feature vector is used for training a linear model (Logistic Regression) in order to perform the final classification tasks. The main findings of this work are summarized as follows. First, the proposed Multi-View-CNN framework managed to drastically increase the performance results of pre-trained CNN models. Second, the incorporation of PCA as a final layer into the main CNN topology, instead of using the classical dimension reduction layer components such as Averaging and Max Pooling operations, managed to significantly improve the performance. The whole implementation code of this framework alongside with the datasets used in our experimental simulations was uploaded to our public GitHub repository to the following link: https://github.com/EmmanuelPintelas/A-Multi-View-CNN-Framework-for-Deep-Representation-Learning-in-Image-Classification.

ID FETAL ECG EXTRACTION; EVOLUTION
AB Metaheuristic algorithms (MAs) have become one of the primary tools for optimization in diverse domains, including non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) extraction. Research reveals that hyperparameters affect the performance of MAs differently to problems, and some algorithms are problem-specific designed and may produce bad results for different problems. Hence, three questions arise, (1) how much can we trust MAs when solving boxed-constrained fECG extraction problems, and (2) which type of MAs are suitable and adequate for fECG extraction? (3) do MAs find acceptable solutions to a problem that does not formulate the problem comprehensively with an imperfect objective function? This paper focuses on these three inquiries and proposes a framework providing an MA-assisted adaptive filter for non-invasive fECG extraction. The proposed framework has three key components: data pre-processing, MA-based adaptive filter, and post-processing. The pre-processing starts to process the signals detected by pregnant women and extract the desired signal by independent component analysis. Such output signals are then passed to a filter and optimized by population -based algorithms, producing an optimal solution. After that, this solution, as filter weights, will be used for signal extraction and be processed by post-processing. Importantly, the proposed framework is user-friendly that can import any MA algorithm to run and disassemble as a separate assisting tool. This work investigated eight classic and disparate MA algorithms on the Abdominal and Direct Fetal ECG Database (ADFECGDB) dataset, offering comprehensive experimental analysis. We infer from the results that the recordings r01, r02, r03, r05, r08, and r09, where the signals are less noisy and can be solved well. While for recordings r04, r07, r06, and r10, the performance can be influenced by hyperparameters for any test algorithms, such as the population size, window size, and other parameters in MAs. Meanwhile, we found that MA may not be the primary target influencing the performance vary. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Graph-based semi-supervised classification is widely used because it effectively exploits the characteristics of unlabeled data. However, the existing methods have a drawback in that they do not account for the inherent noise of the data. Noise in graph data refers to nodes that are isolated from classes and overlapping nodes between different classes. Therefore, neglecting noise can distort the data manifold, leading to over-smoothing and overall performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a noiserobust model called the dynamic shaving label propagation algorithm. Our proposed method comprises three parts: graph construction, noise definition and cutting, and label propagation. First, in the graph construction process, k is determined at the point when reverse nearest neighbors are identified for the most isolated nodes. Second, the noise definition process identifies the nodes classified as noise based on the number and distance of their reverse nearest neighbors. Finally, label propagation is performed dynamically and iteratively by adjusting the noise removal intensity. Using various simulated and realworld datasets, we evaluate the accuracy and noise robustness of the proposed method with those of existing methods to evaluate its effectiveness and applicability. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing alternatives. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Considering the uncertainty of large group decision-making and the limitation of resources, this paper constructs a large group decision-making method with hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) based on limited budget. Firstly, by studying the basic theory of HFLTS, a weighted aggregation model of HFLTS is proposed, which can ensure the minimum weighted distance between aggregated HFLTS and HFLTSs before aggregation. Secondly, a decision makers' weight determination algorithm is proposed by considering the quality of trust sources in the social trust network, which is calculated by the LeaderRank centrality measure. Furthermore, a maximum group consensus level model (MGCM) based on limited budget is constructed, in which the adjustment cost of decision makers is determined by the hesitancy degree in the evaluation and trust out-degree. For the situation of insufficient budget, the order correlation between the alternatives' ranking before and after the budget increase is introduced to judge whether to increase the budget to achieve a higher group consensus level. Then, a limited budget-based large group decision-making method with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information is proposed. And this method is applied to the selection of equipment suppliers for hydrogen refueling station. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparison with existing research methods and sensitivity analysis.

ID FAILURE MODE; RISK-EVALUATION; TOPSIS; FMEA; QFD
AB Prioritising testing activities is essential for new product development to identify the most valuable tests and distinguish the critical ones from the trivial ones. Most research solves this prioritisation problem based on the high risks identified in Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA). However, an empirical case study on a UK-based engine manufacturer highlights that the aim of testing is not only to detect technical failures but also to validate customer requirements. Based on the findings identified from the empirical study, this paper proposes a systematic approach for testing activity prioritisation, where fuzzy relational decision matrices are established to link customer requirements, technical objectives and testing activities. An XOR Best-Worst Method (BWM) and an extended simple additive weighting (SAW) method are developed to calculate the weights of customer requirements and score the testing activities. The approach also handles two uncertainty scenarios during the prioritisation process, i.e. the subjective judgements of choosing from options and the linguistic vagueness of the decisions. The application in a case from the engine manufacturing company illustrates the methodological improvement in the prioritisation process. The proposed method ranks the testing activities, which suggests an order of effort distribution for the test plan. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main idea is to use mappings to align monolingual representation spaces, using concept compression, to create inter-lingual representations. The proposed approach outperforms traditional cross-lingual retrieval and recommendations methods in experiments conducted on JRC-Acquis and EU bookshop multilingual corpora.

AB Modeling and forecasting of stock indexes is an important and challenging work in the field of financial research, which is of great significance for investors to reduce risk on investment and improve investment returns. However, the basic data of the stock index includes five indicators, namely, opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price and trading volume (COHLV), each of which contains some information related to the future trend. And these indicators are affected by different factors such as politics, economy, psychology and so on, so they have nonlinear, high noise and other complex characteristics. These reasons make the existing methods cannot effectively improve the accuracy of stock index forecasting. In order to solve this problem, we propose a hybrid stock index forecasting model named MEMD-TCN, which is based on multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN). The novelty of the proposed model focuses on decomposition of multivariate time series and using only fully convolutional layers to forecast stock index. The proposed model first uses MEMD to decompose the data of COHLV to obtain subsequences of different fluctuation frequencies of each time series, then inputs subsequences of the same frequency into TCN to predict the subsequences of closing price in the next period. Ultimately, the forecasted values for the closing price are obtained by reconstructing the prediction results of all the subsequences of closing price. To evaluate the performance of the proposed MEMD-TCN model, stock index of several countries that can reflect the overall changes of the market are used. The experimental results verify the notable effectiveness and necessity of the decomposition of multivariate time series. Meanwhile, the results demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed MEMD-TCN model on accuracy and stability.

AB Rough sets (RS) are a set of theories that explore the expression, learning, and induction of incomplete data and inaccurate knowledge. Given the high profile and influence of RS research in the academic world, it is crucial to investigate and summarize the field's development status and knowledge structure. This study employs the main path analysis (MPA) and scientific mapping methods to analyze 2803 retrieved papers and explore the knowledge diffusion and topic evolution in the RS field. The findings suggest that the RS field initially focused on practical applications before transitioning to extended research as the mainstream direction. Two main methods for RS extension research emerged: the constructional method and algebraic (axiomatic) method. Key research topics include neighborhood-based RS, decision-theoretic RS, and covering RS. Scientific mapping reveals six thematic areas across three stages, highlighting the theme distribution and evolution in the RS field. Overall, this paper provides insights into the knowledge structure and conceptual evolution of the RS field by tracing the trajectory of knowledge development and the thematic evolution. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The study of scholar job transfer is beneficial to both individual career success and talent recruitment of institutions. For such a complicated problem, the diversity and objectivity of the obtained information are essentially significant. However, previous works focus on the general job-hopping problems and utilize the information from the recruitment or social platform, which is somehow limited by data privacy. In this paper, we define the scholar job transfer prediction task by introducing more diversified information (e.g., career sequence, collaboration graph), which is obtained from their publications, for more comprehensive modeling without privacy data. Moreover, we design a Multi-channel Multi-tower Enhanced Framework (MMEF) to integrate the heterogeneous inputs in a complementary manner, which can capture the temporal pattern from career trajectories, leverage the academic collaboration information considering the influence from co-authors, and deal with extra descriptions and estimate the relevance scores between the scholars and institutions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework, which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by about 20% overall for making better use of the potential patterns in heterogeneous data. More intensive studies explore how and the degree to different collaborators impact scholar job transfer. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Text classification is a fundamental and central position in natural language processing. There are many solutions to the text classification problem, but few use the semantic combination of multiple perspectives to improve the classification performance. This article proposes a dual-channel attention network model called DCAT, which uses the complementarity between semantics to refine the understanding deficit. Specifically, DCAT first captures the logical semantics of the text through transductive learning and graph structure. Then, at the attention fusion layer (channel), we use logical semantics to perform joint semantic training on other semantics to correct the predictions of unlabeled test data incrementally. Experiments show that DCAT can achieve more accurate classification on a wide range of text classification datasets, which is vital for subsequent text mining tasks.

AB Discovering new user intents based on existing intents from constantly incoming unlabeled data is an important task in many intelligent systems deployed in the real world (e.g., dialogue systems). Since data with new intents are completely unlabeled, most current approaches employ clustering methods to generate pseudo labels to train their models. However, due to intent gaps between existing and new intents, pseudo labels generated by these models are noisy, and prior knowledge from existing intents is not fully utilized. To mitigate these issues, we propose a robust pseudo label training and source domain joint-training network to refine the noisy pseudo labels and make full use of prior knowledge. Experimental results on three intent detection datasets show that our model is more effective and robust than state-of-the-art methods. The code and data are released at https://github.com/Lackel/PTJN.

AB For the fault diagnosis process of petrochemical rotating machinery, it is difficult to accurately identify faults by relying only on dimensionless index methods. Therefore, a fault diagnosis of rotating machinery based on mutual dimensionless index and a convolution neural network is proposed. First, it collects the rotating machinery fault signal of the petrochemical large unit and mutual dimensionless index. Then the sensitivity analysis of mutual dimensionless index is carried out to extract the sensitive features. And then, the sensitive feature samples are mapped to the common subspace of the adversarial network for capacity augmentation. Finally, the sensitive features sample after capacity is input to the convolutional neural network for recognition. Through the verification of the petrochemical experimental platform fault and the wind turbine blade fault, The proposed method has a good diagnosis effect and can adapt to complex on-site conditions.

AB The recent development of Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has revolutionized traditional agriculture with intelligence and automation. In a typical intelligent agriculture (IA) ecosystem, massive and real-time data are generated, analyzed, and sent to the cloud server (CS) for the purpose of addressing complex agricultural issues, such as yield prediction, water feed calculation, and so on. This helps farmer and associated stakeholders to take correct decision that improves the yield and quality of agricultural product. However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics.

AB The development of artificial intelligence plays a significant role of multimedia applications, especially in the healthcare domain. However, it has brought about the problem of sensitive information leakage. To address these challenges, an interesting multimodal fusion-based robust image hiding algorithm is proposed in this article. First, fused image is considered as mark image generated from MRI and CT images using nonsubsampled shearlet transform. Second, we employed principal component analysis to compute the appropriate coefficients of cover image for embedding purpose. Third, fused mark image is Arnold cat map encoded to address the security issue hidden mark media. Finally, the fusion of fractional dual-tree complex wavelet transform and randomized singular value decomposition is utilized to conceal encrypted fused mark media inside host image. Our findings show that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the recent techniques in terms of high robustness and invisibility.

AB Autonomous driving (AD) and Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) hold great promise for transforming mobility. However, current off-the-shelf AD or CDA platforms such as Autoware, Apollo, and CARMA, are subject to gaps between simulation and the real world and do not offer integrated pipelines for CDA research, development, and deployment. In this letter, we conceptualize OpenCDA-ROS, building on the strengths of an open-source framework OpenCDA and the Robot Operating System (ROS), to seamlessly synthesize ROS's real-world deployment capabilities with OpenCDA's mature CDA research framework and simulation-based evaluation to fill the gaps aforementioned. OpenCDA-ROS will leverage the advantages of both ROS and OpenCDA to boost the prototyping and deployment of critical CDA features in both simulation and the real world, particularly for cooperative perception, mapping and digital twinning, cooperative decision-making and motion planning, and smart infrastructure services. By offering seamless integration of simulation and real-world CDA, OpenCDA-ROS contributes significantly to advancing fundamental research, development, testing, validation, prototyping, and deployment of autonomous driving and CDA.

AB Vehicle trajectory prediction plays a vital role in intelligent driving modules and helps intelligent vehicles travel safely and efficiently in complex traffic environments. Several learning-based prediction methods have been developed that accurately identify vehicle behaviour patterns in actual driving data. However, these methods rely on manually curated structured data and are difficult to deploy in intelligent vehicles. In addition, modular information channels that perform vehicle detection, tracking, and prediction tasks encounter error propagation issues and insufficient computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multitask parallel joint framework in which vehicle detection, state assessment, tracking, and trajectory prediction are performed simultaneously according to raw LIDAR data. Specifically, a multiscale bird's eye view (BEV) backbone feature extraction model is proposed and combined with the designed vehicle state identification branch to distinguish dynamic and static vehicles, which is used as a strong prior for trajectory prediction. In addition, a spatiotemporal pyramid model with convolutions and a backbone residual network is used to generate high definition (HD) maps with strong constraints and guidance capabilities, thereby improving the trajectory prediction accuracy. The experimental results on the real-world dataset nuScenes show that the proposed multitask joint framework outperforms state-of-the-art vehicle detection and prediction schemes, including ES3D and PnPNet.

ID MODEL; AVOIDANCE
AB The behavior prediction of the surrounding vehicles is crucial when planning a minimal-risk path when realizing a collision-avoidance system. Herein, we propose a multiple model-based adaptive estimator (MMAE) that infers the lane-change intention of the surrounding vehicles and then predicts their trajectories. Specifically, first, a path is generated in the form of a cubic spline curve using the Frenet coordinate system, which is robust to changes in road curvatures. Linearized recursive least-squares estimation (LRLSE) method is used to adaptively predict a future trajectory based on the past trajectory of the target vehicle. Preview time is defined as a time-varying parameter that determines the final point of the path, and LRLSE updates it in real time. The MMAE applies LRLSEs to multiple paths and obtains the mode probability for each path, then the lane-change intention is inferred using the mode probability and preview time. The predicted future trajectory is the cubic spline curve determined based on the preview time. Further, we verify the performance of our approach using highD, a naturalistic dataset of vehicle trajectories, and compare it with those of existing methods. The proposed method does not require a large amount of data for training and has a low computational burden and high real-time performance.

AB The uncertainties of driver's behavior seriously affect road safety and bring significant challenges to the human-machine cooperative control. This paper proposes a human-machine shared control framework considering driver's time-varying characteristics to improve the co-driving cooperation performance. Firstly, the driving intention is introduced to describe the driver's involvement level through using Gauss-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine method. And the index of driving ability is proposed to evaluate driver skills based on path-tracking errors. Then, a novel human-machine authority allocation strategy is designed by combining the two driving behavior characteristics and used to construct the driver-vehicle interaction system. Subsequently, a T-S fuzzy robust state-feedback shared control system is developed considering time-varying driver behaviors and vehicle states. Finally, the proposed shared steering system is validated by the driver-in-the-loop test bench. The results show that the proposed control method can reduce human-machine conflicts and has obvious superiority in improving performance of driving comfort, path tracking, and vehicle stability for the co-driving vehicles.

AB Facing the requirements of intelligent vehicles for massive data processing, vehicular edge computing (VEC) utilizes computing resources deployed on the roadside infrastructure to provide proximity computing services for vehicles and forms a novel computing paradigm. Thus, vehicles can reduce the burden of local computing and improve computing efficiency by offloading tasks to roadside computing servers or neighboring resource-idle vehicles for execution via cooperative computation offloading (CO). However, dynamic communication channel states and data handover among multiple VEC servers caused by vehicle mobility pose challenges for CO decision-making and data security. This article applies blockchain to the cooperative CO of VEC and thus proposes a cooperative CO and secure handover framework with a consensus mechanism to guarantee the efficiency of cooperative CO and secure handover. In this framework, models for vehicle mobility and cooperative CO handover are constructed, and a consensus mechanism is proposed. This mechanism ensures the synchronization and immutability of offloaded data in the CO handover. A cooperative CO decision optimization is also formulated considering secure handover with blockchain technology to optimize the latency of vehicular computing tasks. To solve this complex problem, this optimization is transformed into a Markov decision process and a cooperative CO decision algorithm with multiagent deep reinforcement learning is designed, thus achieving the optimal solution. Extensive simulations verified the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The tire-road peak adhesion coefficient (TRPAC) is defined as the ratio of the peak adhesion to the vertical load of the tire, which can characterize the ability of a tire to adhere to the road. Reliable TRPAC estimation can not only benefit the vehicle active safety system, but also serve the intelligent transportation system to improve the safety of traffic participants. Considering the problems of low estimation accuracy and poor real-time performance caused by low-quality sensor information in existing TRPAC estimation methods, a TRPAC fusion estimation framework based on the assessment of multisource information quality is proposed in this article. Based on the observability theory of nonlinear systems, a quantitative indicator of dynamic information quality denoted as the excitation level is established. The region of effective excitation is defined as the criterion for starting and stopping the proposed dynamics-based fusion estimator for the longitudinal-lateral coupling condition. Considering occupant comfort and vehicle stability, an active enhancement method based on hierarchical model predictive control is designed to actively improve the excitation level. Based on the receding horizon optimization theory, a dynamics-image-based fusion estimator is proposed to make full use of visual and dynamic information. An adaptive fusion estimation strategy is then proposed to apply the proper estimation working mode according to the multisource information quality. The results of the simulation and vehicle test show that the proposed framework can still perform competitively when the quality of multisource information is poor and achieve reliable TRPAC estimation.

AB Reliable detection and tracking of surrounding objects are indispensable for comprehensive motion prediction and planning of autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitations of individual sensors, the fusion of multiple sensor modalities is required to improve the overall detection capabilities. Additionally, robust motion tracking is essential for reducing the effect of sensor noise and improving state estimation accuracy. The reliability of the autonomous vehicle software becomes even more relevant in complex, adversarial high-speed scenarios at the vehicle handling limits in autonomous racing. In this paper, we present a modular multi-modal sensor fusion and tracking method for high-speed applications. The method is based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and is capable of fusing heterogeneous detection inputs to track surrounding objects consistently. A novel delay compensation approach enables to reduce the influence of the perception software latency and to output an updated object list. It is the first fusion and tracking method validated in high-speed real-world scenarios at the Indy Autonomous Challenge 2021 and the Autonomous Challenge at CES (AC@CES) 2022, proving its robustness and computational efficiency on embedded systems. It does not require any labeled data and achieves position tracking residuals below 0.1 m.

AB Automated vehicles require an efficient fail-safe system for unexpected failures in normal operation. Although existing methods aiming at L4 driving automation leverage conservative motion planning to independently guide fail-safe behaviors when a normal planning function fails, they usually ignore human intervention demands. In fact, manual takeover is still a reliable choice of fail-safe maneuver today. Moreover, human drivers tend to handle critical situations, rather than trust the automated system with the vehicle control. Here, we propose a fail-safe architecture for vehicle behavior and motion planning module incorporating shared control in response to the driver intervention. The proposed method not only estimates driver intention to cooperate with the driver on maneuver selection, but also distributes the driving authority in accordance with the types of achievable minimal risk condition. By using the receding horizon planner with composition planning horizons, the driver is able to obtain an appropriate takeover condition on the basis of safety guarantee. Test in the library of critical scenarios shows that the proposed method is effective in terms of safety and assistance to the driver.

AB Aviation emergency rescue has become one of the most effective means for natural disaster relief due to its flexible and timely characteristics. A reasonable emergency dispatch plan can guarantee the effective implementation of all the rescue measures. Most of previous studies in this area focused on the scheduling and routing but ignored the impact of the specific rescue process, for example the fuel consumption of various helicopters. In this paper, a multi-helicopter-multi-trip Aviation Rescue Routing Problem (ARRP) is analysed which covers the whole rescue process. In addition, a time-domain procedural simulation model is built which can consider different helicopters, refueling or not, various resource locations, multiple disaster sites and other operation factors. Based on that, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) hybridized Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm (GA-LNS) is proposed for optimization. In ARRP, single search algorithm may lead to the local optimum due to complexity. In contrast, the distance greedy strategy and the load ratio strategy are combined in GA-LNS which can fix the local optimum problem. More specifically, based on the helicopter-tagged-task-sequenced chromosome, the single-point crossover operator is used in GA and then, the worst removal strategy and the first/last insertion strategy are adopted in LNS. Finally, the numerical experiments are exercised to verify the effectiveness of the proposed GA-LNS algorithm which is compared with three traditional basic heuristic algorithms and a stateof-the-art memetic algorithm.

ID TRAJECTORY TRACKING CONTROL; SLIDING MODE CONTROL; BY-WIRE SYSTEMS
AB The development of intelligent driving and X-by-wire chassis technology increases the computational complexity and the number of CAN bus-mounted nodes of steering-by-wire vehicles, which leads to non-negligible large random time delay (TD) of the SbW system's control input. TD has a great impact on SbW system's tracking error, which will inevitably deteriorate the safety and yaw stability of vehicles and even cause sideslip accidents. In order to ensure the safety of SbW vehicles, a layered time-delay robust control strategy (LTDRCS) consisting an upper and a lower controller is proposed. Specifically, a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii (L-K) TD H infinity controller (H infinity C) is designed as the lower controller to reduce tracking error, and the system's stability and convergence are synchronously guaranteed by an L-K function and an H infinity norm constraint. As for the upper controller, a novel terminal sliding mode controller (NTSMC) is established to control the yaw rate index and sideslip angle index. In order to restrain the serious influence of the SbW system's inevitable, unknown, and bounded tracking error caused by TD on vehicle yaw stability and ensure the rapid convergence of the system, a novel integral term is introduced. Simulation and experiments show that the proposed strategy efficiently improves the tracking accuracy of the SbW system and the vehicle yaw stability under random TD condition, which benefits from the synergy of the upper and lower layers.

AB Autonomous vehicles equipped with numerous advanced sensors are capable of obtaining road preview information, creating new opportunities for vehicle suspension systems. This article proposes a novel preview suspension control method from adaptive nonlinear control perspectives with less computational burden and is more realistic, unlike optimization-based works or existing linear state-space models-based results that neglected nonlinear terms. The X-shaped bio-inspired dynamics derived from animal or insect skeleton structures are introduced to reduce energy consumption by utilizing beneficial geometrical nonlinearities. Meanwhile, optimal velocity planning approach is investigated to balance vehicle passage time, vibration suppression, and longitudinal comfort by solving a multi-objective optimization problem with the aid of road preview information. Moreover, acceleration constraint reduces the search space and computing requirements, while ensuring planned velocity optimality. Simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the constructed energy-saving adaptive preview control framework with constrained velocity planning.

ID VEHICLE TRACKING
AB LiDAR-basedframeworks combining dynamic occupancy grids and object-level tracking are a popular approach for perception of the environment in autonomous driving applications. This paper presents a novel backchannel from the object-level module to the grid-level module that procures the enhancement of overall performance. This feedback leads to an enhanced grid representation by the inclusion of two new steps that allow semantic classification of the occupied space and the improvement of the dynamic estimation. To this end, objects extracted from the grid are analyzed with respect to potential object classes and displacement. Class likelihoods are filtered over time at cell-level using particles and a naive Bayesian classifier. The displacement information is computed taking into account semantic information and comparing objects in consecutive frames. Then, it is used to obtain velocity measurements that are used to enhance grid's dynamic estimation. In contrast to other approaches in the literature seeking similar objectives, this proposal does not rely on additional sensing technologies or neural networks. The evaluation is conducted with real sensor data in challenging urban scenarios.

ID DESIGN
AB In this article, we address the problem of using non interpretable Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in safety critical applications, especially automated driving functions. We focus on the lane change prediction of vehicles on a highway. In order to understand wrong decisions, which may lead to accidents, we want to interpret the reasons for a ML algorithm's decision making. To this end, we use motif discovery-a data mining method-to obtain sub-sequences representing typical driving behavior. With the help of these meaningful sub-sequences (motifs), we can study typical driving maneuvers on a highway. On top of this, we propose to replace non-interpretable ML algorithms with an interpretable alternative: a Mixture of Experts (MoE) classifier. We present an MoE classifier consisting of different k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers trained only on motifs, which represent a few samples from the dataset. These k-NN-based experts are fully interpretable, making the lane change prediction fully interpretable, too. Using our proposed MoE classifier, we are able to solve the lane change prediction problem in an interpretable manner. These MoE classifiers show a classification performance comparable to common non-interpretable ML methods from the literature.

DE Aspect-based sentiment classification; deep learning; BERT
AB Business customers and consumers share their reviews online on social platforms such as Twitter. Therefore, Twitter data sentiment analysis is extremely useful for both research and commercial purposes. Manually analyzing reviews takes a long time and effort, hence, automatic sentiment analysis is required. In this article, we address aspect-based sentiment analysis for Arabic food delivery reviews using several deep learning approaches. In particular, we propose to use Transformer-based models (GigaBERT and AraBERT), Bi-LSTM-CRF, and LSTM, as well as a classical machine learning algorithm (SVM). We also present our dataset of food delivery service reviews, which we collected from Twitter. We annotated them and used them for training and evaluating our approaches.
   The experiments show that both GigaBERT and AraBERT outperformed the other models in all the tasks. The Transformer-based models received F1-scores of 77% in the aspect terms detection task, 82% in the Aspect category detection task, and 81% in the aspect polarity detection task, gaining 2%, 4%, and 4% over Bi-LSTM-CRF and LSTM in the first, second, and third tasks, respectively.

TI Low-resource Multilingual Neural Translation Using Linguistic

SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ASIAN AND LOW-RESOURCE LANGUAGE INFORMATION

LA English
DT Article
DE Linguistic features; morphology; neural networks
AB This article investigates approaches to effectively harness source-side linguistic features for low-resource multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT). Previous works focus on using various features of a word such as lemma, part-of-speech tag, dependency label, and so on, to improve translation quality in a low-resource scenario. However, these studies deal with bilingual translation and do not focus on using features in multilingual training setups. Our work focuses on this particular point and experiments with low-resource multilingual models incorporating source-side linguistic features. Although techniques for integrating features into an NMT model such as concatenation and feature relevance perform quite well in bilingual settings, they do not work well in multilingual settings. To remedy this, we propose the use of dummy features and language indicator features in MNMT models. Experiments are conducted on English to Asian language translation on a multilingual, multi-parallel corpus spanning English and eight Asian languages where for each language pair, the training data size does not exceed 20,000 parallel sentences. After establishing strong bilingual baselines using feature relevance mechanisms and multilingual baselines without any features, we show that our proposed dummy features and language indicator features, in combination with feature relevance mechanisms, yield significant improvements in BLEU points for all language pairs. We then analyze our models from the perspectives of model sizes, the impact of individual linguistic features, validation perplexity computed during training, visualization of the activations of the relevance mechanisms, and exhaustive tuning of hyperparameters. We also report preliminary results for multilingual multi-way models using linguistic features.

DT Article
DE Event extraction; mask-attention-based transformer; event type markers;
   event ontology
AB Event extraction is an essential but challenging task in information extraction. This task has considerably benefited from pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, when it comes to the trigger-word mismatch problem in languages without natural delimiters, existing methods ignore the complement of lexical information to BERT. In addition, the inherent multi-role noise problem could limit the performance of methods when one sentence contains multiple events. In this article, we propose a Mask-Attention-based BERT (MABERT) framework for Chinese event extraction to address the above problems. Firstly, in order to avoid trigger-word mismatch and integrate lexical features into BERT layers directly, a mask-attention-based transformer augmented with two mask matrices is devised to replace the original one in BERT. By the mask-attention-based transformer, the character sequence interacts with external lexical semantics sufficiently and keeps its structure information at the same time. Moreover, against the multi-role noise problem, we make use of event type information from representation and classification, two aspects to enrich entity features, where type markers and event-schema-based mask matrix are proposed. Experimental results on the widely used ACE2005 dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed MABERT on Chinese event extraction task compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This study examines variation in rhythm metrics in a multilingual setting by focusing on between-speaker differences. The investigation analyzes speech rhythm patterns of segmental durations in the speech of 77 Algerian speakers belonging to three educational background classes and three age groups. The experiment focuses on speech rhythm variability according to the level of educational background of the speakers and the language used in daily life. The gender and age of speakers are also analyzed. Results show that five vocalic rhythm metrics reflect the contrast between long and short vowels that was observed from the acoustic measurements. The statistical analysis reveals that rhythm metrics are sensitive to differences between groups of speakers, such as age and educational background. The outcomes also show that the lack of practice of Modern Standard Arabic by some speaker groups considerably affects vowel quantity.

DE Pre-trained language model; prompt learning; parameter-efficient tuning;
   few-shot learning
AB Prompt learning has emerged as a new paradigm for leveraging pre-trained language models (PLMs) and has shown promising results in downstream tasks with only a slight increase in parameters. However, the current usage of fixed prompts, whether discrete or continuous, assumes that all samples within a task share the same prompt. This assumption may not hold for tasks with diverse samples that require different prompt information. To address this issue, we propose an instance-aware prompt learning method that learns a different prompt for each instance. Specifically, we suppose that each learnable prompt token has a different contribution to different instances, and we learn the contribution by calculating the relevance score between an instance and each prompt token. The contribution-weighted prompt would be instance aware. We apply our method to both unidirectional and bidirectional PLMs on both language understanding and generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable results using as few as 1.5% of the parameters of PLMs tuned and obtains considerable improvements compared with strong baselines. In particular, our method achieves state-of-the-art results using ALBERT-xxlarge-v2 on the SuperGLUE few-shot learning benchmark.(1)

AB In this article, the authors present an effort to recognize handwritten Gurumukhi place names for use in postal automation. Five feature extraction techniques (zoning, horizontal peak extent, vertical peak extent, diagonal, and centroid) have been analyzed and optimized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Four classification methods (k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), decision tree, random forest, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) have been utilized to classify the handwritten word images. To enhance the recognition results, the authors have employed Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) with a majority voting scheme. The authors used a public benchmark dataset of 40,000 handwritten place-name samples in the Punjabi language for their experimental work. The experiments were conducted using a 70:30 partitioning approach, where 70% of the data was utilized for training and the remaining 30% for testing. The system achieved a maximum recognition accuracy of 96.98% by utilizing a combination of zoning, vertical peak extent, and diagonal features, and a minimum Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.86% based on a combination of zoning and horizontal peak extent features with a majority voting scheme through ensemble (Bagging) methodology.

AB Speech dataset is an essential component in building commercial speech applications. However, low-resource languages such as Swahili lack such a resource that is vital for spoken digit recognition. For languages where such resources exist, they are usually insufficient. Thus, pre-training methods have been used with external resources to improve continuous speech recognition. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of pre-training methods specifically for spoken digit recognition. This study aimed at addressing these problems. First, we developed a Swahili spoken digit dataset for Swahili spoken digit recognition. Then, we investigated the effect of cross-lingual and multi-lingual pre-training methods on spoken digit recognition. Finally, we proposed an effective language-independent pre-training method for spoken digit recognition. The proposed method has the advantage of incorporating target language data during the pre-training stage that leads to an optimal solution when using less training data. Experiments on Swahili (being developed), English, and Gujarati datasets show that our method achieves better performance compared with all the baselines listed in this study.

AB Tokenization represents the way of segmenting a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. Since Arabic is an agglutinating language by nature, this treatment becomes a crucial preprocessing step for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as morphological analysis, parsing, machine translation, information extraction, and so on. In this article, we investigate word tokenization task with a rewriting process to rewrite the orthography of the stem. For this task, we are using Tunisian Arabic (TA) text. To the best of the researchers' knowledge, this is the first study that uses TA for word tokenization. Therefore, we start by collecting and preparing various TA corpora from different sources. Then, we present a comparison of three character-based tokenizers based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The best proposed model using CRF achieved an F-measure result of 88.9%.

AB Due to the lack of a large annotated speech corpus, many low-resource Indian languages struggle to utilize recent advancements in deep neural network architectures for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. Collecting large-scale databases is an expensive and time-consuming task. Current approaches lack extensive traditional expert-based data acquisition guidelines, as they are tedious and complex. In this work, we present the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad-Crowd Sourced Telugu Database (IIITH-CSTD), a Telugu corpus collected through crowdsourcing. In particular, our main objective is to mitigate the low-resource problem for Telugu. We also present the sources, crowdsourcing pipeline, and the protocols used to collect the corpus for a low-resource language, namely, Telugu. Data of approximately 2,000 hours of transcribed audio is presented and released in this article, covering three major regional dialects of the Telugu language in three different (i.e., read, conversational and spontaneous) speaking styles on topics such as politics, sports, and arts, science, and so on.(1) We also present the experimental results of the collected corpus on ASR tasks. We hope this work will motivate researchers to curate large-scale annotated speech data for other low-resource Indic languages.

ID WORDS
AB We explore and evaluate the effect of different stopword lists (non-corpus-based and corpus-based) in the information retrieval (IR) tasks with different Indian languages such as Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Hindi, and English. The issue was investigated from three viewpoints. Is there any performance difference between non-corpus-based and corpus-based stopword removal in chosen Indian languages? Can corpus-based stopword lists improve performance in Indian languages IR? If yes, to what extent? Among the different corpus-based stopword lists, which stopword list provides the best IR performance? Does the length of a corpus-based stopword list affect the retrieval performance in Indian languages? If yes, to what extent? It was observed that a corpus-based stopword list provides better retrieval performance than a non-corpus-based stopword list in different Indian languages. Among the different corpus-based stopword lists generated and experimented with, Zipf's law-based stopword list (idf-based one) provides the best retrieval performance in various Indian languages. The aggregation1-based stopword list provides better retrieval than the aggregation2-based list in Indian languages, but in English, the aggregation2-based stopword list performs better than the aggregation1-based list. The best performing idf-based stopword list improves MAP score by 5.43% in Bengali, 1.91% in Marathi, 5.4% in Gujarati, 1.5% in Hindi, and 2.12% in English, respectively, over their baseline counterparts. The probabilistic retrieval models (BM25 and TF-IDF) perform best in different Indian languages. A smaller length of corpus-based stopword lists performs better than a larger length of non-corpus-based stopword lists for all the Indian languages considered. The proposed schemes demonstrate that a stopword list can be heuristically generated in a language-independent statistical method and effectively used for IR tasks with performance comparable, to or even better than non-corpus-based stopword lists.

AB Phishing involves malicious activity whereby phishers, in the disguise of legitimate entities, obtain illegitimate access to the victims' personal and private information, usually through emails. Currently, phishing attacks and threats are being handled effectively through the use of the latest phishing email detection solutions. Most current phishing detection systems assume phishing attacks to be in English, though attacks in other languages are growing. In particular, Arabic is a widely used language and therefore represents a vulnerable target. However, there is a significant shortage of corpora that can be used to develop Arabic phishing detection systems. This article presents the development of a new English-Arabic parallel phishing email corpus that has been developed from the anti-phishing share task text (IWSPA-AP 2018). The email content was to be translated, and the task had been allotted to 10 volunteers who had a university background and were English and Arabic language experts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new corpus, we develop phishing email detection models using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Multilayer Perceptron using 1,258 emails in Arabic and English that have equal ratios of legitimate and phishing emails. The experimental findings show that the accuracy reaches 96.82% for the Arabic dataset and 94.63% for the emails in English, providing some assurance of the potential value of the parallel corpus developed.

AB Sentiment classification is an instrument of natural language processing tasks in text analysis to measure customer feedback from given documents such as product reviews, news, and texts. This research aims to experiment with Thai financial news sentiment classification and evaluate sentiment classification performance. In this research, we show financial news sentiment classification experimental results when comparing supervised and semi-supervised methods. In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language. From this study, we observe the importance of sentiment classification tools between supervised and semi-supervised learning, and we look forward to furthering this work.

AB Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task for information extraction applications. NER is challenging because of semantic ambiguities in academic literature, especially for non-Latin languages. Besides word semantic information, recognizing Chinese named entities needs to consider word boundary information, as words contained in Chinese texts are not separated with spaces. Leveraging word boundary information could help to determine entity boundaries and thus improve entity recognition performance. In this article, we propose to combine word boundary information and semantic information for named entity recognition based on multi-task adversarial learning. Specifically, we learn commonly shared boundary information of entities from multiple kinds of tasks, including Chinese word segmentation (CWS), part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and entity recognition, with adversarial learning. We learn task-specific semantic information of words from these tasks and combine the learned boundary information with the semantic information to improve entity recognition with multi-task learning. We then propose a compression method based on improved clustering to accelerate the proposed model. We conduct extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets and two private datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baseline models, and the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves considerable performance improvements on various evaluation datasets.

ID MODEL
AB Chinese idiom cloze-style reading comprehension task is of great significance for improving the machine's ability to understand Chinese idioms, which is one of the essential application requirements in advanced artificial intelligence. Existing methods suffer from an insufficient deep semantic understanding of the text. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel Retrospective Multi-granularity Fusion Network (RMFNet) for Chinese idiom cloze-style reading comprehension. Our RMFNet is equipped with two novel modules to model deeper contextual information of passage and Chinese idioms, respectively. First, we propose a novel Multi-granularity Passage Fusion (MgPF) module, which enhances the passage representation by integrating different semantic perspectives. Second, we propose a Retrospective Reading (Re-2) module that implements a back-and-forth reading mechanism to concentrate on critical Chinese idioms, thereby generating an ultimate memory for the whole text. Notably, the intuition of the MgPF module and the Re-2 module is based on human reading strategies in the real world. The strategies in these modules are similar to how humans perceive the text. Extensive experiments are conducted on Chinese benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Our RMFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance and in-depth analysis verifies its capability for understanding the deep semantics of the text.

AB To handle emotional expressions in computer applications, Russell's circumplex model has been useful for representing emotions according to valence and arousal. In SentiWordNet, the level of valence is automatically assigned to a large number of synsets (groups of synonyms in WordNet) using semi supervised learning. However, when assigning the level of arousal, the existing method proposed for SentiWordNet reduces the accuracy of sentiment prediction. In this paper, we propose a block segmentation vector for predicting the arousal levels of many synsets from a small number of labeled words using semi-supervised learning. We analyze the distribution of arousal and non-arousal words in a corpus of sentences by comparing it with the distribution of valence words. We address the problem that arousal level prediction fails when arousal and non-arousal words are mixed together in some sentences. To capture the features of such arousal and non-arousal words, we generate word vectors based on inverted indexes by block IDs, where the corpus is divided into blocks in the flow of sentences. In the evaluation experiment, we show that the results of arousal prediction with the block segmentation vectors using semi-supervised learning outperform the results of the previous methods in SentiWordNet and SocialSent.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper proposes a battery data augmentation approach to enrich training data for state-of-charge (SOC) estimation algorithm. The approach is evaluated on battery datasets collected under various conditions to test its effectiveness. Visual comparison and low Kullback-Leibler divergence values prove that synthetic data is indistinguishable from real battery data. The computation results show that the performance of the SOC estimator can be greatly improved by adding synthetic data to the training data, and the accuracy of the estimator is even better than that of our previously proposed advanced white-box method. This data augmentation approach provides a credible way to enrich training data for SOC estimation algorithm and we have confidence that it will further accelerate the development of accurate SOC estimators. The proposed generative method is also an universal method to generate multi-type time series, rather than a method only applicable to battery data augmentation. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   Facial expression recognition
AB Automatic facial expression recognition (AFER), sometimes referred to as emotional recognition, is important for socializing. Automatic methods in the past two years faced challenges due to Covid-19 and the vital wearing of a mask. Machine learning techniques tremendously increase the amount of data processed and achieved good results in such AFER to detect emotions; however, those techniques are not designed for masked faces and thus achieved poor recognition. This paper introduces a hybrid convolutional neural network aided by a local binary pattern to extract features in an accurate way, especially for masked faces. The basic seven emotions classified into anger, happiness, sadness, surprise, contempt, disgust, and fear are to be recognized. The proposed method is applied on two datasets: the first represents CK and CK +, while the second represents M-LFW-FER. Obtained results show that emotion recognition with a face mask achieved an accuracy of 70.76% on three emotions. Results are compared to existing techniques and show significant improvement.

AB The computational complexity of transformers limits it to be widely deployed onto frameworks for visual recognition. Recent work Dosovitskiy et al. 2021 significantly accelerates the network processing speed by reducing the resolution at the beginning of the network, however, it is still hard to be directly generalized onto other downstream tasks e.g.object detection and segmentation like CNN. In this paper, we present a transformer-based architecture retaining both the local and global interactions within the network, and can be transferable to other downstream tasks. The proposed architecture reforms the original full spatial self-attention into pixel-wise local attention and patch-wise global attention. Such factorization saves the computational cost while retaining the information of different granularities, which helps generate multi-scale features required by different tasks. By exploiting the factorized attention, we construct a Separable Transformer (SeT) for visual modeling. Experimental results show that SeT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art transformer-based approaches and its CNN counterparts on three major tasks including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation.(1)

DE Hawkes process; Universal Transformer; Relative positional encoding;
   Convolution enhancing
AB Modeling Hawkes process using deep learning is superior to traditional statistical methods in the goodness of fit. However, methods based on RNN or self-attention are deficient in long-time dependence and recursive induction, respectively. Universal Transformer (UT) is an advanced framework to integrate these two requirements simultaneously due to its continuous transformation of self-attention in the depth of the position. In addition, migration of the UT framework involves the problem of effectively matching Hawkes process modeling. Thus, in this paper, an iterative convolutional enhancing self-attention Hawkes process with time relative position encoding (ICAHP-TR) is proposed, which is based on improved UT. First, the embedding maps from dense layers are carried out on sequences of arrival time points and markers to enrich event representation. Second, the deep network composed of UT extracts hidden historical information from event expression with the characteristics of recursion and the global receptive field. Third, two designed mechanics, including the relative positional encoding on the time step and the convolution enhancing perceptual attention are adopted to avoid losing dependencies between relative and adjacent positions in the Hawkes process. Finally, the hidden historical information is mapped by Dense layers as parameters in Hawkes process intensity function, thereby obtaining the likelihood function as the network loss. The experimental results show that the proposed methods demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic datasets and real-world datasets from the perspective of both the goodness of fit and predictive ability compared with other baseline methods.

DE Class hierarchical structure; Granular computing; Multi-granularity and
   hierarchical classification; Joint optimization
ID EFFICIENT
AB Class hierarchical structures play a significant role in large and complex tasks of machine learning. Existing studies on the construction of such structures follow a two-stage strategy. The category similarities are first computed with a certain assumption, and the group partition algorithm is then performed with some hyper-parameters to control the shape of class hierarchy. Despite their effectiveness in many cases, these methods suffer from two problems: (1) optimizing the two-stage objective to obtain the structure is sub-optimal; (2) hyper-parameters make the search space too large to find the optimal structure efficiently. In this paper, we propose a unified and dynamic framework to address these problems, which can: (1) jointly optimize the category similarity and group partition; (2) obtain the class hierarchical structure dynamically without any hyper-parameters. The framework replaces the traditional category similarity with the sample similarity, and constrains samples from the same atomic category partitioned to the same super-category. We theoretically prove that, within our framework, the sample similarity is equivalent to the category similarity and can balance the partitions in terms of the number of samples. Further, we design a modularity-based partition optimization algorithm that can automatically determine the number of partitions on each level. Extensive experimental results on multiple image classification datasets show that the hierarchical structure constructed by the proposed method achieves better accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Additionally, the hierarchy obtained by the proposed method can benefit long-tail learning scenarios due to the balanced partition on samples.

ID DIGITAL IMAGES; CHALLENGES
AB Forgery detection is one of the challenging subjects in computer vision. Forgery is performed using image manipulation with editor tools. Image manipulation tries to change the concept of the image but preserves the integrity of the texture and structure of the image as much as possible. Images are used as evidence in some applications, so if the images are manipulated, they will not be reliable. The copy-move forgery is one of the simplest image manipulation methods. This method removes or inserts information into the image with the least clue by copying a part of the image and pasting it into other places of the same image. Recently, traditional (block-based and keypoint-based) and deep learning methods have been proposed to detect forgery images. Traditional methods include two main steps, feature extraction, and feature matching. Unlike the traditional methods, the deep learning method performs the forgery detection automatically by extracting hierarchical features directly from the data. This paper presents a deep learning method for forgery detection at both image and pixel levels. In this method, we used a pre-trained deep model with a global average pooling (GAP) layer instead of default fully connected layers to detect forgery. The GAP layer creates a good dependency between the feature maps and the classes. In pixel forgery detection, a visualization technique called heatmap activation is used in forgery images. This technique identifies parts of the image that are candidates for forgery. Then, the best candidate is selected and the location of the forgery is determined. The proposed method is performed on the CoMoFod and MICC datasets. The extensive experiments showed the satisfactory performance of the proposed method.

AB Network compression plays an important role in accelerating deep neural networks, especially in the application of edge devices such as unmanned cars and drones. Recently, pruning-based methods have been improved significantly, but they still suffer from low efficiency because most of them only pay attention to feature similarities in the space domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain structured pruning method based on clustering (MDCP) which seamlessly integrates sufficient information extrac-tion and knowledge distillation within a GAN-based framework, to address these aforementioned limita-tions. Specifically, 1) to exhaustively analyze the features for reasonable pruning, we perform pruning taking both space and frequency information into account, which considering the spectral statistics to produce a more accurate pruning map; 2) to tackle the distance distortion problem caused by feature insufficiency, we further propose a clustering-based measurement mechanism to acquire pruning guid-ance under extreme conditions; 3) to avoid the dependence on labels and fine-tuning in previous works, a generative adversarial mechanism with two label-level losses is introduced, which further ensures the pruning efficiency and accuracy. Such a multi-domain clustering-based framework along with an adver-sarial and contrastive learning pattern significantly improves the pruning quality. Comprehensive exper-iments conducted on four benchmarks demonstrate that our MDCP method performs favorably against existing competitors. Notably, for CIFAR-10 dataset, our method on ResNet-110 outperforms the former state-of-the-art method (94.33%) in terms of top-1 accuracy (94.61%) and achieves a maximum parame-ter pruning rate (73.33%).

AB Accurate and timely diagnosis is a pillar of effective healthcare. However, the challenge lies in gathering extensive training data while maintaining patient privacy. This study introduces a novel approach using federated learning (FL) and a cross-device multimodal model for clinical event classification based on vital signs data. Our architecture employs FL to train several machine learning models including random forest, AdaBoost, and SGD ensemble models on vital signs data. The data were sourced from a diverse clientele at a Boston hospital (MIMIC-IV dataset). The FL structure trains directly on each client's device, ensuring no transfer of sensitive data and preserving patient privacy. The study demonstrates that FL offers a powerful tool for privacy-preserving clinical event classification, with our approach achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.9%. These findings highlight the significant potential of FL and cross-device ensemble technology in healthcare applications, especially in the context of handling large volumes of sensitive patient data.

AB Recent technological advances have enabled the development of sophisticated prosthetic hands, which can help their users to compensate lost motor functions. While research and development has mostly addressed the functional requirements and needs of users of these prostheses, their broader societal perception (e.g., by external observers not affected by limb loss themselves) has not yet been thoroughly explored. To fill this gap, we investigated how the physical design of artificial hands influences the perception by external observers. First, we conducted an online study (n = 42) to explore the emotional response of observers toward three different types of artificial hands. Then, we conducted a lab study (n = 14) to examine the influence of design factors and depth of interaction on perceived trust and usability. Our findings indicate that some design factors directly impact the trust individuals place in the system's capabilities. Furthermore, engaging in deeper physical interactions leads to a more profound understanding of the underlying technology. Thus, our study shows the crucial role of the design features and interaction in shaping the emotions around, trust in, and perceived usability of artificial hands. These factors ultimately impact the overall perception of prosthetic systems and, hence, the acceptance of these technologies in society.

ID PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHM; ERROR
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is being increasingly used to automate and improve technologies within the field of medical imaging. A critical step in the development of an AI algorithm is estimating its prediction error through cross-validation (CV). The use of CV can help prevent overop-timism in AI algorithms and can mitigate certain biases associated with hyperparameter tuning and algorithm selection. This article introduces the principles of CV and provides a practical guide on the use of CV for AI algorithm development in medical imaging. Different CV tech-niques are described, as well as their advantages and disadvantages under different scenarios. Common pitfalls in prediction error estimation and guidance on how to avoid them are also discussed.

TI Conquering the Cobb Angle: A Deep Learning Algorithm for Automated,
   Hardware-Invariant Measurement of Cobb Angle on Radiographs in Patients
   with Scoliosis
SO RADIOLOGY-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Scoliosis is a disease estimated to affect more than 8% of adults in the United States. It is diagnosed with use of radiography by means of manual measurement of the angle between maximally tilted vertebrae on a radiograph (ie, the Cobb angle). However, these measurements are time-consuming, limiting their use in scoliosis surgical planning and postoperative monitoring. In this retrospective study, a pipeline (using the SpineTK architecture) was developed that was trained, validated, and tested on 1310 anterior-posterior images obtained with a low-dose stereo radiographic scanning system and radiographs obtained in patients with suspected scoliosis to automatically measure Cobb angles. The images were obtained at six centers (2005-2020). The algorithm measured Cobb angles on hold-out internal (n = 460) and external (n = 161) test sets with less than 2 & DEG; error (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.96) compared with ground truth measurements by two experienced radiologists. Measurements, produced in less than 0.5 second, did not differ significantly (P = .05 cutoff) from ground truth measurements, regardless of the presence or absence of surgical hardware (P = .80), age (P = .58), sex (P = .83), body mass index (P = .63), scoliosis severity (P = .44), or image type (low-dose stereoradiographic image vs radiograph; P = .51) in the patient. These findings suggest that the algorithm is highly robust across different clinical characteristics. Given its automated, rapid, and accurate measurements, this network may be used for monitoring scoliosis progression in patients.

AB The verticillium fungus has become a widespread threat to olive fields around the world in recent years. The accurate and early detection of the disease at scale could support solving the problem. In this paper, we use the YOLO version 5 model to detect verticillium fungus in olive trees using aerial RGB imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles. The aim of our paper is to compare different architectures of the model and evaluate their performance on this task. The architectures are evaluated at two different input sizes each through the most widely used metrics for object detection and classification tasks (precision, recall, mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95). Our results show that the YOLOv5 algorithm is able to deliver good results in detecting olive trees and predicting their status, with the different architectures having different strengths and weaknesses.

AB To solve the difficulties in extracting general features of few-shot high-dimensional structural health monitoring data and making accurate repair decision, a civil aircraft structural repair decision method based on deep meta-learning (DML) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, multi-source structural health monitoring data such as component name, cumulative flight hours, inspection level and state parameters are collected as model input. In addition, the damage condition, repair level and repair definition are used as data labels. Secondly, DML model is used for few-shot learning of repair cases. Monitoring data and corresponding labels make up different target datasets, which can be used for training of base-learner and meta-learner. Thirdly, the historical cases in manual are used for in-sample prediction by meta-learning model, while the new cases are utilized for out-of-sample prediction by fine-tuning the initialized deep meta-learning model. Finally, the aircraft aluminum lap joint damage dataset is used for case study. The results show that the proposed deep meta-learning model can achieve higher accuracy when dealing with few-shot high-dimensional input. Compared with other models, the task oriented DML model has more strong generalization ability and higher classification accuracy in analyzing multi-task cases.

AB In this study, we investigate model structures for neural ODEs to improve the data efficiency in learning the dynamics of control systems. We introduce two model structures and compare them with a typical baseline structure. The first structure considers the relationship between the coordinates and velocities of the control system, while the second structure adds linearity with respect to the control term to the first structure. Both of these structures can be easily implemented without requiring additional computation. In numerical experiments, we evaluate these structure on simulated simple pendulum and CartPole systems and show that incorporating these characteristics into the model structure leads to accurate learning with a smaller amount of training data compared to the baseline structure.

AB This paper presents a method of pose estimation with camera localization based on a genetic algorithm to derive the joint angle using an inverse kinematics model. In recent years, some open-source libraries for human skeleton tracking that can be implemented on smartphones have been released. Such software can detect joint positions of a skeleton from a 2D camera image; however, the 3D posture cannot be obtained. We therefore propose a method to estimate joint an -gles by using skeleton data. In the proposed approach, we use a multi-island genetic algorithm to maintain the diversity of the population and design a multi-objective function to improve the robustness. More -over, structured learning based on topological map -ping is implemented in the proposed method to en-hance searching efficiency. In an experiment, the pro-posed method reduced the effect of outliers caused by misdetection. In addition, the structured learning was effective in decreasing the difference between skeleton data and the estimated poses.

AB Human parsing is one of the basic tasks in the field of computer vision. It aims at assigning pixel-level semantic labels to each human body part. Single human parsing requires further associating semantic parts with each instance. Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to distinguish the body parts with similar local features, this paper proposes a single human parsing method based on the visual attention mechanism. The proposed algorithm integrates advanced semantic features, global context information, and edge information to obtain accurate results of single human parsing resolution. The proposed algorithm is validated on standard look into part (LIP) dataset, and the results prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB The activation function introduces nonlinearity into convolutional neural network, which greatly promotes the development of computer vision tasks. This paper proposes elastic adaptively parametric compounded units to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks for image recognition. The activation function takes the structural advantages of two mainstream functions as the function's fundamental architecture. The SENet model is embedded in the proposed activation function to adaptively recalibrate the feature mapping weight in each channel, thereby enhancing the fitting capability of the activation function. In addition, the function has an elastic slope in the positive input region by simulating random noise to improve the generalization capability of neural networks. To prevent the generated noise from producing overly large variations during training, a special protection mechanism is adopted. In order to verify the effectiveness of the activation function, this paper uses CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image datasets to conduct comparative experiments of the activation function under the exact same model. Experimental results show that the proposed activation function showed superior performance beyond other functions.

AB The operating conditions influence the stability and consumption of a blast furnace. Recognizing these conditions makes changing the burden distribution parameters more efficient. The cooling stave temper-ature (CST) is a crucial state parameter that indicates the conditions of the process. Owing to the high data volume of the CST and the lack of methods for recog-nizing the stability of the slag crust, it is difficult for operators to recognize the conditions accurately ac-cording to the CST during the ironmaking process. Thus, in this study, a condition recognition method with information granulation for burden distribution in a blast furnace was presented. First, information granulation was employed to reduce the volume of the CST data and present it in a granular form. Then, considering the lack of a method for calculating the similarity of CST information granules, a novel fuzzy similarity calculation method was devised to calculate the membership grades of information granules be-longing to different standard granules. Finally, the conditions were recognized according to the member-ship values. Experimental results based on industrial data demonstrated that the proposed method can be used to recognizes the conditions in the blast furnace.

AB In this study, a drilling fluid prediction method based on an online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is proposed, which is prepared for water well drilling on the muddy clay formation of Tarim Basin, Qinghai Province. First, we investigated the mechanism linking mix ratio to fluid performance, al-lowing us to employ an OS-ELM algorithm derived from the extreme learning machine. Particularly, the proposed prediction method is bidirectional to identify an appropriate slurry formulation. The forward pre-diction model is established to predict the fluid per-formance, where the mud additive contents are in-puts, and the drilling fluid properties parameters are outputs. Correspondingly, the backward prediction model is established to modify the slurry formula, where differences in the drilling fluid properties are inputs and percentages of slurry additives amount are output. The simulation results show that the two -direction OS-ELM prediction model can better pre-dict the drilling fluid properties in water well drilling.

AB In this study, we introduce a system called Matrix Researcher2vec (MResearcher2vec) which generates researcher embedding vectors from their papers and research projects in researchmap and KAKENHI databases. The system includes data on 276,841 re-searchers, 6,161,592 papers, and research projects. Utilizing natural language processing techniques, the MResearcher2vec model extracts researcher vectors from the papers and research project summaries of KAKENHI grant recipients. The similarity be-tween reseachers is then computed to visualize inter -researcher relationships. The machine learning results have been integrated into a web service, providing a novel approach for academic relationship mining. It can be applied in the matching of research contents and researchers in evaluation of industry-government -academia collaboration and joint research. It con-tributes in four aspects: (1) exchanges between re-searchers, (2) creation of opportunities for researchers and companies to connect, (3) further promotion of in-terdisciplinary research, and (4) reduction of lost op-portunities for research institutions to acquire talents.

AB In the future, considering the expansion of the autonomous driving society, autonomous driving systems that can drive safely and quickly will be required for the purpose of saving lives and transporting goods even on rough road such as snowy, icy, and unpaved roads. In such unknown environments, technologies that combine model-based control and artificial intelligence (AI) are attracting attention for the purpose of ensuring operational stability and reliability. The second author has proposed a vehicle driving model that is robust to road geometry and ever-changing environmental disturbances. This model is based on a twowheel model, and expresses the error in the position of the center of gravity of the vehicle by the front wheel steering angle deviation, and adaptively estimates this deviation. However, this model has large modeling errors when driving at high velocity on slippery roads. In this study, we extend this model proposed in previous study, and propose a new vehicle driving model usefulness of the proposed method in a simulation using vehicle motion analysis software.

DE averaging inverse characteristics method; characteristic speed;

AB Numerical calculations are used in various situations. However, to achieve accurate numerical calculations, accuracy in the calculation method and initial values with high spatial resolution are necessary. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating spatial values that considers characteristic theory but does not use interpolation. We consider the treatment of the curved characteristic line, which implies that the characteris-tic speed is altered locally. In the new method named averaging inverse characteristics method (AICM), the locally changing characteristic speed is averaged with the characteristic speed of the previous steps. We cal-culated the spatial values of the shock tube problem, described by the Euler equation, and examined the ac-curacy of the AICM by comparing the results of the inverse characteristics method (ICM) proposed in the previous study and the traditional interpolating meth-ods. Compared to other methods, AICM reduced the error to less than 1/10 for all parameters. We deter-mined from these results that the AICM accurately estimates the spatial distribution of problems where characteristic speed has significantly changed.

AB The illegal dumping of aluminum and plastic into cities and marine areas leads to negative impacts on the ecosystem and contributes to increased environ-mental pollution. Although volunteer trash pickup ac-tivities have increased in recent years, they require sig-nificant effort, time, and money. Therefore, we pro -pose automated trash pickup robot, which incorpo-rates autonomous movement and trash pickup arms. Although these functions have been actively devel-oped, relatively little research has focused on trash detection. As such, we have developed a trash detec-tion function by using deep learning models to im-prove the accuracy. First, we created a new trash dataset that classifies four types of trash with high ille-gal dumping volumes (cans, plastic bottles, cardboard, and cigarette butts). Next, we developed a new you only look once (YOLO)-based model with low parame-ters and computations. We trained the model on a cre-ated dataset and a dataset consisting of marine trash created during previous research. In consequence, the proposed models achieve the same detection accuracy as the existing models on both datasets, with fewer pa-rameters and computations. Furthermore, the pro -posed models accelerate the edge device's frame rate.

AB Experimental education imparted at universities is essential for students to confirm their theoretical knowledge. Experiments, in general, can deal with realworld data that theory or simulation cannot handle. However, there are experimental subjects where it is difficult to obtain results according to the theory. Among them, heat conduction is a subject wherein it is difficult to obtain theoretical results because it is difficult to establish an experimental environment. Therefore, it is highly important to design experimental content using students' perspectives, such as theory and gates the impact of education on the design and application of experimental apparatus for a heat-transfer experiment, which is a part of an experiment conducted by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tokyo University of Technology. Furthermore, we discuss the effectiveness of the proposed experimental system based on students' behavior, comprehension, satisfaction, and subsequent results.

AB Gripping comfort evaluation was crucial for designing a product with good gripping comfort. In this study, a novel evaluation method using gripping posture im-age was constructed based on convolutional neural network (CNN). Human subject experiment was con-ducted to acquire gripping comfort scores and grip-ping posture images while gripping seven objects with simple shape and eleven manufactured products. The scores and the images were used as training set and validation set for CNN. Classification problem was employed to classify gripping posture images as com-fort or discomfort. As a result, accuracies were 91.4% for simple shape objects and 76.2% for manufactured products. Regression problem was utilized to predict gripping comfort scores from gripping posture images while gripping cylindrical object. Gripping posture images of radial and dorsal sides in direction of hand were used to investigate effect of direction of hand on prediction accuracy. Consequently, mean absolute er-rors (MAE) of gripping comfort scores were 0.132 for radial side and 0.157 for dorsal side in direction of hand. In both problems, the results indicated that these evaluation methods were useful to evaluate grip-ping comfort. The evaluation methods help designers to evaluate products and enhance gripping comfort.

AB In the communication-constrained operating environment, a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) needs to plan a feasible path from the starting point to the endpoint while planning the node deployment location for multi-hop communication to establish an information pathway. In this study, a new algorithm was designed for joint path and multi-hop communication node location planning in cluttered environments based on rapidly-exploring random trees star (RRT*) algorithm. The maximum communication distance constraint between nodes was obtained based on the signal-free propagation model, whereas the communication node loss and path loss were established as joint optimization objectives. In bidirectional random tree growth, the structure of the trees was optimized according to the value of the loss function, and optimal path and node location planning were finally achieved through continuous growth and iteration. When tested in different complexity-barrier environments and compared to RRT*, Informed-RRT*, sults of the new algorithm are close to those of the comparison algorithms; however, the number of nodes decreases significantly, which proves the effectiveness of the newly proposed algorithm.

DE real-time semantic segmentation; depth sep-arable convolution; attention
   mechanism
AB Herein, a dual-branch semantic segmentation model based on depth-separable convolution and attention mechanism is proposed for the real-time and accuracy requirement of semantic segmentation. The proposed approach overcomes the problems of poor segmentation effect and over-simplification of feature fusion arising from the constant downsample operations in semantic segmentation. The network is divided into spatial detail and semantic information paths. The spatial detail path utilizes a smaller downsample multiplier to maintain resolution and efficiently extract spatial information. The semantic information path is constructed by a non-bottleneck residual unit with dilated convolution; it extracts semantic features. For the feature aggregation problem, the feature-guided fusion module is designed to assign different weights to the parts of the two paths and fuse them to obtain the final output. The proposed algorithm achieves a segmentation accuracy of 69.6% and speed of 70 fps on the Cityscapes dataset, with a model parameter count of only 0.76 M, thus indicating some advantages over recent real-time semantic segmentation algorithms. The proposed method with depth separable convolution and attention mechanism can effectively extract features and compensate for the loss of accuracy caused by downsampling. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed fusion module outperforms other methods in fusing different features.

AB This article examines the stability problem of systems with interval time-varying delays. In the derivation of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), non-convex higher-degree polynomials may arise with respect to interval time-varying delays, making it difficult to de-termine the negative definiteness of LKF's derivative. This study was conducted to obtain stability condi-tions that can be described as linear matrix inequal-ities (LMIs). By considering the idea of matrix transi-tion and introducing the delay-dependent augmented vector, a novel higher-degree polynomial inequality is proposed under the condition that the lower bound of the polynomial function variable is non-zero, which encompasses the existing lemmas as its special cases. Then, benefiting from this inequality, a stability crite-rion is derived in terms of LMIs. Finally, several typ-ical examples are presented to verify the availability and strength of the stability condition.

AB Rehabilitation evaluation is an important part of re-habilitation training. It is closely related to the robot-assisted training effect. Different rehabilitation robots need different methods to evaluate patients. Rehabilitation training is a long process, and the patient's performance scores will continue to change. A lower-limb rehabilitation robot needs a dynamic performance score to evaluate rehabilitation's effects. This study used an analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation methods to establish a rehabilitation evaluation system for lower-limb rehabilitation robots. A multi-scale personalized rehabilitation plan is conceived, based on the evaluation system and the combination of objective factors. This method dynamically adjusts the plan according to the rehabilitation situation of patients, which is beneficial to the improvement of the efficiency and initiative of training.

AB To overcome the previous challenges and to mitigate the retransmission and acknowledgment of LoRa for electric shelf labels, the data parallelism model is used for transmitting the concurrent data from the network server to end devices (EDs) through gateways (GWs). The EDs are designated around the GWs based on machine clustering to minimize data congestion, collision, and overlapping during signal reception. Deployment and redeployment of EDs in the defined clusters depend on arithmetic distribution to reduce the nearfar effect and the overall saturation in the network. To further improve the performance and analyze the behavior of the network, constant uplink power for signal-to-noise (SNR) while dynamic for received signal strength (RSS) has been proposed. In contrast to SNR, the RSS indicator estimates the actual position of the ED to prevent the capture effect. In the experimental implementation, downlink power at the connected defined threshold.

AB In the quest for human-robot interaction (HRI), lead-ing to the development of emotion recognition, learn-ing, and analysis capabilities, robotics plays a signif-icant role in human perception, attention, decision -making, and social communication. However, the accurate recognition of emotions in HRI remains a challenge. This is due to the coexistence of multiple sources of information in utilizing multimodal facial expressions and head poses as multiple convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning are com-bined. This research analyzes and improves the ro-bustness of emotion recognition, and proposes a novel approach that optimizes traditional deep neural net-works that fall into poor local optima when optimiz-ing the weightings of the deep neural network using standard methods. The proposed approach adaptively finds the better weightings of the network, resulting in a hybrid genetic algorithm with stochastic gradient de-scent (HGASGD). This hybrid algorithm combines the inherent, implicit parallelism of the genetic algorithm with the better global optimization of stochastic gradi-ent descent (SGD). An experiment shows the effective-ness of our proposed approach in providing complete emotion recognition through a combination of multi -modal data, CNNs, and HGASGD, indicating that it represents a powerful tool in achieving interactions be-tween humans and robotics. To validate and test the effectiveness of our proposed approach through ex-periments, the performance and reliability of our ap-proach and two variants of HGASGD FER are com-pared using a large dataset of facial images. Our ap-proach integrates multimodal information from facial expressions and head poses, enabling the system to recognize emotions better. The results show that CNN-HGASGD outperforms CNNs-SGD and other existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of FER.

First, the influence of exogenous disturbances on the system is estimated based on the IEID method. The estimate is added to the control input channel to offset this influence. A necessary and sufficient condition is obtained to ensure that the singular system is admissible and satisfies dissipativity performance level. Subsequently, a state-feedback controller is designed based on the admissibility condition. Finally, a numerical example is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.

AB A novel method for predicting the thicknesses of plastics based on continuous-wave terahertz (THz) sented in this study. Initially, the target material's THz refractive index is determined from the phase information provided by the coherent nature of THz-FDS. For thickness prediction, the optimal frequency band with a high signal-to-noise ratio and minor water vapor absorption is chosen first. The optical path along which the THz wave passes through a sample with unknown thickness is extracted from the phase delay information. The physical thickness of the sample is then determined using the calibrated refractive index obtained in the first step. Teflon, a classical plastic material, is utilized to illustrate the proposed process. A remarkable consistency with an overall relative differpredicted and caliper measured thicknesses. The procapabilities of THz spectroscopy.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM
AB In this paper we exploit concepts from Information Theory to improve the classical Chvatal greedy algorithm for the set covering problem. In particular, we develop a new greedy procedure, called Surprisal-Based Greedy Heuristic (SBH), incorporating the computation of a "surprisal" measure when selecting the solution columns. Computational experiments, performed on instances from the OR-Library, showed that SBH yields a 2.5% improvement in terms of the objective function value over the Chvatal's algorithm while retaining similar execution times, making it suitable for real-time applications. The new heuristic was also compared with Kordalewski's greedy algorithm, obtaining similar solutions in much shorter times on large instances, and Grossmann and Wool's algorithm for unicost instances, where SBH obtained better solutions.

AB Digital assistants-such as chatbots-facilitate the interaction between persons and machines and are increasingly used in web pages of enterprises and organizations. This paper presents a methodology for the creation of chatbots that offer access to museum information. The paper introduces an information model that is offered through the chatbot, which subsequently maps the museum's modeled information to structures of DialogFlow, Google's chatbot engine. Means for automating the chatbot generation process are also presented. The evaluation of the methodology is illustrated through the application of a real case, wherein we developed a chatbot for the Archaeological Museum of Tripolis, Greece.
