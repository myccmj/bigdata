AB This paper presents a new Edge-AI algorithm for real-time and multi-feature (social distancing, mask detection, and facial temperature) measurement to minimize the spread of COVID-19 among individuals. COVID-19 has extenuated the need for an intelligent surveillance video system that can monitor the status of social distancing, mask detection, and measure the temperature of faces simultaneously using deep learning (DL) models. In this research, we utilized the fusion of three different YOLOv4-tiny object detectors for each task of the integrated system. This DL model is used for object detection and targeted for real-time applications. The proposed models have been trained for different data sets, which include people detection, mask detection, and facial detection for measuring the temperature, and evaluated on these existing data sets. Thermal and visible cameras have been used for the proposed approach. The thermal camera is used for social distancing and facial temperature measurement, while a visible camera is used for mask detection. The proposed method has been executed on NVIDIA platforms to assess algorithmic performance. For evaluation of the trained models, accuracy, recall, and precision have been measured. We obtained promising results for real-time detection for human recognition. Different couples of thermal and visible cameras and different NVIDIA edge platforms have been adopted to explore solutions with different trade-offs between cost and performance. The multi-feature algorithm is designed to monitor the individuals continuously in the targeted environments, thus reducing the impact of COVID-19 spread.

AB AI algorithms such as CNNs devices have necessitated the design of lightweight, low-power, and fast hardware in edge processors. In this paper, a floating-point convolution core is proposed for edge processors to implement CNN. At first, the conventional CNN networks were analyzed in terms of the abundance of filter size. Considering the performance and execution time, the focus of the research is on size of 3 x 3. Next, using the proposed 10-input adder instead of nine 2-input adders and modifying the multipliers, an optimum 32-bit 3 x 3 convolution core has been designed. After studying different bit widths in mantissa and the exponent of floating-point numbers in CNNs, 13-bit is considered as the minimum bit width without accuracy losing. The 3 x 3 core with the new bit width is implemented. Since filter sizes 1 x 1 and 5 x 5 are also available in conventional networks, the new scalable architecture is designed to support all three sizes. Finally, the YOLOv4-tiny object detection and GoogLeNet are used as two benchmarks to evaluate the final 3 x 3 scalable core. The results have shown that despite using floating-point calculations, the FPS is equal to 45.9, which is equal to the previous works that were done in fixed-point, while the accuracy of the proposed work is 84% which is similar to the 32-bit floating point.

TI Ontology alignment with semantic and structural embeddings
SO JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS

DE Ontology alignment; Semantic embedding; Structural embedding;
   Representation learning
AB Ontology alignment is essential for data integration and interoperability across multiple applications across diverse disciplines. In recent decades, significant advancements have been made in the development of advanced methods and systems for ontology alignment. Empirical results have suggested that ontological semantics can be effectively employed to enhance the alignment process. Besides, structural information is crucial for ontology alignment as it reflects the relations among adjacent concepts in the ontology. Previous works are mainly based on external lexicon and predefined rules based on ontological structure. Recently, deep learning has imposed positive impacts on ontology alignment and obtained substantial improvement. This paper proposes a new method based on ontology embedding incorporating the semantic and structural features. It utilizes the distance between the embedding of two ontological concepts to be aligned as the criterion for alignment.The proposed method is used to align two widely used food ontologies and three Chinese food classification ontologies. The experimental results show that our method enhances the performance compared to several state-of-the-art alignment systems, demonstrating the importance of learning semantic representation and structural representation. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated on several different tracks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), and experimental results show that our method outperforms other baselines in effectiveness.

   analysis
ID NETWORK
AB Motor dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients is typically assessed by clinicians employing the Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Such comprehensive clinical assessments are time-consuming, expensive, semi-subjective, and may potentially result in conflicting labels across different raters. To address this problem, we propose an automatic, objective, and weakly supervised method for labeling PD patients' gait videos. The proposed method accepts videos of patients and classifies their gait scores as normal (Gait score in MDS-UPDRS = 0) or PD (MDS-UPDRS & GE; 1). Unlike previous work, the proposed method does not require a priori MDS-UPDRS ratings for training, utilizing only domain specific knowledge obtained from neurologists. We propose several labeling functions that classify patients' gait and use a generative model to learn the accuracy of each labeling function in a self-supervised manner. Since results depended upon the estimated values of the patients' 3D poses, and existing pre-trained 3D pose estimators did not yield accurate results, we propose a weakly-supervised 3D human pose estimation method for fine-tuning pre-trained models in a clinical setting. Using leave-one-out evaluations, the proposed method obtains an accuracy of 89% on a dataset of 29 PD subjects - a significant improvement compared to previous work by 7%-10% depending upon the dataset. The method obtained state-of-the-art results on the Human3.6M dataset. Our results suggest that the use of labeling functions may provide a robust means to interpret and classify patient-oriented videos involving motor tasks.

TI CDDSA: Contrastive domain disentanglement and style augmentation for

SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS

DT Article
DE Disentanglement; Domain generalization; Contrastive learning; Medical
   image segmentation
AB Generalization to previously unseen images with potential domain shifts is essential for clinically applicable medical image segmentation. Disentangling domain-specific and domain-invariant features is key for Domain Generalization (DG). However, existing DG methods struggle to achieve effective disentanglement. To address this problem, we propose an efficient framework called Contrastive Domain Disentanglement and Style Augmentation (CDDSA) for generalizable medical image segmentation. First, a disentangle network decomposes the image into domain-invariant anatomical representation and domain-specific style code, where the former is sent for further segmentation that is not affected by domain shift, and the disentanglement is regularized by a decoder that combines the anatomical representation and style code to reconstruct the original image. Second, to achieve better disentanglement, a contrastive loss is proposed to encourage the style codes from the same domain and different domains to be compact and divergent, respectively. Finally, to further improve generalizability, we propose a style augmentation strategy to synthesize images with various unseen styles in real time while maintaining anatomical information. Comprehensive experiments on a public multi-site fundus image dataset and an in-house multi-site Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Magnetic Resonance Image (NPC-MRI) dataset show that the proposed CDDSA achieved remarkable generalizability across different domains, and it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in generalizable segmentation.

AB Microsatellite instability (MSI) refers to alterations in the length of simple repetitive genomic sequences. MSI status serves as a prognostic and predictive factor in colorectal cancer. The MSI-high status is a good prognostic factor in stage II/III cancer, and predicts a lack of benefit to adjuvant fluorouracil chemotherapy in stage II cancer but a good response to immunotherapy in stage IV cancer. Therefore, determining MSI status in patients with colorectal cancer is important for identifying the appropriate treatment protocol. In the Pathology Artificial Intelligence Platform (PAIP) 2020 challenge, artificial intelligence researchers were invited to predict MSI status based on colorectal cancer slide images. Participants were required to perform two tasks. The primary task was to classify a given slide image as belonging to either the MSI-high or the microsatellite-stable group. The second task was tumor area segmentation to avoid ties with the main task. A total of 210 of the 495 participants enrolled in the challenge downloaded the images, and 23 teams submitted their final results. Seven teams from the top 10 participants agreed to disclose their algorithms, most of which were convolutional neural network-based deep learning models, such as EfficientNet and UNet. The top-ranked system achieved the highest F1 score (0.9231). This paper summarizes the various methods used in the PAIP 2020 challenge. This paper supports the effectiveness of digital pathology for identifying the relationship between colorectal cancer and the MSI characteristics.

AB Malware is a significant threat to the security of computer systems and networks worldwide, and its sophistication and diversity continue to increase over time. One of the key challenges in malware detec-tion and classification is the high variability and similarity of the malicious code. This paper proposes a novel method for malware classification with disentangled representation from an evolutionary triplet network. We aim to learn a representation of malware samples that captures the underlying factors of variation, making it easier to distinguish between different malware types. The genetic algorithm-based optimization enables us to find the optimal distance representation of malware, which helps to minimize the intra-class distance and maximize the inter-class distance in the disentangled space. By evolutionary optimization of the triplet network, our model is able to better capture the subtle differ-ences in the structural characteristics of malware, which led to significant improvements of classification accuracy and recall in three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, this method demonstrates significant improvement on t-SNE visualization, indicating that the learned features are more discriminative and better capture the underlying structure of the malware.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI AOG-LSTM: An adaptive attention neural network for visual storytelling

DE Text generation; Visual storytelling; Neural network; Image

AB Visual storytelling is the task of generating a related story fora given image sequence, which has received significant attention. However, using general RNNs (such as LSTM and GRU) as the decoder limit the per-formance of the models in this task. This is because they can not differentiate different types of informa-tion representations. In addition, optimizing the probabilities of subsequent words conditioned on the previous ground-truth sequences can cause error accumulation during inference. Moreover, the existing method of alleviating error accumulation based on replacing reference words does not take into account the different effects of each word. To address the above problems, we propose a modified neural network named AOG-LSTM and a modified training strategy named ARS, respectively. AOG-LSTM can adaptatively pay appropriate attention to different information representations within it when predicting different words. During training, ARS replaces some words in the reference sentences with model predictions similar to the existing method. However, we utilize the selection network and selection strategy to select more appropriate words for the replacement to better improve the model. Experiments on the VIST Dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms several strong baselines on the most commonly used metrics.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Recommender systems suggest items that are likely to be preferred by a particular user based on historical behavior, actions, and feedback. In real-world applications, data on users and items are continuously generated at a fast pace, such as in e-commerce, social media, digital marketing, and content consumption applications. Since interactions occur over time, these scenarios can be formulated as a data stream where users' interests are potentially dynamic, i.e., they change over time. Given that changes are expected to occur, one of the current research challenges in streaming recommender systems is that models must adapt their parameters when changes occur to maintain performance. As such changes do not occur for all users and items in the stream at the same time, we consider adapting learning schemes to account for user or item identifiers and model individual parameters. Therefore, we used specialized parameters to adjust the step size for each dataset user or item. More specifically, this study proposes four specialized and specialized-generalized variants of four well-known adaptive learning rate optimizers and shows how they are combined with incremental matrix factorization methods. We tested our proposed optimization strategies on different datasets and showed that one of the proposed specialized variants, that is, InAMSGradUser, improves the RECALL and NDCG rates by up to 11.1 and 7.5 percentage points, respectively, compared to the traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Positive unlabeled learning is a binary classification problem with positive and unlabeled data. It is com-mon in domains where negative labels are costly or impossible to obtain, e.g., medicine and personalized advertising. Most approaches to positive unlabeled learning apply to specific data types (e.g., images, cat-egorical data) and can not generate new positive and negative samples. This work introduces a feature-space distance-based tensor network approach to the positive unlabeled learning problem. The presented method is not domain specific and significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on the MNIST image and 15 categorical/mixed datasets. The trained tensor network model is also a generative model and enables the generation of new positive and negative instances.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID BIOLOGICAL VARIATION; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; CHECKLIST; SAMPLES
AB Instantial variation (IV) refers to variation that is due not to population differences or errors, but rather to within-subject variation, that is the intrinsic and characteristic patterns of variation pertaining to a given instance or the measurement process. Although taking into account IV is critical for the proper analysis of the results, this source of uncertainty and its impact on robustness have so far been neglected in Machine Learning (ML). To fill this gap, we look at how IV affects ML performance and generalization, and how its impact can be mitigated. Specifically, we provide a methodological contribution to formalize the problem of IV in the statistical learning framework. To prove the relevance of our contribution, we focus on one of the most critical domains, healthcare, and take individual (analytical and biological) variation as a specific kind of IV; in this domain, we use one of the largest real-world laboratory medicine datasets for the task of COVID-19 detection, to show that: (1) common state-of-the-art ML models are severely impacted by the presence of IV in data; and (2) advanced learning strategies, based on data augmentation and soft computing methods (data imprecisiation), and proper study designs can be effective at improving robustness to IV. Our findings demonstrate the critical relevance of correctly accounting for IV to enable safe deployment of ML in real-world settings. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a prevalent learning paradigm for solving stochastic games. In most MARL studies, agents in a game are defined as teammates or enemies beforehand, and the relationships among the agents (i.e., their identities) remain fixed throughout the game. However, in real-world problems, the agent relationships are commonly unknown in advance or dynamically changing. Many multi-party interactions start off by asking: who is on my team? This question arises whether it is the first day at the stock exchange or the kindergarten. Therefore, training policies for such situations in the face of imperfect information and ambiguous identities is an important problem that needs to be addressed. In this work, we develop a novel identity detection reinforcement learning (IDRL) framework that allows an agent to dynamically infer the identities of nearby agents and select an appropriate policy to accomplish the task. In the IDRL framework, a relation network is constructed to deduce the identities of other agents by observing the behaviors of the agents. A danger network is optimized to estimate the risk of false-positive identifications. Beyond that, we propose an intrinsic reward that balances the need to maximize external rewards and accurate identification. After identifying the cooperation-competition pattern among the agents, IDRL applies one of the off-the-shelf MARL methods to learn the policy. To evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on Red-10 card shedding game, and the results show that IDRL achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art MARL methods. Impressively, the relation network has the par performance to identify the identities of agents with top human players; the danger network reasonably avoids the risk of imperfect identification. The code to reproduce all the reported results is available online at https://github.com/MR-BENjie/IDRL.

ID VOICE CONVERSION; RECOGNITION
AB Communication becomes effectual while the verbal communication signal reaches the destination with profound characteristics. An application based on human voice attracts the researcher's attention. It leads the researcher to proceed towards the speech conversion for low voice humans having murmured voices as their attitude. The researchers introduced a technique for improving the body-conducted unvoiced speech for silent speech communication using Taylor-Boltzmann machine-trained optimized Deep Neural Network (DNN). The projected model includes two main stages: the training stage as well as recognition stage. In the training stage, the following functionalities are undergone: (i) pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction, and (iii) deep learning-based speech enhancement. Initially, the collected input Non-Audible Murmur (NAM) speech signal is subjected to the pre-processing stage, wherein the improved wiener filtering is employed for suppressing the noise in the input signal. From the pre-processed speech signal, the most relevant characteristics such as "spectral skewness, spectral chroma, spectral centroid and improved Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)" are extracted, and they are fused together. Then, using these fused features, the Taylor series with optimized DNN and Boltzmann Machine (Taylor-DNN-BM) model is trained. The final enhanced speech is acquired from the Taylor-optimized DNN-BM. The recognition phase encapsulates the feature extraction and deep learning-based speech enhancement stage. The input speech data enters into the feature extrac-tion phase, wherein the characteristics such as "spectral skewness, spectral chroma, spectral centroid and improved (MFCC)" are retrieved. After that, these features are fused and fed as input to the Taylor-optimized DNN-BM model. From Taylor-optimized DNN-BM, the enhanced speech signal is acquired. In DNN, the weight function is fine-tuned using the newly projected Self Improved Flower Pollination Algorithm (SI-FPA) algorithm. This SI-FPA model is the conceptual improvement of the Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA). Finally, the projected model is compared with the existing models to validate its efficiency in terms of speech enhancement.

AB Salient object detection plays an important role in many downstream tasks. However, complex real-world scenes with varying scales and numbers of salient objects still pose a challenge. In this paper, we directly address the problem of detecting multiple salient objects across complex scenes. We propose a network architecture incorporating non-local feature information in both the spatial and channel spaces, capturing the long-range dependencies between separate objects. Traditional bottom-up and non-local features are combined with edge features within a feature fusion gate that progressively refines the salient object prediction in the decoder. We show that our approach accurately locates multiple salient regions even in complex scenarios. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach to the multiple salient objects problem, we curate a new dataset containing only multiple salient objects. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method presents stateof-the-art results on five widely used datasets without any pre-processing and post-processing. We obtain a further performance improvement against competing techniques on our multi-objects dataset. The dataset and source code are available at: https://github.com/EricDengbowen/DSLRDNet.

AB It is necessary to analyze the whole-body kinematics (including joint locations and joint angles) to assess risks of fatal and musculoskeletal injuries in occupational tasks. Human pose estimation has gotten more attention in recent years as a method to minimize the errors in determining joint locations. However, the joint angles are not often estimated, nor is the quality of joint angle estimation assessed. In this paper, we presented an end-to -end approach on direct joint angle estimation from multi-view images. Our method leveraged the volumetric pose representation and mapped the rotation representation to a continuous space where each rotation was uniquely represented. We also presented a new kinematic dataset in the domain of residential roofing with a data processing pipeline to generate necessary annotations for the supervised training procedure on direct joint angle estimation. We achieved a mean angle error of 7.19 degrees on the new Roofing dataset and 8.41 degrees on the Human3.6M dataset, paving the way for employment of on-site kinematic analysis using multi-view images.

DE Neural painting; Generative models; Interactive generation
AB In the last few years, Neural Painting (NP) techniques became capable of producing extremely realistic artworks. This paper advances the state of the art in this emerging research domain by proposing the first approach for Interactive NP. Considering a setting where a user looks at a scene and tries to reproduce it on a painting, our objective is to develop a computational framework to assist the user's creativity by suggesting the next strokes to paint, that can be possibly used to complete the artwork. To accomplish such a task, we propose I-Paint, a novel method based on a conditional transformer Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture with a two-stage decoder. To evaluate the proposed approach and stimulate research in this area, we also introduce two novel datasets. Our experiments show that our approach provides good stroke suggestions and compares favorably to the state of the art.

ID JOINT IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB Cross-domain fashion retrieval is a feasible method for finding the required clothing among a large number of products. Computer vision-based retrieval algorithms have been developed by many researchers. However, the precise retrieval process still faces challenges such as corrupted query images, ambiguous patterns, and an array of attributes. In this work, a novel attention-guided cascaded network has been proposed for efficient cloth retrieval by overcoming the aforementioned challenges. Initially, the input images are pre-processed with Wavelet integrated Retinex algorithm (WRA) to enhance the query cloth image without diminishing the important information. The attention-guided cascaded network is designed with global feature descriptor (GFD) and local feature descriptor (LFD) modules for extracting the domain-enriched features. These two modules are integrated with an attention block to reduce complexity and improve performance using selected features. In the LFD module, the Clothing Parsing Encoder-Decoder network (CPED-Net) is used to separate the bottom and top regions and sends them into the respective network for fine-grained feature analysis. Finally, global and local features from the modules are combined in similarity analysis for cloth retrieval. The proposed model achieves an overall accuracy of 98.54% based on the fashion retrieval benchmarks dataset. From the experimental results, the proposed model is superior to the state-of-the-art models.

DT Article
DE Social relation recognition; Scene understanding; Group interaction;
   Image classification
AB Modern societies are composed of complex structures that emerge from the relationships between individuals, and the comprehension of these arrangements has the potential to become a powerful tool for intelligent systems. Current image-based social relation recognition methods isolate specific information from the input to capture essential aspects defining these relationships. However, this is an inaccurate approach since the interaction between all these parts form an intricate structure, which is as valuable as the data each piece carries individually. Consequently, capturing this implicit social structure is essential to achieve the high-level reasoning required to identify relationships adequately. In this work, we propose a novel approach to interpret relationships based on three distinct scopes considering individual, relative, and general information. Additionally, it also takes into account prior knowledge and data dependencies between all these different social perspectives. The Social Knowledge Graph (SKG) is proposed based on these concepts, producing a representation capable of replicating the original social structure. This unique representation is exploited with the Social Graph Network (SGN) by employing specific feature aggregation strategies according to the information embedded into the graph. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated in well-known benchmarks for social relation recognition, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Finally, a deep analysis of the methodology and its main concepts is conducted, delivering results that support our interpretation of social relationships.

   MANAGEMENT
AB Melanoma, despite its relatively low incidence compared to other types of skin cancer, accounts for a significant proportion of skin cancer-related deaths. Early detection of melanoma is crucial for improving patient survival rates. Deep learning algorithms, which heavily rely on data, are widely used in melanoma detection. However, the performance of these algorithms is greatly influenced by the distribution of the dataset, particularly class imbalance. In this manuscript, the authors present a novel method based on the Kemeny-Young rule for optimal rank aggregation to address the class imbalance problem in melanoma detection. The proposed approach aims to reduce class bias and enhance overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, a cost-sensitive learning approach is introduced to improve the classifier's ability to handle class imbalance effectively. This novel cost-sensitive learning method utilizes Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution Optimization to determine optimal weights for each class. Our approach differs from traditional methods that assign weights based on predefined criteria. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on the highly imbalanced ISIC 2020 dataset, which is widely used in melanoma detection research. The Kemeny-Young rule-based majority voting achieves an overall error rate of 2.44%, while the cost-sensitive learning based on the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution approach achieves an even lower error rate of 1.99%. Moreover, the proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 87.93% and a specificity of 98.19%. These experimental results demonstrate the competitiveness and effectiveness of the proposed methods in addressing the challenges posed by class imbalance and improving the accuracy of melanoma detection. By effectively mitigating class imbalance, these methods improve the accuracy and reliability of melanoma detection, thus offering valuable insights for developing advanced computer-aided diagnosis systems in dermatology. The relevant codes for our proposed approach are publicly available at: https://github.com/ctrl-gaurav/Handling-Imbalanced-Class-in-Melanoma.

ID BAYESIAN NETWORK; BUILDING SYSTEMS; STRATEGY; MODEL; IMPLEMENTATION
AB Fault diagnosis is crucial for energy conversation in building energy systems. There are three different types of fault diagnosis methods: residual-, knowledge-, and data-driven. Each of them has its unique advantages and drawbacks. This study proposes a hybrid Bayesian network (HBN) to merge these methods to make their advantages complementary. The symptom layer of the HBN includes three different types of nodes: residual nodes composed of the feature residuals from the residual-driven part, knowledge nodes composed of the knowledge from the knowledge-driven part, and data nodes composed of the feature measurements from the data-driven part. Based on such fusion mechanisms, residual, knowledge, and data are merged into a single framework, and play roles in a parallel way, meaning that it can tolerate missing any kind of part in the fault diagnosis process. The proposed method can be easily customized by users, and, to a certain extent, overcomes the weaknesses of the individual methods when used separately, thus achieving outstanding field application performance. Meanwhile, a generic framework to develop the residual-knowledge-data jointly driven method is given. Applied to two experimental chillers and compared with existing frequently-used methods, the proposed method is proven to have better overall and individual performance.

AB We present a novel computer algorithm to automatically detect and segment pulmonary embolisms (PEs) on computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA). This algorithm is based on deep learning but does not require manual outlines of the PE regions. Given a CTPA scan, both intra-and extra-pulmonary arteries were firstly segmented. The arteries were then partitioned into several parts based on size (radius). Adaptive thresholding and constrained morphological operations were used to identify suspicious PE regions within each part. The confidence of a suspicious region to be PE was scored based on its contrast in the arteries. This approach was applied to the publicly available RSNA Pulmonary Embolism CT Dataset (RSNA-PE) to identify three-dimensional (3-D) PE negative and positive image patches, which were used to train a 3-D Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2-Unet) to automatically segment PE. The feasibility of this computer algorithm was validated on an independent test set consisting of 91 CTPA scans acquired from a different medical institute, where the PE regions were manually located and outlined by a thoracic radiologist (>18 years' experience). An R2-Unet model was also trained and validated on the manual outlines using a 5-fold cross-validation method. The CNN model trained on the high-confident PE regions showed a Dice coefficient of 0.676 & PLUSMN;0.168 and a false positive rate of 1.86 per CT scan, while the CNN model trained on the manual outlines demonstrated a Dice coefficient of 0.647 & PLUSMN;0.192 and a false positive rate of 4.20 per CT scan. The former model performed significantly better than the latter model (p<0.01). The promising performance of the developed PE detection and segmentation algorithm suggests the feasibility of training a deep learning network without dedicating significant efforts to manual annotations of the PE regions on CTPA scans.

TI Multi-target landmark detection with incomplete images via reinforcement

ID WHOLE HEART SEGMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; MODELS
AB Medical images are generally acquired with limited field-of-view (FOV), which could lead to incomplete regions of interest (ROI), and thus impose a great challenge on medical image analysis. This is particularly evident for the learning-based multi-target landmark detection, where algorithms could be misleading to learn primarily the variation of background due to the varying FOV, failing the detection of targets. Based on learning a navigation policy, instead of predicting targets directly, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have the potential to tackle this challenge in an efficient manner. Inspired by this, in this work we propose a multi -agent RL framework for simultaneous multi-target landmark detection. This framework is aimed to learn from incomplete or (and) complete images to form an implicit knowledge of global structure, which is consolidated during the training stage for the detection of targets from either complete or incomplete test images. To further explicitly exploit the global structural information from incomplete images, we propose to embed a shape model into the RL process. With this prior knowledge, the proposed RL model can not only localize dozens of targets simultaneously, but also work effectively and robustly in the presence of incomplete images. We validated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method on various multi-target detection tasks with incomplete images from practical clinics, using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cardiac MRI and head CT datasets. Results showed that our method could predict whole set of landmarks with incomplete training images up to 80% missing proportion (average distance error 2.29 cm on body DXA), and could detect unseen landmarks in regions with missing image information outside FOV of target images (average distance error 6.84 mm on 3D half-head CT). Our code will be released via https://zmiclab.github.io/projects.html.

ID NETWORK
AB In real life, people often go together in groups, which extends to an important but less researched task of computer vision: group re-identification. Differing from the related task of person re-identification, group reidentification involves unique challenges: self-occlusion, layout changes, membership changes, and the lack of labeled data. To solve these problems, we propose a patch-based camera-aware person-to-group unsupervised learning network. For the problem of high labeling costs, we train an unsupervised feature extraction network to extract the features of group members. Moreover, the feature extraction network is based on image patches, which solves the problem of group member alignment caused by occlusion within the group. To handle the large intra-ID variance resulting from changes in camera views, we add camera information to the model and propose the multi-grained camera-aware loss. For the problems of layout changes and membership changes, we adopt a person-to-group strategy. Specifically, we propose a novel group distance metric, named Modified Hausdorff Distance, to exploit the information of all the group members. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

ID DYNAMIC EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY
AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease. But if AD is detected early, it can greatly reduce the severity of the disease. Functional connection networks (FCNs) can be used for the early diagnosis of AD, but they are undirected graphs and lack the description of causal information. Moreover, most of FCNs take brain regions as nodes, and few studies have been carried out focusing on the connections of the brain network. Although effective connection networks (ECNs) are digraphs, they do not reflect the causal relationships between brain connections. Therefore, we innovatively pro -pose an edge-centric ECN (EECN) to explore the causality of the co-fluctuating connection in brain net-works. Firstly, the traditional conditional Granger causality (GC) method is improved for constructing ECNs based on the suppression relationship between structural connection network (SCN) and FCN. Then based on the improved GC method, edge time series and EECNs are constructed. Finally, we perform dichotomous tasks on four stages of AD to verify the accuracy of our proposed method. The results show that this method achieves good results in six classification tasks. Finally, we present some brain connec-tions that may be essential for early AD classification tasks. This study may have a positive impact on the application of brain networks.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate residential load forecasting (RLF) is of great significance for the decision-making and operation of modern power system. In literature, deep neural network (DNN) based RLF schemes have witnessed great development due to the advantage of automatically extracting features and capturing complex non-linear pattern in the presented data. However, most existed works separately exploit the historical data of a specific residential house to forecast its load. However, the electricity consumption behaviors among residential users are not independent, and implicitly have some correlations, which can be explicitly characterized and exploited to improve the accuracy of RLF forecasting. Inspired by this idea, through exploiting the multiple correlations among households, this paper proposes a novel residential load forecasting framework based on multiple correlation-temporal graph neural networks, RLF-MGNN. Specifically, the novelty of our work includes three aspects. First, multiple graphs are explicitly constructed to represent both linear and nonlinear correlations among temporal load series of households. That is, the synchronization graph is built to describe the degree of linear correlation between two households using Pearson correlation coefficient, which characterizes the similarity of their consumption behaviors, and the causality graph is built to describe their nonlinear correlation using transfer entropy, which characterizes the amount of directional information transfer from one time series to another, and models the mutual influence between households. Second, the multiple correlation-temporal graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are designed to forecast the residential users' loads. In detail, at each timestep, latent features are first extracted by corresponding GCNs to embed multiple correlations among households, and then are sent to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for further learning the latent temporal features. Finally, thorough experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLF-MGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art independent DNN based schemes and other GNN based schemes.

AB In this paper we propose a semantic analysis of Lewis' counterfactuals. By exploiting the structural properties of the recently introduced boolean algebras of conditionals, we show that counterfactuals can be expressed as formal combinations of a conditional object and a normal necessity modal operator. Specifically, we introduce a class of algebras that serve as modal expansions of boolean algebras of conditionals, together with their dual relational structures. Moreover, we show that Lewis' semantics based on sphere models can be reconstructed in this framework. As a consequence, we establish the soundness and completeness of a slightly stronger variant of Lewis' logic for counterfactuals with respect to our algebraic models. In the second part of the paper, we present a novel approach to the probability of counterfactuals showing that it aligns with the uncertainty degree assigned by a belief function, as per Dempster-Shafer theory, to its associated conditional formula. Furthermore, we characterize the probability of a counterfactual in terms of Gardenfors' imaging rule for the probabilistic update.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Our work targets the task of Incremental Few-Shot Detection (iFSD), which requires quickly detecting objects of novel classes after seeing only a few training examples, while maintaining the ability to detect old classes. Different from re-training a new detector to incorporate few-shot novel categories, we tackle iFSD in a direct weight generation way. Specifically, we propose to reorganize base weights by leveraging responses of novel region features, hence transferring learned information from base weights to the novel but relevant ones. To obtain representative region features for the novel weight generation, two strategies are further presented. The scale-aware strategy respects the scale variation in object detection, and assigns each object to its corresponding pyramid to obtain the scale-specific region feature. The centerness-aware strategy reorganizes region features in the spatial range, since the localization quality of each pixel on the feature map varies. Extensive experiments are conducted on the challenging MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, and our method achieves promising performances under various settings with a direct weight generation fashion. Furthermore, our generated weights can be used as good initialization for fine-tuning to induce faster convergence, thus mitigating the performance drop on old classes and improving overall results in the incremental setting.

AB The rapid increase in obtainable online text data has made text categorization an important tool for data analysts to extract relevant information on the web. However, incorrect or incomplete classification of marginalized groups may result from using biased text data. In order to remedy the disparity in available data, this research suggests a system for classifying and analyzing Bangla news articles. The suggested approach first uses both Random Under-Sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Techniques to balance the massive unbalanced Bangla News dataset consisting of 4,37,948 instances (SMOTE). Secondly, the proposed system employs three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Stochastic Gradient Descent along with three deep learning models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for Bangla text categorization. The experimental results signify the superior performance of BERT to other classification models of the system as well as other existing methods in this domain. The proposed system achieves the maximum accuracy of 99.04% in balanced dataset and 72.23% in imbalanced dataset using BERT. K-fold cross validation with varied K values is used to determine the performance consistency of BERT. Finally, both LIME (Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanations and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) techniques are applied for interpreting each prediction made by BERT.

AB With the emergence of new mutant corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) strains such as Delta and Omicron, the number of infected people in various countries has reached a new high. Accurate prediction of the number of infected people is of far-reaching sig Nificance to epidemiological prevention in all countries of the world. In order to improve the prediction accuracy of COVID-19 daily new case data, a new hybrid prediction model of COVID-19 is proposed, which consists of four modules: decomposition, complexity judgment, prediction and error correction. Firstly, singular spectrum decomposition is used to decompose the COVID-19 data into singular spectrum components (SSC). Secondly, the complexity judgment is innovatively divided into high -complexity SSC and low-complexity SSC by neural network estimation time entropy. Thirdly, an improved LSSVM by GODLIKE optimization algorithm, named GLSSVM, is proposed to improve its prediction accuracy. Then, each low-complexity SSC is predicted by ARIMA, and each high-complexity SSC is predicted by GLSSVM, and the prediction error of each high-complexity SSC is predicted by GLSSVM. Finally, the predicted results are combined and reconstructed. Simulation experiments in Japan, Germany and Russia show that the proposed model has the highest prediction accuracy and the lowest prediction error. Diebold Mariano (DM) test is introduced to evaluate the model comprehensively. Taking Japan as an example, compared with ARIMA prediction model, the RMSE, average error and MAPE of the proposed model are reduced by 93.17%, 91.42% and 81.20% respectively.

AB With the coming of intelligent manufacturing, multi-variety and small-batch production mode has gradually become popular. Aiming at the characteristics of high dimensional information and limited samples in this mode, a novel data-driven grey Weibull model is established for product quality prediction. Firstly, a high -dimensional information from the production process is integrated as the process variation using a data-driven method. Then, the quality prediction function is deducted by considering that process variation follows Weibull distribution-based mechanism, the Hausdorff difference scheme is adopted to weaken the error from the difference to the differential, heuristic algorithm is selected to optimize the distribution parameters of the model. Finally, an experimental analysis is designed using the dataset from some personalized customization manufacturer in China. Results show that the proposed model is not only superior to the other eight models in terms of stability and prediction accuracy, but also boasts the features of amalgamation of data-driven and mechanism-driven methods, which can simultaneously process high-dimensional information and limited samples in multi-variety and small-batch production system.

AB This article mainly explores fixed-time (FXT) synchronization of fully quaternion-valued memristive neural networks (QVMNNs) with generalized delays. Firstly, based on the set-valued mapping theory and the nonsmooth approach, the discontinuity of quaternion-valued memristive connection weights is successfully solved. Next, by introducing the signum function, absolute-like norm and quadratic norm in the quaternion field, a direct non-decomposing method is put forward. Under this framework, several exponential-type controllers are designed, which have only one exponential term and no longer contain the traditional linear part and the powerlaw terms. Compared with designing four real-value controllers, the control schemes proposed in this article are simpler in form. Besides, several criteria of FXT synchronization and the upper bound of the setting time are deduced based on Lyapunov method and Taylor expansion. Lastly, the achieved synchronization results are confirmed via numerical examples.

AB Convex-hull based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) maximization has become a hot research topic due to its significance in the study of imbalance binary classification. Recently, a series of multi objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed to maximize ROC convex hull by regarding it as a multi-objective optimization problem. However, in real applications, the ubiquitous label noises degrade the performance of the existing MOEAs. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a robust evolutionary optimization approach, named REO, to enhance the robustness of the existing MOEAs. In the proposed approach, we firstly design a distance-based samples selection method to extract a "clean"data subset, aiming to obtain an ideal individual. Second, with the ideal individual, a problem-oriented two-stage adaptive updating strategy is designed to guide the population evolution and enhance the robustness of MOEAs. Specifically, in the first stage, based on the achieved ideal individual, a bi-level evolution direction is constructed to provide the guidance for the evolution of population. In the second stage, we utilize the cosine similarity to assign different step sizes to adaptively update the inferior individuals. Experimental results on 19 complicated datasets with different noise levels show that the proposed REO approach can effectively enhance the robustness of the existing MOEAs for ROC convex hull maximization under the label noises.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dung's Argumentation Framework (AF) has been extended in several directions, including the possibility of representing uncertainty about the existence of arguments and attacks. In this regard, two main proposals have been introduced in the literature: Probabilistic Argumentation Framework (PrAF) and Incomplete Argumentation Framework (iAF). PrAF is an extension of AF with probability theory, thus representing quantified uncertainty. In contrast, iAF represents unquantified uncertainty, that is it can be seen as a special case where we only know that some elements (arguments or attacks) are uncertain. In this paper, we first address the problem of computing the probability that a given argument is accepted in PrAF. This is carried out by introducing the concept of probabilistic explanation for any given (probabilistic) extension. We show that the complexity of the problem is FP#P-hard and propose polynomial approximation algorithms with bounded additive error for PrAFs where odd-length cycles are forbidden. We investigate the approximate complexity of the related FP#P-hard problems of credulous and skeptical acceptance in PrAF, showing that they are generally harder than the problem of computing the probability that a given argument is accepted. Next we consider iAF and, after showing some equivalence properties among classes of iAFs, we study iAF as a special case of PrAF where uncertain elements have associated a probability equal to 1/2. Finally, given this result, we investigate the relationships between iAF acceptance problems and probabilistic acceptance in PrAF.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As reinforcement learning (RL) continues to improve and be applied in situations along-side humans, the need to explain the learned behaviors of RL agents to end-users becomes more important. Strategies for explaining the reasoning behind an agent's policy, called policy-level explanations, can lead to important insights about both the task and the agent's behaviors. Following this line of research, in this work, we propose a novel approach, named as CAPS, that summarizes an agent's policy in the form of a directed graph with natural language descriptions. A decision tree based clustering method is utilized to abstract the state space of the task into fewer, condensed states which makes the policy graphs more digestible to end-users. We then use the user-defined predicates to enrich the abstract states with semantic meaning. To introduce counterfactual state explanations to the policy graph, we first identify the critical states in the graph then develop a novel coun-terfactual explanation method based on action perturbation in those critical states. We gen-erate explanation graphs using CAPS on 5 RL tasks, using both deterministic and stochas-tic policies. We also evaluate the effectiveness of CAPS on human participants who are not RL experts in two user studies. When provided with our explanation graph, end-users are able to accurately interpret policies of trained RL agents 80% of the time, compared to 10% when provided with the next best baseline and 68.2% of users demonstrated an increase in their confidence in understanding an agent's behavior after provided with the counterfac-tual explanations.

AB Deep neural networks are inherently opaque and challenging to interpret. Unlike hand-crafted feature-based models, we struggle to comprehend the concepts learned and how they interact within these models. This understanding is crucial not only for debugging purposes but also for ensuring fairness in ethical decision-making. In our study, we conduct a post-hoc functional interpretability analysis of pretrained speech models using the probing framework (Hupkes et al., 2018). Specifically, we analyze utterance-level representations of speech models trained for various tasks such as speaker recognition and dialect identification. We conduct layer and neuron-wise analyses, probing for speaker, language, and channel properties. Our study aims to answer the following questions: (i) what information is captured within the representations? (ii) how is it represented and distributed? and (iii) can we identify a minimal subset of the network that possesses this information? Our results reveal several novel findings, including: (i) channel and gender information are distributed across the network, (ii) the information is redundantly available in neurons with respect to a task, (iii) complex properties such as dialectal information are encoded only in the task-oriented pretrained network, (iv) and is localized in the upper layers, (v) we can extract a minimal subset of neurons encoding the pre-defined property, (vi) salient neurons are sometimes shared between properties, (vii) our analysis highlights the presence of biases (for example gender) in the network. Our cross-architectural comparison indicates that: (i) the pretrained models capture speaker-invariant information, and (ii) CNN models are competitive with Transformer models in encoding various understudied properties.

AB In financial engineering, portfolio optimization has been of consistent interest. Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. Despite numerous studies on shallow learning models, they have shown limited success in analyzing the complex nature of massive stock data, a task where recent deep learning models excel. However, the deterministic nature of conventional deep learning models impedes their consideration of portfolio risk due to an inherent lack of uncertainty quantification in their predictions. This paper proposes a novel portfolio weighting strategy, incorporating both risk and return considerations within a deep learning framework. We propose the Predictive Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (PredACGAN), a probabilistic deep learning model, to measure prediction uncertainty. The PredACGAN generator leverages latent vectors and historical stock prices to predict future returns. The model synthesizes predictive distributions from various latent vectors and past prices. The associated risk is produced via the entropy of these distributions, facilitating portfolio optimization through both return and risk considerations. The proposed algorithm removes high-risk assets from the investment universe at rebalancing moments, enabling PredACGAN to optimize portfolios considering both return and risk. We evaluated PredACGAN and the accompanying algorithm with S & P 500 stocks from 1990 to 2020, with portfolios rebalanced monthly based on PredACGAN predictions and risk measures. The PredACGAN portfolios yielded 9.123% annual returns and a 1.054 Sharpe ratio, outperforming a risk-agnostic portfolio yielding 1.024% annual returns and a 0.236 Sharpe ratio. The PredACGAN portfolio also exhibited lower maximum drawdowns, highlighting its effectiveness.

AB Sensors of an aircraft engine have the problems of multiple kinds of faults and difficulty to diagnose. Moreover, the diagnosis performance cannot meet practical demands. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel approach for sensor fault diagnosis integrating the advantages of selective ensemble learning, siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN), and Bayesian interval estimation (BIE). The Bayesian interval estimation with hypothesis testing is developed with real-time data update to reduce the confidence interval. The attention mechanism is introduced to enhance fault diagnosis performance. Moreover, ensemble selection learning with Akaike information criteria is proposed to obtain optimal SCNNs. The theorems of convergence and optimal confidence data in ensemble learning are proven. Furthermore, this paper develops a novel improved learning algorithm based on AdaMod (Adaptive and momental bound method) and SGD (stochastic gradient descent), and achieves a new fault diagnosis algorithm to improve the diagnosis performance. The sensor data of aircraft engines from China Eastern Airlines is adopted for validation and experimental results show that proposed approach reaches an excellent tradeoff between sensor diagnosis performance, confidence interval, and runtime. The ablation studies are performed to analyze the role of leaner's components. The proposed method improves training accuracy by 6.2%, fault diagnosis performance by 5.1%, fault prediction mean result by 4.6%, and fault prediction variance is reduced by 38.1% than the state-of-the-art methods.

AB Instrumented indentation test (IIT) is regarded as one of the non-destructive test methods for mechanical characterization and safety assessment of engineering components. However, indentation test is very sensitive to surface topography i.e surface roughness, requiring specimens with ideally flat and smooth surface for pro-ducing reliable and reproducible test results. Recently, a dual flat-spherical indentation (DFSI) technique was proposed to extract material properties directly from rough metallic surface via indentation tests. Integration of DFSI technique with machine learning (ML) approach can facilitate reliable and fast characterization of rough metallic surfaces. Here, ML models including artificial neural network (ANN) and physics-informed artificial neural network (PI-ANN) are established, and then trained by using a database of indentation parameters generated via DFSI simulations. Spherical indentation techniques available in the literature are used to calculate the physics-informed loss in the PI-ANN model. The performances of trained ANN and PI -ANN models are compared, and an optimal ML model with hyperparameters is suggested based on validation study; PI-ANN model with sigmoid activation function shows a better performance than the ANN model and baseline model. The model performances are evaluated by performing DFSI experiments with SM45C and SS304. The applicability of ML based-DFSI method is demonstrated for extracting the mechanical properties from the rough surface of general metals.

TI Image captioning using transformer-based double attention network
SO ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Self-attention; Transformer; Image captioning; Encoder-decoder
AB Image captioning generates a human-like description for a query image, which has attracted considerable attention recently. The most broadly utilized model for image description is an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder extracts the visual information of the image, and the decoder generates textual descriptions of the image. Transformers have significantly enhanced the performance of image description models. However, a single attention structure in transformers cannot consider more complex relationships between key and query vectors. Furthermore, attention weights are assigned to entire candidate vectors based on the assumption that entire vectors are related. In this paper, a new double-attention framework is presented, which improves the encoder-decoder structure to consider image captioning problems. Hence, a local generator module and a global generator module are designed to predict textual descriptions collaboratively. The proposed approach improves Self-Attention (SA) from two aspects to enhance the performance of image description. First, a Masked Self-Attention module is presented to attend on the most relevant information. Second, to evade a single shallow attention distribution and make deeper internal relations, a Hybrid Weight Distribution (HWD) module is proposed, that develops SA to use the relations between key and query vectors efficiently. Experiments over the Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets prove that the proposed approach achieves desirable performance on different evaluation measures compared to the state-of-the-art frameworks.

AB Pre-training has shown success in different areas of machine learning, such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and medical imaging. However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. An immense amount of clinical records are recorded, but still, data and labels can be scarce for data collected in small hospitals or dealing with rare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of unlabeled clinical data could improve performance. In this paper, we propose novel unsupervised pre-training techniques designed for heterogeneous, multi-modal clinical data for patient outcome prediction inspired by masked language modeling (MLM), by leveraging graph deep learning over population graphs. To this end, we further propose a graph-transformer-based network, designed to handle heterogeneous clinical data. By combining masking-based pre-training with a transformer-based network, we translate the success of masking -based pre-training in other domains to heterogeneous clinical data. We show the benefit of our pre-training method in a self-supervised and a transfer learning setting, utilizing three medical datasets TADPOLE, MIMIC -III, and a Sepsis Prediction Dataset. We find that our proposed pre-training methods help in modeling the data at a patient and population level and improve performance in different fine-tuning tasks on all datasets.

AB Finite-time synchronization and its settling-time estimation has been a hot topic in fields of science and engineering. This paper proposes a unified control framework to study the multiple finite-time synchronization of delayed competitive neural networks (DCNNs). Firstly, a more comprehensive finite-time framework lemma is systematically established. Compared with existing finite-time control method, the proposed framework involves several kinds of synchronization results and it enhances the estimation of settling-time. Then, based on the control framework, the finite-time, fixed-time and preassigned-time synchronization of DCNNs can be achieved simultaneously by modifying the controller parameters. Finally, numerical example and image encryption application are presented to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the deduced results.

ID OPTIMIZER
AB Multimodal multi-objective problems (MMOPs) arise frequently in the real world, in which multiple Pareto optimal solution sets correspond to the same point on the Pareto front. To find more equivalent Pareto sets, numerous multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MMEAs) based on niching have been developed. However, traditional niching methods have parameter sensitivity issues. Moreover, most existing MMEAs always perform diversity maintenance operations in the decision space and the objective space sequentially based on preferences, without considering a diversity maintenance operation that takes into account both the decision space and the objective space simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, a multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with two-stage double indicator selection strategy (MMEA-TDI) is developed. First, a dual-indicator with adaptive niche radius is developed to estimate the crowding status of the population. Then, a diversity-based mating selection is suggested to select well-distributed parents for mating. Furthermore, the environmental selection is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a parameter -free automatic niching technique based on clustering is adopted to well balance diversity and convergence in the decision space, while a double indicator selection strategy is performed for maintaining diversity in both decision and objective spaces in the second stage. To assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on the well-known benchmark functions, in comparison with eight state -of-the-art MMEAs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is significantly superior to the competing algorithms.

   Frechet distance; Evaluation; Measure
AB Evaluation measures of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been an active area of research and, currently, there are several measures to evaluate them. The most used GANs evaluation measure is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Measures such as FID are known as model-agnostic methods, where the generator is used as a black box to sample the generated images. Like other measures of model-agnostic, FID uses a deep supervised model for mapping real and generated samples to a feature space. We proposed an approach here with a deep unsupervised model, the Vector Quantised-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), for estimating the mean and the covariance matrix of the Frechet Distance and named it Frechet AutoEncoder Distance (FAED). Our experimental results highlighted that the feature space of the VQ-VAE describes a clustering domain-specific representation more intuitive and visually plausible than the Inception network used by the benchmark FID.

TI Instance-specific algorithm configuration via unsupervised deep graph

AB Instance-specific Algorithm Configuration (AC) methods are effective in automatically generating high-quality algorithm parameters for heterogeneous NP-hard problems from multiple sources. However, existing works rely on manually designed features to describe training instances, which are simple numerical attributes and cannot fully capture structural differences. Targeting at Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers, this paper proposes a novel instances-specific AC method based on end-to-end deep graph clustering. By representing an MIP instance as a bipartite graph, a random walk algorithm is designed to extract raw features with both numerical and structural information from the instance graph. Then an auto-encoder is designed to learn dense instance embeddings unsupervisedly, which facilitates clustering heterogeneous instances into homogeneous clusters for training instance-specific configurations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method can improve the solving efficiency of CPLEX on highly heterogeneous instances, and outperform existing instance specific AC methods.

AB A key issue in evolutionary algorithms for dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) is how to detect and response environmental changes. Most existing evolutionary algorithms use a single strategy for this purpose. However, single strategy is not always effective. In this paper, we propose a multi-strategy dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with hybrid change response (MDMEA-HCR) to solve DMOPs. Our proposed algorithm not only provides a new way for handling dynamics in DMOPs, but also introduce a static multi-objective optimizer based on a multi-strategy evolutionary operator. More specifically, we propose a hybrid environmental change response mechanism to integrate several strategies for prediction and response adjustments. When the environment changes, the hybrid environmental change response strategy makes an initial response to the change, and then the response adjustment mechanism improves the quality of the response population and adjusts its optimization direction to achieve fast tracking of Pareto optimal sets and Pareto optimal fronts in the new environment. During the static optimal optimization phase, a variable neighbor-based multi-strategy evolutionary operator is used to generate new solutions, it is very helpful for both convergence and diversity preservation. MDMEA-HCR has been compared with some other advanced DMOEAs on 31 test instances. Experimental results show that MDMEA-HCR performs better than others on

AB Camera pose tracking attracts much interest from both academic and industrial communities, of which the methods based on planar markers are easy to be implemented. However, most existing methods need to identify multiple points in the marker images for matching to space points. Then, PnP methods are used to compute the camera poses. If cameras move fast or are far away from the markers, the matching is easy to generate errors. To address these problems, we design circular markers and represent 6D camera pose analytically as concise forms from each marker by projective invariance. Afterwards, the pose is further optimized by a cost function based on a polar-n-direction geometric distance. The proposed method is from imaged circular edges, which makes camera pose tracking more robust to noise, blur and distance from camera to marker than existing methods. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed 6-DoF camera pose tracking method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of noise, blur, and distance from camera to marker. Simultaneously, it efficiently runs at about 100 FPS on a consumer computer.

AB Cut-Test technique employs visual inspection of interior coloration, compartmentalization, and defects of beans for effective classification of cocoa beans. However, due to its subjective nature and natural variations in visual perception, it is intrinsically limited, resulting in disparities in verdicts, imprecision, discordance, and time-consuming and labor-intensive classification procedures. Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been proposed to address these challenges with significant results, but there is still a need for improvement. In this paper, we propose a color and texture extraction technique for image representation, as well as a generalized, less complex Neural Network model, to help improve the performance of machine classification of Cut-Test cocoa beans. A total of 1400 beans were classified into 14 grades. Experimental results on the equal cocoa cut-test dataset, which is the standard publicly available cut-test dataset, show that the novel extraction method combined with the developed Artificial Neural Networks provides a more homogeneous classification rate for all grades, obtaining 85.36%, 85%, 83%, and 83% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measure, respectively. The proposed model outperforms other ML models, such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Naive Bayes, on the same dataset. Additionally, the proposed ANN model demonstrates relatively better generalization when compared with earlier work by Santos on the same dataset. The proposed techniques in this work are robust on the cut-test dataset and can serve as an accurate Computer-Aided Diagnostic tool for cocoa bean classification.

AB Original synthetic content writing is one of the human abilities that algorithms aspire to emulate. The advent of sophisticated algorithms, especially based on neural networks has shown promising results in recent times. A watershed moment was witnessed when the attention mechanism was introduced which paved the way for transformers, a new exciting architecture in natural language processing. Recent sensations like GPT and BERT for synthetic text generation rely on NLP transformers. Although, GPT and BERT-based models are capable of generating creative text given they are properly trained on abundant data, however, the generated text suffers the quality aspect when limited data is available. This is especially an issue for low-resource languages where labeled data is still scarce. In such cases, the generated text, more often than not, lacks the proper sentence structure, thus unreadable. This study proposes a post-processing step in text generation that improves the quality of generated text through the GPT model. The proposed post-processing step is based on the analysis of POS tagging patterns in the original text and accepts only those generated sentences from GPT which satisfy POS patterns that are originally learned from the data. We exploit the GPT model to generate English headlines by utilizing Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) news dataset. Furthermore, for assessing the applicability of the model in low-resource languages, we also train the model on the Urdu news dataset for Urdu news headlines generation. The experiments presented in this paper on these datasets from high- and lowresource languages show that the performance of generated headlines has a significant improvement by using the proposed headline POS pattern extraction. We evaluate the performance through subjective evaluation as well as using text generation quality metrics like BLEU and ROUGE.

AB Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, existing methods are less accurate and prone to overlooking lesions during gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations. Computer-assisted diagnosis combined with robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) can significantly help medical practitioners detect and treat lesions. Therefore, two novel architectures are developed for polyp and surgical instrument segmentation to aid colorectal cancer diagnosis, assessment, and treatment. Colorectal cancer segmentation network (CCS-Net) is the base network used in this study. It uses the maximum convolutional layers near the input image for effective feature extraction from low-level information. In addition, CCS-Net uses an efficient feature upsampling unit to efficiently increase the input spatial features' map size. Hence, CCS-Net is capable of providing a fair performance with satisfactory computational efficiency The multi-scale feature retention and aggregation network (MFRA-Net) is the final network in this study. MFRA-Net is developed to improve the segmentation accuracy of the CCS-Net further as it uses multi-scale feature retention to retain low-level spatial features and transfers them to deep stages of the network. MFRANet also combines multi-scale high-strided low-level information with high-level information to boost network segmentation performance. Finally, all the transferred multi-scale features from the early stages of the network are aggregated with high-level features in the deep levels of the network. This multi-scale feature retention and aggregation mechanism enables the network to maintain a better segmentation performance compared with other methods even with challenging blur, specular reflection, low contrast, and high variation cases. We evaluated both architectures on four challenging datasets: Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-Instrument, and the UW-Sinus-Surgery-Live dataset. The proposed method achieves dice similarity coefficients of 95.98%, 94.19%, 92.81%, and 88.57% for the CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, Kvasir-Instrument, and UW-Sinus-Surgery-Live datasets. The proposed method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods and requires only 4.9 million trainable parameters for complete training. Therefore, the proposed networks can effectively assist health professionals in surgical procedures and colorectal cancer diagnosis through surgical instruments and polyp segmentation, respectively.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) maneuver strategy learning remains a challenge when using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in this sparse reward task. In this paper, we propose Subtask-Masked curriculum learning for RL (SubMas-RL), an efficient RL paradigm that implements curriculum learning and knowledge transfer for UAV maneuver scenarios involving multiple missiles. First, this study introduces a novel concept known as subtask mask to create source tasks from a target task by masking partial subtasks. Then, a subtask-masked curriculum generation method is proposed to generate a sequenced curriculum by alternately conducting task generation and task sequencing. To establish efficient knowledge transfer and avoid negative transfer, this paper employs two transfer techniques, policy distillation and policy reuse, along with an explicit transfer condition that masks irrelevant knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a 94.8% success rate in the UAV maneuver scenario, where the direct use of reinforcement learning always fails. The proposed RL framework SubMas-RL is expected to learn an effective policy in complex tasks with sparse rewards.

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB Human-machine interface (HMI) design evaluation is critical in interactive product development because it directly affects the cost of subsequent design and user experiments. The evaluation information of HMI design mainly depends on the subjective perception and preference of experts, especially the hesitancy degree is rarely considered. We propose an integrated spherical fuzzy AHP (SF-AHP) and spherical fuzzy axiomatic design (SF-AD) method to choose a reasonable HMI alternative, considering the potential risks caused by the hesitancy degree of experts. Firstly, we introduce a process of automatically repairing inconsistent spherical fuzzy preference relations (SFPR) for SF-AHP. After that, we build suitable evaluation criteria and calculate the criteria weight by the SF-AHP method. We further extend the axiomatic design to the spherical fuzzy environment and propose a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method based on SF-AD to evaluate HMI alternatives. The case analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the HMI design evaluation process, and the sensitivity and comparative analysis results indicate that the proposed method is stable and reliable.

AB In order to reduce the construction risk caused by human operation error and improve the geological adaptive ability of the shield machine, an autonomous intelligent control method is proposed for shield machine within the framework of interaction-judgment-decision based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement learning in this study. Due to the strong nonlinear relationship between the shield machine's tunneling parameters, this research builds a deep reinforcement learning environment using mechanism model of sealed cabin pressure. DDPG agent model of the shield machine is established to replace the shield machine to interact and train with the geological environment. By minimizing the difference between the target pressure setting value and the sealed cabin pressure value, the dynamic balance between the sealed cabin pressure and the pressure on the excavation surface is realized, and the best strategy is obtained. Through real-time interaction with the geological environment, the method in this paper can dynamically adjust the tunneling parameters, accurately control the sealed cabin pressure, and has a strong geological adaptive ability. By realizing the intelligent decision-making of the tunneling parameters, it greatly improves the independent decision-making ability of the shield machine system, reduces the inaccuracy of human operation, and provides an effective guarantee for the efficient and safe operation of the shield machine. This study applies deep reinforcement learning technology to the control field of earth pressure balance shield machine, promotes AI technology, and provides a new idea for the development of AI construction technology in engineering field.

AB Feature engineering for high-frequency financial data based on constructing dynamic data subsets, defined by time intervals in which high-frequency trends occur, is proposed. These intervals are obtained through time series segmentation. This methodology allows us to extract and analyze variables by intraday trends as well as to feed artificial intelligence models to forecast response variables in future trends. Furthermore, to show how to use this feature engineering, this methodology is applied to estimate high-frequency volatility, duration and direction linked to future intraday trends, developing multiclass classification models based on the machine learning method extreme gradient boosting. Experimentation was conducted using high-frequency financial data from the Brazil Stock Exchange, corresponding to 206 trading days related to 20 listed assets from this financial market.

AB Accurate and reliable ship price forecasts can assist shipping firms, investors, and other participants to withstand risks and make profits in a highly volatile shipping market. Considering the nonlinear behavior and sophisticated interrelationship of the shipping market, in this paper, a novel multiscale and multivariable methodology based on multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and machine learning (ML) algorithms is proposed for forecasting monthly newbuilding ship price (NSP), secondhand ship price (SSP), and ship scrap value (SSV). The proposed methodology involves three main modules: (1) data decomposition by MVMD; (2) mode forecasting using ML algorithms, including multi-layer perceptron, support vector regression, long short-term memory, and gated recurrent unit; and (3) ensemble forecasts via simple addition. The novelty of this paper lies in the employment of MVMD, which is capable of capturing complicated multiscale relationships among the NSP, SSP, and SSV data by extracting multiple frequency-aligned oscillatory modes. This will largely help in the multivariable forecasting of ship prices at each timescale. With Capesize bulker and VLCC tanker as study samples, the empirical results show that the novel methodology outperforms other considered benchmark models in terms of both level and directional forecasting accuracy. This suggests that the developed multiscale and multivariable methodology is a promising alternative for shipping market analysis and forecasting.

AB The fully distributed time-varying formation (TVF) control problem is investigated for multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. An asynchronous dynamic event-triggering (DET) mechanism is introduced to alleviate agents' communication burden suitably, and a fully distributed DET-TVF control protocol is designed. Sufficient conditions and theoretical analysis prove that this protocol can achieve the desired TVF configuration under DoS attacks, and Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, experimental examples using six quadrotors demonstrate and fully showcase the efficacy of the proposed methods.

DE Emotion recognition; Word embedding fine-tuning; BERT
AB Emotion recognition has received considerable attention in recent years, with the popularity of social media. It is noted, however, that the state-of-the-art language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) may not produce the best performance in emotion recognition. We found the main cause of the problem is that the embedding of emotional words from the pre-trained BERT model may not exhibit high between-class difference and within-class similarity. While BERT model fine-tuning is a common practice when it is applied to specific tasks, this may not be practical in emotion recognition because most datasets are small and some texts are short and noisy, without containing much useful contextual information. In this paper, we propose to use the knowledge of emotion vocabulary to fine-tune embedding of emotional words. As a separate module independent of the embedding learning model, the fine-tuning model aims to produce emotional word embedding with improved within-class similarity and between-class difference. By combining the emotionally discriminative fine-tuned embedding with contextual information-rich embedding from pre-trained BERT model, the emotional features underlying the texts could be more effectively captured in the subsequent feature learning module, which in turn leads to improved emotion recognition performance. The knowledgebased word embedding fine-tuning model is tested on five datasets of emotion recognition, and the results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB To study the role of perceptual cues on categorization and decision making, participants are typically tested in (perception) experiments with a fixed set of randomized or pseudo-randomized trials. In linguistics and psycholinguistics, for instance, studies often investigate the relative weighting of different cues for a linguistic contrast (e.g., intonation vs. word order). For categorization beyond the segmental level (e.g., /p/ vs. /b/), it is important to establish that results generalise to different words or sentences, which necessitates the use of a range of different items. This may limit the number of conditions (cues and cue combinations) that can be sensibly tested in the same experiment. We show that Active Learning (AL) systems provide a solution: Since stimulus selection is informed by the system's learning mechanism (presenting certain conditions less often than uncertain conditions), they allow for efficient testing of numerous conditions and different items in the same experiment. In this paper, we compared two weighting approaches (average probability-based vs. regression-based) to model the outcome of three simulated scenarios with three binary factors each. Results show that valid results (i.e., little error between predicted values and the actual responses at the end of the experiment) are obtained after about a third of the trials of an original psycholinguistic experiment we replicated. For simulations with interactions between factors, the regression-based approach performed better. Our findings bear implications for the application of AL in psycholinguistic research (extraction of cue weights, inferential statistics, and a stopping criterion during an on-going experiment), which we will discuss.

AB Nowadays deep learning-based models have made encouraging accomplishments in the field of image motion deblurring, but this type of algorithms does not effectively use the known prior knowledge and the physical model of motion blur. So as to settle the above disputes, this paper suggests a multi-patch multi-scale input model that fuses high-frequency information, structural self-similarity (SSS), multi-scale channel spatial attention (MSCSA), and superpixel gradient loss for motion deblurring. The multi-patch multi-scale input model can fully extract the salient information, scale information, and high-frequency information of the image to restore the sharp image. The SSS module can take full advantage of the prior information of the structure self similarity of the image. And the MSCSA module dynamically and selectively enhances relevant features and suppresses irrelevant features by fusing spatial, scale, and channel characteristics. Moreover, this paper advises a superpixel gradient loss function, which can remove motion blur and restore sharp images more effectively. And to increase the diversity of scenes, for the first time, we propose a motion blur dataset (Underwater-Blur) specifically for underwater scenes. Massive comparative experiments conducted on three public datasets of GoPro, RealBlur, RWBI, and the Underwater-Blur dataset prove that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of comprehensive performance.

AB Joint sparse coding (JSC) and coupled dictionary learning (CDL) have been successful in visible and infrared image fusion tasks. However, JSC fusion methods using a single dictionary cannot perfectly characterize different modal signals. The CDL-based fusion methods ignore the role of high-frequency components in texture preservation and sharpness. In this study, we design fusion rules while considering the uniqueness and connection of different feature spaces to alleviate this issue. In the proposed fusion method, coupled dictionaries are first used to establish the relationship between infrared and visible images. Then, we use joint sparse coding and coupled dictionaries to calculate sparse coefficients via the joint sparse model. Finally, the improved coefficient fusion strategy realizes the conversion and synthesis between different spatial images. Experimental results on the TNO and RoadScene datasets show that the proposed method achieves promising results in terms of objective and subjective performance compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Clustering has been widely employed for extracting intrinsic groups because of its low reliance on domain knowledge. Though several clustering techniques have been developed in the literature, the majority of them become inefficient due to their dependence on user-defined parameters or inability to cluster multi-scale datasets. To handle these issues, several hybrid clustering algorithms which combine the advantages of partitional, hierarchical, and graph-based clustering techniques have been developed. Hybrid clustering algorithms first partition the data into smaller clusters and then merge them into genuine clusters. However, most of them incur a quadratic time complexity which limits their application for large datasets. The proposed work presents a two-step fast hybrid clustering algorithm based on partitions and efficient merging to reduce the computational cost by maintaining the clustering quality. In the first step, the dispersion of the data is considered to produce balanced partitions. Then graph circumference proximity-based merging technique is proposed to merge the sub-clusters. The overall computational complexity of the algorithm is O(N lg N) where N is the number of data points, ignoring the dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the fastest known graph neighborhood-based hybrid clustering algorithm. Experimental results on various diversified datasets exhibit a significant improvement in the running time as well as cluster quality and robustness against noise.

ID GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORK; RAINDROP REMOVAL
AB In the past few years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the primary workhorse for image restoration tasks. However, the deficiency of modeling long-range dependencies due to the local computational property of convolution greatly limits the restoration performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage progressive convolutional Transformer to recursively restore the degraded images, termed PCformer, which enjoys a high capability for capturing local context and global dependencies with friendly computational cost. Specifically, each stage of PCformer is an asymmetric encoder-decoder network whose bottleneck is built upon a tailored Transformer block with convolution operation deployed to avoid any loss of local context. Both encoder and decoder are convolution-based modules, thus allowing to explore rich contextualized information for image recovery. Taking the low-resolution features encoded by the encoder as tokens input into the Transformer bottleneck guarantees that long-range pixel interactions are captured while reducing the computational burden. Meanwhile, we apply a gated module for filtering redundant information propagation between every two phases. In addition, long-range enhanced inpainting is further introduced to mining the ability of PCformer to exploit distant complementary features. Extensive experiments yield superior results and in particular establishing new state-of-the-art results on several image restoration tasks, including deraining (+0.37 dB on Rain13K), denoising (+0.11 dB on DND), dehazing (+0.56 dB on I-HAZE), enhancement (+0.72 dB on SICE), and shadow removal (+0.65 RMSE on ISTD). The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Jeasco/PCformer.

ID PERSON REIDENTIFICATION
AB Marine vessel re-identification technology is an important component of intelligent shipping systems and an important part of the visual perception tasks required for marine surveillance. However, unlike the situation on land, the maritime environment is complex and volatile, and ships are prone to different degrees of swaying. Warships, as a class of ships, are characterized by fewer image samples and high similarity, and it is more difficult to re-identify warships at sea. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic alignment re-identification network model incorporating transfer learning methods. Various types of ships are used as source domain data to assist the network in learning the target domain warships so as to improve the recognition accuracy of warships. At the same time, the swaying situation of warships at sea is simulated and tested to improve the recognition difficulty so as to cope with the impact caused by complex sea conditions. The effect of different types of ships as transfer objects is also discussed. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm improves the mean average accuracy (mAP) by 10.2% and the first hit rate (Rank1) by 4.9% on average.

AB Due to the cross-domain distribution shift aroused from diverse medical imaging systems, many deep learning segmentation methods fail to perform well on unseen data, which limits their real-world applicability. Recent works have shown the benefits of extracting domain-invariant representations on domain generalization. However, the interpretability of domain-invariant features remains a great challenge. To address this problem, we propose an interpretable Bayesian framework (BayeSeg) through Bayesian modeling of image and label statistics to enhance model generalizability for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first decompose an image into a spatial-correlated variable and a spatial-variant variable, assigning hierarchical Bayesian priors to explicitly force them to model the domain-stable shape and domain-specific appearance information respectively. Then, we model the segmentation as a locally smooth variable only related to the shape. Finally, we develop a variational Bayesian framework to infer the posterior distributions of these explainable variables. The framework is implemented with neural networks, and thus is referred to as deep Bayesian segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on prostate segmentation and cardiac segmentation tasks have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method. Moreover, we investigated the interpretability of BayeSeg by explaining the posteriors and analyzed certain factors that affect the generalization ability through further ablation studies. Our code is released via https://zmiclab.github.io/projects.html.

ID INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY
AB Radiotherapy is a mainstay treatment for cancer in clinic. An excellent radiotherapy treatment plan is always based on a high-quality dose distribution map which is produced by repeated manual trial-and-errors of expe-rienced experts. To accelerate the radiotherapy planning process, many automatic dose distribution prediction methods have been proposed recently and achieved considerable fruits. Nevertheless, these methods require certain auxiliary inputs besides CT images, such as segmentation masks of the tumor and organs at risk (OARs), which limits their prediction efficiency and application potential. To address this issue, we design a novel approach named as TransDose for dose distribution prediction that treats CT images as the unique input in this paper. Specifically, instead of inputting the segmentation masks to provide the prior anatomical information, we utilize a super-pixel-based graph convolutional network (GCN) to extract category-specific features, thereby compensating the network for the necessary anatomical knowledge. Besides, considering the strong continuous dependency between adjacent CT slices as well as adjacent dose maps, we embed the Transformer into the backbone, and make use of its superior ability of long-range sequence modeling to endow input features with inter-slice continuity message. To our knowledge, this is the first network that specially designed for the task of dose prediction from only CT images without ignoring necessary anatomical structure. Finally, we evaluate our model on two real datasets, and extensive experiments demonstrate the generalizability and advantages of our method.

ID DIAGNOSIS; SEGMENTATION
AB Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly using whole slide images (WSIs) for tumor diagnosis and analysis have attracted considerable attention, because they only utilize the slide-level label for model training without any additional annotations. However, it is still a challenging task to directly handle gigapixel WSIs, due to the billions of pixels and intra-variations in each WSI. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end interpretable deep MIL framework for WSI analysis, by using a two-branch deep neural network and a multi-scale representation attention mechanism to directly extract features from all patches of each WSI. Specifically, we first divide each WSI into bag-, patch-and cell-level images, and then assign the slide-level label to its corresponding bag-level images, so that WSI classification becomes a MIL problem. Additionally, we design a novel multi-scale representation attention mechanism, and embed it into a two-branch deep network to simultaneously mine the bag with a correct label, the significant patches and their cell-level information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework over recent state-of-the-art methods, in term of classification accuracy and model interpretability.

AB System optimum (SO) routing, wherein the total travel time of all users is minimized, is a holy grail for transportation authorities. However, SO routing may discriminate against users who incur much larger travel times than others to achieve high system efficiency, i.e., low total travel times. To address the inherent unfairness of SO routing, we study the fl-fair SO problem whose goal is to minimize the total travel time while guaranteeing a fl = 1 level of unfairness, which specifies the maximum possible ratio between the travel times of different users with shared origins and destinations. To obtain feasible solutions to the fl-fair SO problem while achieving high system efficiency, we develop a new convex program, the interpolated traffic assignment problem (I-TAP), which interpolates between a fairness-promoting and an efficiency-promoting traffic-assignment objective. We evalu-ate the efficacy of I-TAP through theoretical bounds on the total system travel time and level of unfairness in terms of its interpolation parameter, as well as present a numerical comparison between I-TAP and a state-of-the-art algorithm on a range of transportation networks. The numerical results indicate that our approach is faster by several orders of magnitude as compared to the benchmark algorithm, while achieving higher system effi-ciency for all desirable levels of unfairness. We further leverage the structure of I-TAP to develop two pricing mechanisms to collectively enforce the I-TAP solution in the presence of selfish homogeneous and heterogeneous users, respectively, that independently choose routes to minimize their own travel costs.

AB In response to COVID-19, many countries have mandated social distancing and banned large group gatherings in order to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These social interventions along with vaccines remain the best way forward to reduce the spread of SARS CoV-2. In order to increase vaccine accessibility, states such as Virginia have deployed mobile vaccination centers to distribute vaccines across the state. When choosing where to place these sites, there are two important factors to take into account: accessibility and equity. We formulate a combinatorial problem that captures these factors and then develop efficient algorithms with theoretical guarantees on both of these aspects. Furthermore, we study the inherent hardness of the problem, and demonstrate strong impossibility results. Finally, we run computational experiments on real-world data to show the efficacy of our methods.

AB Recent studies suggest that automatic speech analysis is promising for diagnosing movement and cognitive disorders. However, the reliability of acoustic and linguistic measures receives insuf-ficient research efforts. The present study examines the test-retest reliability of commonly used acoustic and linguistic features in a healthy Chinese adult sample. Forty healthy young adults participated in the study and received seven frequently used speech tests twice, separated by 2-3 days. Fifty-six acoustic and linguistic features were extracted for each participant. The test-retest reliabilities of those features were then estimated using the intra-class correlation (ICC) method. The frequency-related, spectral, diadochokinetic (diadochokinetic rate, voice onset time), and content length features showed acceptable absolute agreement between the two test sessions. Articulation tasks (sustained vowel pronunciation, diadochokinetic rate) provided more reliable features than cognitive tasks such as picture descriptions. However, approximately half of those features failed to reach a moderate reliability requirement. There were no gender differences in the reliability estimates. We suggest increasing trial numbers or using multiple tests to increase the reliability of automated speech tests.

DE Face photo-sketch translation; Semi-supervised; Cycle-GAN; Steganography
AB The performance of face photo-sketch translation has improved a lot thanks to deep neural networks. GAN based methods trained on paired images can produce high-quality results under laboratory settings. Such paired datasets are, however, often very small and lack diversity. Meanwhile, Cycle-GANs trained with unpaired photo-sketch datasets suffer from the steganography phenomenon, which makes them not effective to face photos in the wild. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised approach with a noise-injection strategy, named Semi-Cycle-GAN (SCG), to tackle these problems. For the first problem, we propose a pseudo sketch feature representation for each input photo composed from a small reference set of photo-sketch pairs, and use the resulting pseudo pairs to supervise a photo-to-sketch generator ������������2 ������. The outputs of ������������2 ������ can in turn help to train a sketch-to-photo generator ������������2 ������ in a self-supervised manner. This allows us to train ������������2 ������ and ������������2 ������ using a small reference set of photo-sketch pairs together with a large face photo dataset (without ground-truth sketches). For the second problem, we show that the simple noise-injection strategy works well to alleviate the steganography effect in SCG and helps to produce more reasonable sketch-to-photo results with less overfitting than fully supervised approaches. Experiments show that SCG achieves competitive performance on public benchmarks and superior results on photos in the wild.

AB For mobile robots to operate in an autonomous and safe manner they must be able to adequately perceive their environment despite challenging or unpredictable conditions in their sensory apparatus. Usually, this is addressed through ad-hoc, not easily generalizable Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) approaches. In this work, we leverage Bayesian Networks (BNs) to propose a novel probabilistic inference architecture that provides generality, rigorous inferences and real-time performance for the detection, diagnosis and recovery of diverse and multiple sensory failures in robotic systems. Our proposal achieves all these goals by structuring a BN in a multidimensional setting that up to our knowledge deals coherently and rigorously for the first time with the following issues: modeling of complex interactions among the components of the system, including sensors, anomaly detection and recovery; representation of sensory information and other kinds of knowledge at different levels of cognitive abstraction; and management of the temporal evolution of sensory behavior. Real-time performance is achieved through the compilation of these BNs into feedforward neural networks. Our proposal has been implemented and tested for mobile robot navigation in environments with human presence, a complex task that involves diverse sensor anomalies. The results obtained from both simulated and real experiments prove that our architecture enhances the safety and robustness of robotic operation: among others, the minimum distance to pedestrians, the tracking time and the navigation time all improve statistically in the presence of anomalies, with a diversity of changes in medians ranging from & SIME; 20% to & SIME; 500%.

AB The microgrid market is growing significantly due to several drivers, such as the need to lower greenhouse gas emissions by integrating higher shares of distributed renewable energy sources, falling costs of microgrid components, the need for more reliable power supply infrastructures, and new off-grid solutions to foster electricity access in developing economies. Coordinated management of the microgrid components is crucial for their effectiveness, and this can be very challenging when hosting solar or wind generation. This paper studies the energy management problem of a microgrid based on reinforcement learning algorithms. The advantage of using these algorithms against other optimization and machine learning techniques is that they do not need past experiences to learn a strategy. The learning is based on trial and error experiences, which facilitates its easy implementation to other microgrids while demonstrating their facility to be applied in real cases. In particular, this paper proposes an implementation for an Energy Management System (EMS) in microgrids using the Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm. Moreover, it compares the proposed algorithm with the Deep Q-Network (DQN). This comparison evaluates the improvement over exploiting the continuous nature of the decision variables against a discretization of the same since the DQN cannot make actions over a continuous space.

AB Due to the complexity of social relationships, Internet users are active in multiple social networks and receive or release information in various ways and channels. Therefore, the spread of public opinion is not limited to a closed single network. Considering the structural characteristics of WeChat, Weibo and Tiktok, we built a multi-layer network based on the complex network theory. Based on the environmental and personal factors, the calculation methods of transmission rate and immunity rate is proposed. The trends of information transmission in the multi-layer network is simulated through an improved SEIR model. Through simulation, the differences of information transmission between multi-layer networks and single-layer networks are explored, and the impacts of network structure, coupling strength between layers and interlayer connection mode on information transmission are studied. More than 76,000 tweets from 7 events on Weibo are collected to verify the effectiveness of the model and explore the dissemination trends of actual public opinions. Through the research, it is found that (1) the public opinion transmission efficiency of multi-layer network is higher, the scale is larger, and the time is longer. (2) Compared with Weibo and Tiktok, the information transmission in WeChat is more efficient and lasts longer, and promotes the information transmission in the other two networks. (3) With the increase of coupling strength between layers, the efficiency of information transmission becomes higher and the scale becomes larger. This study provides new ideas for the research of public opinion dissemination, and helps relevant departments to correctly guide public opinion.

AB Epilepsy as the most common neurological disorder globally has drawn more and more attention. However, it is time-consuming and labor-intensive for manual detection of interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs). Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and automated detection approach as a more accurate diagnostic alternative for epilepsy detection. Recently, fuzzy broad learning system (FBLS) has been recognized as an alternative to deep learning and utilized in various fields. Nevertheless, FBLS ignores the locally invariant property of data. To effectively address this issue and further improve the performance of FBLS, a novel graph regularized fuzzy broad learning system (GFBLS) is first proposed based on graph regularization. Moreover, an automated GFBLS-based approach is proposed for IEDs detection from EEG recordings. In the proposed method, graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) is firstly utilized to extract features from line graphs with undirected connections, which are constructed by EEG recordings, then extracted features by GCN are fed into GFBLS for IEDs detection. The experimental results demonstrated that GFBLS can achieve accuracy of 92.20%, specificity of 90.90% and precision of 91.13% with the training time of only 31.6 s, which is superior or comparable performance compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB This paper proposes a novel integrated model based on multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method to assess and rank the feeder sections to optimally locate fault indicators in a large-scale distribution network. First, decision makers' weights are computed based on the subjective weighting information. Then, dataset including data calculated for every alternative under active power flow, failure rate, repair time, number of customers, and customer type criteria are grouped using mixed-type clustering algorithm. This leads to the number of clusters extracted from the dataset, then obtained number of clusters are utilized to set the required linguistic terms. Finally, the ranking order of alternative is assessed by using the fuzzy similarity measure-based technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The newly proposed model combines the merits of integrated enhanced particle swarm optimization (EPSO) fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model in dealing with fuzziness and vagueness of linguistic assessments, the merits of clustering algorithm focused on representing performance values of each alternative with respect to each decision criterion and the merits of similarity measure-based TOPSIS in solving complex decision-making problems. The proposed model is applied to the RBTS4 and then sensitivity analysis is performed in the optimal solution.

AB Most robot manipulators usually operate under different nonlinearities, such as state constraints, time delays, and actuator input saturation faults. This paper proposes an adaptive finite-time fault-tolerant controller for the full-state-constrained robotic manipulator with novel prescribed performance and time-varying delays. Firstly, a novel prescribed performance function consisting of hyperbolic tangent and hyperbolic cotangent functions is constructed to the full-state performance constraints of the robotic manipulator. Such a design can circumvent the demands for accurate initial conditions of the state variables and guarantee the convergence of the state errors in a prescribed time. Then, based on the finite-time principle, a finite-time command filter and a compensation mechanism with fractional-power terms are used to bypass the "explosion of complexity"and further compensate for the filter errors within a finite time. Moreover, a proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is devised within the controller design to compensate for the time-varying delays. And the radial basis function neural networks are used to estimate the other nonlinearities including actuator saturation faults, and external perturbations. Finally, simulation results exhibit that the controller designed in this paper has a faster convergence speed and minor state errors.

AB For the sustainability of the environment, minimization of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the production of cement and resolving the issues related to the dumping of construction and demolition waste have become the most important measures. Furthermore, deep learning and numerical models have been required for the accurate predictions of the axial structural efficiency of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforced geopolymeric recycled aggregate concrete (GRC) columns with synthetic fibers (GGRC columns). The present study investigated the behavior of novel GGRC columns under concentric and eccentric loads. A set of 9 circular spirals confined concrete columns (300 mm x 1200 mm) was produced. A new threedimensional (3-D) finite element model (FEM) for capturing the mechanical efficacy of GGRC columns was put forward. A parametric study was carried out using the projected FEM to examine the impact of reinforcement of longitudinal FRP rebars (pl), compression stress of concrete (fro), the diameter of GGRC columns (D), Young's modulus of FRP rebars (Ef), the height of GGRC members (H), and the ultimate tensile stress of FRP rebars (fy). The results indicated that the GGRC members presented better structural efficiency in terms of axial stress and ductility under concentric and eccentric loads. The increment in axial stress for GGRC concentric members was noticed to be 9% at a reduction of spiral spacing from 100 mm to 50 mm. The suggested FEM portrayed 1.66% and 9.13% divergence of results for axial stress and relative axial strain of the samples, correspondingly. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was projected using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) based on the previous experimental database for predicting the stress of GGRC members. The advised GMDH model performed well over the dataset by involving the axial contribution of GFRP bars and the confinement efficiency of spirals and reported the highest accuracy with MAE = 195.67, RMSE = 255.41, and R2 = 0.94 as compared with the previous models.

AB Deep neural networks have shown their promise in recent years with their state-of-the-art results. Yet, backpropagation-based methods may suffer from time-consuming training process and catastrophic forgetting when performing online learning. In this work we attempt to curtail them by employing the ensemble deep Random Vector Functional Link (edRVFL). As opposed to backpropagation-based neural networks that adjust weights iteratively, RVFL uses a closed-form solution method without iterative parameter learning. In addition, our approach allows the model to grow incrementally as new data is made available so that it can more resemble real-life learning scenarios. Our proposed online learning models were able to perform better on 72% of the datasets in the classification scenario and 80% of the datasets in the regression scenario, when compared to other available randomization-based online learning models in the literature. This is further supported by statistical comparisons which also show the stability of our network.

AB This paper studies the distributed permutation flowshop group scheduling problem (DPFGSP) with the consideration of minimizing total flowtime (TF), which has important applications in the modern manufac-turing process. Based on the characteristics of the problem, a cooperative population-based iterated greedy (CPIG) algorithm is proposed by combining the advantages of the divide-and-rule policy, population-based evolution and iterated greedy algorithm. The CPIG divides the DPFGSP into two coupled sub-problems of group scheduling sub-problem and job scheduling sub-problem, and starts with a single population for simplicity. Unlike in the traditional cooperative co-evolutionary algorithms, the two-coupled sub-problems are addressed with a certain probability that can be determined in favor of solving the whole scheduling problem. Some advanced technologies are used, including the constructive heuristics based initialization, the critical factories based destruction and construction, the new best solution based population updating mechanism. The comprehensive experimental evaluation of 810 instances shows that the CPIG algorithm performs much better than the five state-of-the-art metaheuristics in the literature which are closely related to the considered scheduling problem.

AB Logic reasoning involving big data often requires the proper handling of data veracity. Indeed with data that cannot be trusted to the same extent, users should at least be aware on the trust they can have in the obtained reasoning. In this paper, we propose a novel logic framework that is based on so-called L-grades. L-grades are a special case of Zadeh's Z-numbers, consisting of a pair (s, c) & ISIN; [0, 1]2 in which s is a suitability grade (or satisfaction grade) and c is a confidence grade denoting how confident we can be on s. Both grades are further processed using fuzzy logic. A novel negation operator and novel conjunction and disjunction operators satisfying commutativity, associativity, but not distributivity properties are proposed. Furthermore, so-called sibling aggregators for L-grades are introduced and studied. With this framework we aim to contribute to explainable computational intelligence. The practical applicability of L-grades is discussed based on the demand for more informative, explainable results in the TILES decision support system for sand extraction from the North Sea seabed.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB 3D human pose estimation is a key component of clinical monitoring systems. The clinical applicability of deep pose estimation models, however, is limited by their poor generalization under domain shifts along with their need for sufficient labeled training data. As a remedy, we present a novel domain adaptation method, adapting a model from a labeled source to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Our method comprises two complementary adaptation strategies based on prior knowledge about human anatomy. First, we guide the learning process in the target domain by constraining predictions to the space of anatomically plausible poses. To this end, we embed the prior knowledge into an anatomical loss function that penalizes asymmetric limb lengths, implausible bone lengths, and implausible joint angles. Second, we propose to filter pseudo labels for self-training according to their anatomical plausibility and incorporate the concept into the Mean Teacher paradigm. We unify both strategies in a point cloud-based framework applicable to unsupervised and source free domain adaptation. Evaluation is performed for in-bed pose estimation under two adaptation scenarios, using the public SLP dataset and a newly created dataset. Our method consistently outperforms various stateof-the-art domain adaptation methods, surpasses the baseline model by 31%/66%, and reduces the domain gap by 65%/82%.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The fuzzy clustering C-means (FCM) algorithm is a compelling image segmentation method in image segmen-tation. However, the algorithm is less robust for images containing noise. This paper proposes a non-local full-parameter adaptive spatial information combined with a local fuzzy factor for noisy image segmentation. Firstly, we realize the adaptive calculation of the smoothing parameter, search term window, and neighborhood window in the non-local spatial information by defining the smoothness and designing the adaptive matching function. Secondly, the image's non-local and local spatial information is considered comprehensively to reduce noise interference and segmentation ambiguity. Finally, the weighted average membership linking is used as the denominator of the objective function to reduce the number of iterations. The results in synthetic noise image and color image segmentation experiments show that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance in various evaluation metrics and visual effects, outperforming most other variants of fuzzy clustering-based algorithms.

AB Unemployment constitutes one of the major problems in developing countries, with factors such as unavailable skills and the proliferation of unskilled workers being cited as main causes. The existing literature has shown that using social networks analysis techniques, employment options for students and graduates can be accurately generated through recommender systems (RS) to optimize the chances of employment. Therefore, this study proposes a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model named Contextual BERT (CoBERT) for item-centered content-based (CB) filtering RS. The model uses socio-political background, graduate-employer relationship and graduate academic competencies of information technology (IT) students as contextual factors to recommend employability profiles of IT students in unstable developing countries (UDCs) such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The performance of the proposed model is verified using four metrics. To evaluate the online performance of the model, the metrics of Diversity and Novelty are used. The metrics of normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) and mean average precision (MAP) are applied to evaluate the model offline. The proposed model shows a high nDCG value at Top-N=4, equaling to 0.99. Validation statistics of 0.5 MAP score and significant t-statistics test values for Diversity and Novelty indicate that the proposed model can be generalized in the DRC and other similar UDCs. The RS model proposed in the current study contributes to the literature on employability models by advancing beyond traditional approaches such as fuzzy logic (FL), and also by taking graduate skills into account. The proposed model is a novel employability recommendation technique that provides highly precise and contextual recommendations. The output from this study contributes a theoretical foundation for implementing RSs in education and the industry.

AB Recent studies show that multi-modal data fusion techniques combining information from diverse sources are helpful to diagnose and predict complex brain disorders. However, most existing diagnosis methods have only simply employed a feature combination strategy for multiple imaging and genetic data, ignoring the imaging phenotypes associated with the risk gene information. To this end, we present a hypergraph-regularized multimodal learning by graph diffusion (HMGD) for joint association learning and outcome prediction. Specifically, we first present a graph diffusion method for enhancing similarity measures among subjects given from multi-modality phenotypes, which fully uses multiple input similarity graphs and integrates them into a unified graph with valuable geometric structures among different imaging phenotypes. Then, we employ the unified graph to represent the high-order similarity relationships among subjects, and enforce a hypergraph-regularized term to incorporate both inter-and cross-modality information for selecting the imaging phenotypes associated with the risk single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Finally, a multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) is adopted to fuse such phenotypic features selected from different modalities for the final diagnosis and prediction. The proposed approach is experimentally explored on brain imaging genetic data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets. Relevant results present that the proposed approach is superior to several competing algorithms, and realizes strong associations and discovers significant consistent and robust ROIs across different imaging phenotypes associated with the genetic risk biomarkers to guide disease interpretation and prediction.

AB Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS) algorithms benefit from the non-convex optimization capability of evolutionary computation. However, most ENAS algorithms use a genetic algorithm (GA) with fixed parameter settings, which limits the algorithm's search performance. Furthermore, the information generated during the evolutionary process is often ignored, while this information can be helpful for guiding the evolutionary direction of the population. This paper proposes a novel ENAS algorithm based on adaptive parameter control and gene potential contribution (AG-ENAS) to evolve neural networks efficiently. Firstly, an adaptive parameter adjustment mechanism is designed, based on population diversity and fitness. This enables better-informed adaptation of related parameters of genetic operators. Secondly, the mutation operator guided by the gene potential contribution of genes tends to produce better offspring. The gene potential contribution reflects the positive effect of the current gene on fitness. It guides the evolution by weighting the more valuable genes with the distribution index matrix. Finally, the concept of aging is introduced into the environmental selection, to offer more opportunities to the young generation and alleviate premature convergence. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on eight different datasets, and compared against 44 state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The experimental results show that the network designed by AG-ENAS obtains higher classification accuracy than manual-designed networks such as SENet, DenseNet, and other ENAS algorithms such as Large-Evo and AE-CNN.

AB Constrained many-objective optimization problems (CMaOPs) are frequently encountered in real-world ap-plications, generally having constrained Pareto fronts (PFs) that are often incomplete and irregular in high-dimensional objective space. Due to the advantage of reference point-based decomposition algorithms on unconstrained many-objective optimization, they have been widely applied into dealing with CMaOPs. However, these algorithms may not be well suited for solving the constrained problems with irregular PFs, since their adopted uniformly distributed reference points may not properly fit the distribution of feasible regions. To address this issue, we propose a constrained many-objective evolutionary algorithm with reference point adaptation. To be specific, the learning vector quantization network is used to collect the feasibility information during the evolutionary search process in the supervised manner. By regarding the feasible and infeasible solutions as two classes of training samples, the network can gradually model the topological structure of the PF and adaptively generate the reference points in the feasible regions. In order to make full use of infeasible solutions to assist in the modeling of the PF, an adaptive e-truncation based constraint-handling technique is proposed to introduce the elite infeasible solutions during the evolutionary process. Experimental results on several public constrained many-objective optimization test suites demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with seven state of-the-art algorithms.

AB Communication in multi-agent systems is a key driver of team-level cooperation, for instance allowing individual agents to augment their knowledge about the world in partially-observable environments. In this paper, we propose two reinforcement learning-based multi-agent models, namely FCMNet and FCMTran. The two models both allow agents to simultaneously learn a differentiable communication mechanism that connects all agents as well as a common, cooperative policy conditioned upon received information. FCMNet utilizes multiple directional Long Short-Term Memory chains to sequentially transmit and encode the current observation-based messages sent by every other agent at each timestep. FCMTran further relies on the encoder of a modified transformer to simultaneously aggregate multiple self-generated messages sent by all agents at the previous timestep into a single message that is used in the current timestep. Results from evaluating our models on a challenging set of StarCraft II micromanagement tasks with shared rewards show that FCMNet and FCMTran both outperform recent communication-based methods and value decomposition methods in almost all tested StarCraft II micromanagement tasks. We further improve the performance of our models by combining them with value decomposition techniques; there, in particular, we show that FCMTran with value decomposition significantly pushes the state-of-the-art on one of the hardest benchmark tasks without any task-specific tuning. We also investigate the robustness of FCMNet under communication disturbances (i.e., binarized messages, random message loss, and random communication order) in an asymmetric collaborative pathfinding task with individual rewards, demonstrating FMCNet's potential applicability in real-world robotic tasks.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown tremendous success in the detection of objects and vehicles in recent years. However, when using CNNs to identify real-time vehicle detection in a moving context remains difficult. Many obscured and truncated cars, as well as huge vehicle scale fluctuations in traffic photos, provide these issues. To improve the performance of detection findings, we used multiscale feature maps from CNN or input pictures with numerous resolutions to adapt the base network to match different scales. This research presents an enhanced framework depending on Faster R-CNN for rapid vehicle recognition which presents better accuracy and fast processing time. Research results on our custom dataset indicate that our recommended methodology performed better in terms of detection efficiency and processing time, especially in comparison to the earlier age of Faster R-CNN models.

AB In recent years, personal authentication based on attitude estimation-gait recognition authentication has become a popular research topic because of its long-range, non-invasive, non-contact, high-precision, and other advantages. However, at present, most relevant research prefers to use the acquired original data directly for iteration and learning. As a result, it takes too long to learn relevant models in the use scenarios with complicated data and heavy human traffic, such as airports and railway stations, where real-time identification cannot be completed while maintaining accuracy, and thus a scheme to improve the learning and recognition speed is needed. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed an innovative real-time MediaPipe-based gait analysis framework and a new Composite Filter Feature Selection (CFFS) method via key nodes, angles, and lengths calculating. Then, based on the proposed method, we extract the aimed features as a new dataset and verified it by 1D-CNN neural network. Furthermore, we also applied Hilbert-Huang transform to investigate these extracted gait features in the frequency domain, improving the performance of our proposed framework to achieve real time under higher recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that the innovative gait recognition framework and data processing technology can reduce the gait feature data, speed up the process of gait recognition, and still maintain the original recognition accuracy.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based tracking has shown large potential in various domains such as transportation, logistics, public safety, and more. However, deploying deep learning (DL)-based tracking algorithms on UAVs is challenging because of limitations in computing resources, battery capacity, and maximum load. Discriminative correlation filter (DCF)-based trackers have become a popular choice in the UAV tracking community owing to their ability to provide superior efficiency while consuming fewer resources. However, the limited representation learning ability of DCF-based trackers leads to lower precision in complex scenarios compared to DL-based methods. Filter pruning is a prevalent practice for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with constrained resources, and it may be an effective way to solve problems encountered when deploying deep learning trackers on UAVs. However, the application of filter pruning to UAV tracking is underexplored, and a straightforward and useful pruning standard is desirable. This paper proposes using Fisher pruning to reduce the SiamFC++ model for UAV tracking, resulting in the F-SiamFC++ tracker. The proposed tracker achieves a remarkable balance between precision and efficiency, as demonstrated through exhaustive experiments on four popular UAV benchmarks: UAVDT, DTB70, UAV123@10fps, and Vistrone2018, showing state-of-the-art performance.

AB We present a deep-learning based tracking objects of interest in walking droplet and granular intruder experiments. In a typical walking droplet experiment, a liquid droplet, known as walker, propels itself laterally on the free surface of a vibrating bath of the same liquid. This lateral motion stems from the interaction between the droplet and the wave it generates upon successive bounces off the vibrating liquid surface. A walker can exhibit a highly irregular trajectory over the course of its motion, including rapid acceleration and complex interactions with the other walkers present in the bath. In analogy with the hydrodynamic experiments, the granular matter experiments consist of a vibrating bath of very small solid particles and a larger solid called intruder. Like the fluid droplets, the intruder interacts with and travels the domain due to the waves of the bath but tends to move much slower and much less smoothly than the droplets. When multiple intruders are introduced, they also exhibit complex interactions with each other. We leverage the state-of-the-art object detection model YOLO (You Only Look Once) and the Hungarian Algorithm to accurately extract the trajectory of a walker or intruder in real-time. Our proposed methodology is capable of tracking individual walker(s) or intruder(s) in digital images acquired from a broad spectrum of experimental settings and does not suffer from any identity-switch issues. Thus, the deep learning approach developed in this work could be used to automatize the efficient, fast and accurate extraction of observables of interests in walking droplet, granular intruder experiments and similar particle tracking experiments. Such extraction capabilities are critically enabling for downstream tasks such as building data-driven dynamical models for the coarse-grained dynamics and interactions of the objects of interest.

ID VERSATILE
AB When the existing visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) algorithms are applied to dynamic environments, the pose error estimated by the system often increases sharply, or even the algorithm fails due to the interference of dynamic objects. To adapt to dynamic scenes, a dynamic object processing part needs to be added to the system. However, some existing processing methods lead to reduced real-time performance, which is not conducive to the real-time localization and navigation of mobile robots. To solve the above problems, an RGB-D SLAM system is proposed in this paper for indoor dynamic environments. The system designs an adaptive semantic segmentation tracking algorithm to meet the requirements of localization accuracy and real-time performance in dynamic scenes. First, a lightweight semantic segmentation network is used to provide a priori information about the object. According to this prior information and the motion state of the object in the previous scene, each feature point is assigned a motion level and is classified as a static point, movable static point, or dynamic point. Then, whether the current frame needs semantic segmentation is adaptively determined according to the motion level information of the feature points. Some appropriate feature points (static points) are selected for initial pose estimation, and then, secondary optimization of the pose is performed according to the results of weighted static constraints. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out on the TUM RGB-D dynamic scene dataset and compared with ORB-SLAM2 and other SLAM algorithms for dynamic environments. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs well on most datasets, and the positioning accuracy in indoor dynamic environments can be improved by 90.57% compared with the ORB-SLAM2 algorithm. In addition, a 3D semantic map of static backgrounds in dynamic scenes has been established, using dense point cloud maps to visualize 3D scene information, and incorporating semantic information to label objects in the scene, to guide advanced tasks such as robot navigation and enhance the usability of the system.

AB Multi-task distributed scheduling (MTDS) remains a challenging problem for multi-agent systems used for uncertain and dynamic real-world tasks such as search-and-rescue. The Performance Impact (PI) algorithm is an excellent solution for MTDS, but it suffers from the problem of non-convergence that it may fall into an infinite cycle of exchanging the same task. In this paper, we improve the PI algorithm through the integration of a task removal inference strategy and a deadlock avoidance mechanism. Specifically, the task removal inference strategy results in better exploration performance than the original PI, improving the suboptimal solutions caused by the heuristics for local task selection as done in PI. In addition, we design a deadlock avoidance mechanism that limits the number of times of removing the same task and isolating consecutive inclusions of the same task. Therefore, it guarantees the convergence of the MTDS algorithm. We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm over the original PI algorithm through Monte Carlo simulation of the search-and-rescue task. The results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain a lower average time cost and the highest total allocation number.

AB Non-convergence is an inherent aspect of adaptive multi-agent systems, and even basic learning models, such as the replicator dynamics, are not guaranteed to equilibriate. Limit cycles, and even more complicated chaotic sets are in fact possible even in rather simple games, including variants of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. A key challenge of multi-agent learning theory lies in characterization of these limit sets, based on qualitative features of the underlying game. Although chaotic behavior in learning dynamics can be precluded by the celebrated Poincare-Bendixson theorem, it is only applicable directly to low-dimensional settings. In this work, we attempt to find other characteristics of a game that can force regularity in the limit sets of learning. We show that behavior consistent with the Poincare-Bendixson theorem (limit cycles, but no chaotic attractor) follows purely from the topological structure of interactions, even for high-dimensional settings with an arbitrary number of players, and arbitrary payoff matrices. We prove our result for a wide class of follow-the-regularized leader (FoReL) dynamics, which generalize replicator dynamics, for binary games characterized interaction graphs where the payoffs of each player are only affected by one other player (i.e., interaction graphs of indegree one). Moreover, for cyclic games we provide further insight into the planar structure of limit sets, and in particular limit cycles. We propose simple conditions under which learning comes with efficiency guarantees, implying that FoReL learning achieves time-averaged sum of payoffs at least as good as that of a Nash equilibrium, thereby connecting the topology of the dynamics to social-welfare analysis.

It is known that these problems are computationally hard. Although they have been studied from the parameterized complexity point of view with respect to several natural parameters, many of them turned out to be W[1]-hard or W[2]-hard. Aiming at obtaining plentiful fixed-parameter algorithms, we revisit these problems by considering more natural single parameters, combined parameters, and structural parameters.

AB Bridging intelligent symbolic agents and sub-symbolic predictors is a long-standing research goal in AI. Among the recent integration efforts, symbolic knowledge injection (SKI) proposes algorithms aimed at steering sub-symbolic predictors' learning towards compliance w.r.t. pre-existing symbolic knowledge bases. However, state-of-the-art contributions about SKI mostly tackle injection from a foundational perspective, often focussing solely on improving the predictive performance of the sub-symbolic predictors undergoing injection. Technical contributions, in turn, are tailored on individual methods/experiments and therefore poorly interoperable with agent technologies as well as among each others. Intelligent agents may exploit SKI to serve many purposes other than predictive performance alone-provided that, of course, adequate technological support exists: for instance, SKI may allow agents to tune computational, energetic, or data requirements of sub-symbolic predictors. Given that different algorithms may exist to serve all those many purposes, some criteria for algorithm selection as well as a suitable technology should be available to let agents dynamically select and exploit the most suitable algorithm for the problem at hand. Along this line, in this work we design a set of quality-of-service (QoS) metrics for SKI, and a general-purpose software API to enable their application to various SKI algorithms-namely, platform for symbolic knowledge injection (PSyKI). We provide an abstract formulation of four QoS metrics for SKI, and describe the design of PSyKI according to a software engineering perspective. Then we discuss how our QoS metrics are supported by PSyKI. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both our QoS metrics and PSyKI via a number of experiments, where SKI is both applied and assessed via our proposed API. Our empirical analysis demonstrates both the soundness of our proposed metrics and the versatility of PSyKI as the first software tool supporting the application, interchange, and numerical assessment of SKI techniques. To the best of our knowledge, our proposals represent the first attempt to introduce QoS metrics for SKI, and the software tools enabling their practical exploitation for both human and computational agents. In particular, our contributions could be exploited to automate and/or compare the manifold SKI algorithms from the state of the art. Hence moving a concrete step forward the engineering of efficient, robust, and trustworthy software applications that integrate symbolic agents and sub-symbolic predictors.

AB In many risk-aware and multi-objective reinforcement learning settings, the utility of the user is derived from a single execution of a policy. In these settings, making decisions based on the average future returns is not suitable. For example, in a medical setting a patient may only have one opportunity to treat their illness. Making decisions using just the expected future returns-known in reinforcement learning as the value-cannot account for the potential range of adverse or positive outcomes a decision may have. Therefore, we should use the distribution over expected future returns differently to represent the critical information that the agent requires at decision time by taking both the future and accrued returns into consideration. In this paper, we propose two novel Monte Carlo tree search algorithms. Firstly, we present a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that can compute policies for nonlinear utility functions (NLU-MCTS) by optimising the utility of the different possible returns attainable from individual policy executions, resulting in good policies for both risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Secondly, we propose a distributional Monte Carlo tree search algorithm (DMCTS) which extends NLU-MCTS. DMCTS computes an approximate posterior distribution over the utility of the returns, and utilises Thompson sampling during planning to compute policies in risk-aware and multi-objective settings. Both algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art in multi-objective reinforcement learning for the expected utility of the returns.

AB Support agents that help users in their daily lives need to take into account not only the user's characteristics, but also the social situation of the user. Existing work on including social context uses some type of situation cue as an input to information processing techniques in order to assess the expected behavior of the user. However, research shows that it is important to also determine the meaning of a situation, a step which we refer to as social situation comprehension. We propose using psychological characteristics of situations, which have been proposed in social science for ascribing meaning to situations, as the basis for social situation comprehension. Using data from user studies, we evaluate this proposal from two perspectives. First, from a technical perspective, we show that psychological characteristics of situations can be used as input to predict the priority of social situations, and that psychological characteristics of situations can be predicted from the features of a social situation. Second, we investigate the role of the comprehension step in human-machine meaning making. We show that psychological characteristics can be successfully used as a basis for explanations given to users about the decisions of an agenda management personal assistant agent.

AB We propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning algorithm that successfully learns the optimal policy even for non-linear utility functions. Non-linear utility functions pose a challenge for SOTA approaches, both in terms of learning efficiency as well as the solution concept. A key insight is that, by proposing a critic that learns a multi-variate distribution over the returns, which is then combined with accumulated rewards, we can directly optimize on the utility function, even if it is non-linear. This allows us to vastly increase the range of problems that can be solved compared to those which can be handled by single-objective methods or multi-objective methods requiring linear utility functions, yet avoiding the need to learn the full Pareto front. We demonstrate our method on multiple multi-objective benchmarks, and show that it learns effectively where baseline approaches fail.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB Typically, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm focuses in learning a single deployable policy as the end product. Depending on the initialization methods and seed randomization, learning a single policy could possibly leads to convergence to different local optima across different runs, especially when the algorithm is sensitive to hyper-parameter tuning. Motivated by the capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in learning complex data manifold, the adversarial training procedure could be utilized to learn a population of good-performing policies instead. We extend the teacher-student methodology observed in the Knowledge Distillation field in typical deep neural network prediction tasks to RL paradigm. Instead of learning a single compressed student network, an adversarially-trained generative model (hypernetwork) is learned to output network weights of a population of good-performing policy networks, representing a school of apprentices. Our proposed framework, named Teacher-Apprentices RL (TARL), is modular and could be used in conjunction with many existing RL algorithms. We illustrate the performance gain and improved robustness by combining TARL with various types of RL algorithms, including direct policy search Cross-Entropy Method, Q-learning, Actor-Critic, and policy gradient-based methods.

AB In one of its simplest forms, Team Formation involves deploying the least expensive team of agents while covering a set of skills. While current algorithms are reasonably successful in computing the best teams, the resilience to change of such solutions remains an important concern: Once a team has been formed, some of the agents considered at start may be finally defective and some skills may become uncovered. Two recently introduced solution concepts deal with this issue proactively: 1) form a team which is robust to changes so that after some agent losses, all skills remain covered, and 2) opt for a recoverable team, i.e., it can be "repaired" in the worst case by hiring new agents while keeping the overall deployment cost minimal. In this paper, we introduce the problem of partially robust team formation (PR-TF). Partial robustness is a weaker form of robustness which guarantees a certain degree of skill coverage after some agents are lost. We analyze the computational complexity of PR-TF and provide two complete algorithms for it. We compare the performance of our algorithms with the existing methods for robust and recoverable team formation on several existing and newly introduced benchmarks. Our empirical study demonstrates that partial robustness offers an interesting trade-off between (full) robustness and recoverability in terms of computational efficiency, skill coverage guaranteed after agent losses and repairability. This paper is an extended and revised version of as reported by (Schwind et al., Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS'21), pp. 1154-1162, 2021).

AB To satisfy the requirements of individual design and rapid performance evaluation of complex products, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to build a performance evaluation model and perform the rapid evaluation of design schemes. This approach consists of a surrogate model and knowledge graph (KG). Firstly, the KG of complex electromechanical products is established by Web Ontology Language to provide information about parts and evaluation indexes for the sampling process. It includes building ontology and writing inference and query rules at the framework level. Secondly, based on the sample points, a dynamics model is built and used for simulation. Using the Design of Experiments, the variables that have the greatest impact are found. The relevant variables will be input into the model to obtain the data set. According to the data set, a surrogate model based on the radial basis function is built as a performance evaluation model, which can improve computing efficiency to achieve evaluation results rapidly. In this study, the bogie design is used as a test case to evaluate the proposed method. And the results show that it can improve design efficiency for design issues such as part selection.

DT Article; Early Access
DE 2D pose estimation; Graph convolutional networks; Dual GCN; Adaptive
   adjacency matrix
AB Pose estimation in crowded scenes is key to understanding human behavior in real-life applications. Most existing CNN-based pose estimation methods often depend on the appearance of visible parts as cues to localize human joints. However, occlusion is typical in crowded scenes, and invisible body parts have no valid features for joint localization. Introducing prior information about the human pose structure to infer the locations of occluded parts is a natural solution to this problem. In this paper, we argue that learning structural information based on human joints alone is not enough to address human body variations and could be prone to overfitting. From a perspective on the human pose as a dual representation of joints and limbs, we propose a pose refinement network, coined as dual graph network (DGN), to jointly learn its structural information of body joints and limbs by incorporating the cooperative constraints between two branches. Specifically, our DGN has two coupled graph convolutional network (GCN) branches to model the structure information of joints and limbs. Each stage in the branch is composed of a feature aggregator and a GCN module for inter-branch information fusion and intra-branch context extraction, respectively. In addition, to enhance the modeling capacity of GCN, we design an adaptive GCN layer (AGL) embedded in the GCN module to handle each pose instance based on its graph structure. We also propose a heatmap-guided sampling to leverage the features of the body parts to provide rich visual features for the inference of occluded parts. We perform extensive experiments on five challenging datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGN on pose estimation. Our DGN obtains significant performance improvement from 67.9 to 72.4 mAP in the CrowdPose dataset with the same CNN-based pose estimator and training strategy as the OPEC-Net. It shows that, compared to the OPEC-Net only considering joints, our DGN has a clear advantage due to the joint consideration of both joints and limbs. Meanwhile, our DGN is also helpful for pose estimation in general datasets (i.e., COCO and Pose track) with less occlusion and mutual interference, demonstrating the generalization power of DGN on refining human poses.

AB In recent years, significant achievements have been made in time series forecasting using deep learning methods, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). However, time series often exhibit complex patterns and relationships like trends, seasonal patterns and irregularities, and LSTM networks fail to effectively strengthen long-term dependence in time series data, which may lead to inaccurate forecasting effect or performance degradation. Therefore, building a model to explore the temporal dependence within the time series data completely still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Implicit Memory Gaussian (DIMG) Network based on bidirectional deep memory kernel process and the implicit features enhancement method for time series forecasting. We first use the implicit features enhancement method to obtain the hidden features of the data according to the nonlinear mapping characteristics of encoder. Then, a new deep learning process called bidirectional deep memory kernel has been developed, which merges the structural properties of deep learning with the adaptability of kernel methods to capture intricate information and memory structures in sequential data. This process fully encapsulates the structure of Bi-LSTM and Gaussian process regression (GPR). Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results verify that our model outperforms other reported methods in terms of prediction accuracy.

ID ACTION RECOGNITION
AB Sports videos are widely used by athletes and coaches for training and match analysis purposes outside the mainstream audience. Sports videos should be effectively classified into different genres to easily retrieve and index them from large video datasets. Manual labelling classification methods may cause errors and have low accuracy. Classification based on video content analysis is challenging for computer vision-based techniques. This work introduces an improved focus-net deep learning (DL) model called the Convolutional squeeze U-Net based encoder-decoder for sports video retrieval and classification. First, the keyframes are extracted from the input sports video using a clustering and optical flow analysis method. In the next stage, the frames are preprocessed using a smoothed shock filtering technique to remove the noise. The process of image segmentation is carried out using a Convolutional squeeze U-Net based encoder-decoder model. Finally, the sports video can be classified using the softmax classifier. A CNN (convolutional neural network) is utilized at the encoder section for extracting the features and fed to the decoder for video classification. The experiments are performed in the UCF101 dataset, and the proposed model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.68%. Hence, it is proven that the proposed focus-net model can be efficiently utilized in sports video classification.

AB Due to its efficient model calibration given by unique incremental learning capability, broad learning system (BLS) has made impressive progress in image analytical tasks such as image classification and object detection. Inspired by this incremental remodel success, we proposed a novel transformer-BLS network to achieve a trade-off between model training speed and accuracy. Specially, we developed sub-BLS layers with the multi-head attention mechanism and combining these layers to construct a transformer-BLS network. In particular, our proposed transformer-BLS network provides four different incremental learning algorithms that enable the proposed model can realize the increments of its feature nodes, enhancement nodes, input data and sub-BLS layers, respectively, without the need of the full-weight update in this model. Furthermore, we validated the performance of our transformer-BLS network and its four incremental learning algorithms on a variety of image classification datasets. The results demonstrated that the proposed transformer-BLS maintains classification performance on both the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, while saving 2/3 of the training time. These findings imply that the proposed method has the potential in significant reducing model training complexity with this incremental remodel system, while simultaneously improving the increment learning performance of the original BLS within such contexts, especially in the classification task of some datasets.

AB Recently, the significance of accurate aircraft delay forecasting has grown in the aviation sector, which caused multi-billion-dollar losses faced by airlines and airports and passenger loyalty losses. Due to the importance of accurate flight delay prediction for all stakeholders involved, the aviation sector seeks to develop techniques for more robust flight delay prediction. Is quickly becoming an important research issue to improve airport and airline service performance and offer customers dependable travel itineraries. Machine learning techniques have been used in a number of studies to evaluate and resolve issues with flight delay prediction. This paper proposes a framework integrated network called 'Attention-based Bidirectional long short-term memory' (ATT-BI-LSTM) for flight delay prediction. The Bidirectional LSTM model extracts the spatial and temporal of the flight network with weather features. The 'Attention mechanism' has been proposed to enable the model to discover significant and discriminating features that contribute to categorization. The first stage of the proposed framework is the 'preprocessing of dataset' which is performed through two steps. The first step is data transformation using MinMax scaler to reduce the variation in the data. The second step is 'balancing the dataset' using SMOTE technique for balancing data. The second stage is the establishment of the ATT-BI-LSTM network through the deep tuning experiments of network structure to identify the best combination of parameters and network architecture. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, a wide network of US domestic flights tested in two scenarios. In Scenario 1, the objective is to predict the delay of flight arrival and departure, by using basic flight features with the weather. In Scenario 2, the objective is to predict the delay of flight arrival, by using basic flight features with departure delays. Simulation results show that in scenario 1, the training accuracy of flights' delay is 88% in both flight delay arrivals and departure, and the testing accuracies of flights' delay 83% and 82% in departure and arrival respectively. On the other hand, in scenario 2, testing accuracies are 94.30% and 93.71% in the two datasets respectively. The simulation results show that the ATT-BI-LSTM model outperforms other models found in the literature. Therefore, the developed ATT-BI-LSTM framework can contribute strongly to mitigating flight delays by providing a high accuracy prediction system in real-time monitoring to airport and aviation authorities.

AB The Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) is a swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm that simulates the intelligent foraging behaviors of crows. While CSA effectively handles global optimization problems, it suffers from certain limitations, such as low search accuracy and a tendency to converge to local optima. To address these shortcomings, researchers have proposed modifications and enhancements to CSA's search mechanism. One widely explored approach is the structured population mechanism, which maintains diversity during the search process to mitigate premature convergence. The island model, a common structured population method, divides the population into smaller independent sub-populations called islands, each running in parallel. Migration, the primary technique for promoting population diversity, facilitates the exchange of relevant and useful information between islands during iterations. This paper introduces an enhanced variant of CSA, called Enhanced CSA (ECSA), which incorporates the cooperative island model (iECSA) to improve its search capabilities and avoid premature convergence. The proposed iECSA incorporates two enhancements to CSA. Firstly, an adaptive tournament-based selection mechanism is employed to choose the guided solution. Secondly, the basic random movement in CSA is replaced with a modified operator to enhance exploration. The performance of iECSA is evaluated on 53 real-valued mathematical problems, including 23 classical benchmark functions and 30 IEEE-CEC2014 benchmark functions. A sensitivity analysis of key iECSA parameters is conducted to understand their impact on convergence and diversity. The efficacy of iECSA is validated by conducting an extensive evaluation against a comprehensive set of well-established and recently introduced meta-heuristic algorithms, encompassing a total of seventeen different algorithms. Significant differences among these comparative algorithms are established utilizing statistical tests like Wilcoxon's rank-sum and Friedman's tests. Experimental results demonstrate that iECSA outperforms the fundamental ECSA algorithm on 82.6% of standard test functions, providing more accurate and reliable outcomes compared to other CSA variants. Furthermore, Extensive experimentation consistently showcases that the iECSA outperforms its comparable algorithms across a diverse set of benchmark functions.

AB Facial expression recognition in the wild has become more challenging owing to various unconstrained conditions, such as facial occlusion and pose variation. Previous methods usually recognize expressions by holistic or relatively coarse local methods, but only capture limited features and are susceptible to be influenced. In this paper, we propose the Global-local Feature Fusion Transformers (GFFT) that is centered on cross-patch communication between features by self-attentive fusion. This method solves the problems of facial occlusion and pose variation effectively. Firstly, the Global Contextual Information Perception (GCIP) is designed to fuse global and local features, learning the relationship between them. Subsequently, the Facial Salient Feature Perception (FSFP) module is proposed to guide the fusion features to understand the key regions of facial features using facial landmark features to further capture face-related salient features. In addition, the Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) is constructed to combine different stages of fusion features to reduce the sensitivity of the deep network to facial occlusion. Extensive experiments show that our GFFT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with 92.05% on RAF-DB, 67.46% on AffectNet-7, 63.62% on AffectNet-8, and 91.04% on FERPlus, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

AB When solving constrained multiobjective optimization problems (CMOPs), how to maintain diversity without losing convergence is a major challenge, because some small discrete feasible regions make the population hard to find a complete feasible Pareto Front. To this end, an interactive niching-based two-stage evolutionary algorithm for constrained multiobjective optimization, named INCMO, is proposed in this study. At each stage of INCMO, both two populations are employed to focus on different evolution purposes. Specifically, the main population optimizes the original CMOP, while the auxiliary population only considers the objectives by ignoring all constraints. INCMO uses two different niching mechanisms in two stages. In the early stage, each population independently uses the niching technique to generate offspring, to maintain diversity. In addition, two offspring populations are shared to realize migration between two populations. In the later stage, two populations cooperate to generate offspring based on an interactive niching technique. To be specific, two populations are merged and then divided into different niches. In this case, individuals from two populations will be assigned to the same niche. After that, individuals in the niche produce offspring through crossover and mutation. The process of generating offspring also promotes more effective migration between the two populations on the basis of increasing the diversity of population. Compared with other well-established methods, the proposed method in this study shows better performance on four test suites including 47 benchmark problems.

AB Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) optimization for energy consumption reduction is becoming ever more a topic of the utmost environmental and energetic concerns. The two most employed methodologies for optimizing HVAC systems are Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This paper compares three different RL approaches to HVAC optimization: one based on a black-box system identification model trained on historical data, one based on a white-box model of a building and one online method based on an imitation learning pretraining phase on historical data. The three approaches are compared with a literature baseline and an EnergyPlus baseline. Results show that the overall best method in terms of energy consumption reduction (65% decrease) and thermal comfort increase (25% increase) is the approach based on the white-box model. However, the proposed methodology, based on online and imitation learning, demonstrates remarkable efficiency, achieving comparable improvements in energy consumption after just a few months of online training, while maintaining thermal comfort at around the same level as the baseline. These results prove a direct online RL approach, which avoid the use of costly simulations, can provide a reliable and inexpensive solution to the problem of HVAC optimization.

AB In this paper, a new hybrid of lightning search algorithm (LSA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) is proposed in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the conventional multi-objective NSGAII. In the proposed method, the important parameters of the NSGAII are optimized using LSA. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is applied to 19 well-known standard test functions, including unconstrained functions, UF1-UF7, constrained functions, CF1-CF7, Schaffer1, Schaffer2, ZDT1, ZDT2, and ZDT3. The inverted generational distance (IGD) is used to check the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Accordingly, the proposed algorithm is compared with the most used multi-objective algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm is applied to a practical case study of optimal switch, including reclosers and disconnectors, placement in the presence of distributed generation (DG) sources. The distribution networks are the Roy-Billinton test system (RBTS) and a part of the real network in Mazandaran province, in Iran. The simulation results confirm the superiority of the proposed method. For example, in practical case studies, the proposed algorithm for optimal recloser placement in the real network shows 47.09% and 4.691% cost improvement compared with multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and NSGAII, respectively. These improvements for RBTS-BUS2 are 3.725% and 3.502%, respectively. Also, for the RBTS-BUS2, the proposed algorithm result shows 1% and 0.732% reliability improvement compared with MOPSO and NSGAII, respectively.

AB Within the context of Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, Variable Importance in the Projection (VIP) index is extensively used to highlight the relative importance of a given variable in predicting the response. Very often, it is used as a means to select relevant variables by retaining those variables with a VIP value greater than one. As a starting point of this paper, the VIP index is expressed in matrix notation and extended to (i) a subset of variables instead of one variable at a time and (ii) the framework of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In a subsequent stage, it is proposed to assess the significance of the VIP values of a given subset of variables based on a per-mutation test. A fast variable selection procedure is then proposed, taking advantage of the first extension. The theory is illustrated using multiblock spectral and omics data.

AB Guided depth super-resolution aims at using a low-resolution depth map and an associated high-resolution RGB image to recover a high-resolution depth map. However, restoring precise and sharp edges near depth discontinuities and fine structures is still challenging for state-of-the-art methods. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel multi-stage depth super-resolution network, which progressively reconstructs HR depth maps from explicit and implicit high-frequency information. We introduce an efficient transformer to obtain explicit high-frequency information. The shape bias and global context of the transformer allow our model to focus on high-frequency details between objects, i.e., depth discontinuities, rather than texture within objects. Furthermore, we project the input color images into the frequency domain for additional implicit high-frequency cues extraction. Finally, to incorporate the structural details, we develop a fusion strategy that combines depth features and high-frequency information in the multi-stage-scale framework. Exhaustive experiments on the main benchmarks show that our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/wudiqx106/DSR-EI.

ID ALGORITHM
AB As part of the fourth industrial revolution, logistics processes are augmented with connected information systems to improve their reliability and sustainability. Above all, customers can analyse process data obtained from the networked logistics operations to reduce costs and increase margins. The logistics of managing liquid goods is particularly challenging due to the strict transport temperature requirements involving monitoring via sensors attached to containers. However, these sensors transmit much redundant information that, at times, does not provide additional value to the customer, while consuming the limited energy stored in the sensor batteries. This paper aims to explore and study alternative approaches for location tracking and state monitoring in the context of liquid goods logistics. This problem is addressed by using a combination of data-driven sensing and agent-based modelling techniques. The simulation results show that the longest life span of batteries is achieved when most sensors are put into sleep mode yielding an increase of x21.7 and x3.7 for two typical routing scenarios. However, to allow for situations in which high quality sensor data is required to make decisions, agents need to be made aware of the life cycle phase of individual containers. Key contributions include (1) an agent-based approach for modelling the dynamics of liquid goods logistics to enable monitoring and detect inefficiencies (2) the development and analysis of three sensor usage strategies for reducing the energy consumption, and (3) an evaluation of the trade-offs between energy consumption and location tracking precision for timely decision making in resource constrained monitoring systems.

AB Decoupling the physical world and providing standardized service interfaces is still challenging when devel-oping Location Based Services (LBS). This lack also hinders the possibility of developing Intelligent services on top of LBS architectures. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer Digital Twin-based architecture that aims to enable the development of machine learning-based Intelligent LBS (I-LBS) that are able to adapt, evolve, and perform Continual Learning (CL). The platform uses Digital Twins to ensure physical abstraction and provide cyber-physical knowledge to the I-LBSs, which is defined as an execution graph of operation modules. Finally, we simulated a use-case for this platform in the complex scenario of Healthcare organization and management where the I-LBS classifies allowed/not allowed trajectories of users inside a real-existing hospital scenario depending on their role in the organization. The use case is implemented as a Deep Learning-based reconstruction task of high-resolution trajectories processed by the DT architecture that also deploys the I-LBS. The platform is evaluated in terms of physical complexity and computational time on the DT side and on both a traditional machine learning setting and a replay-based CL one for the intelligence side to demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability features introduced by the components for dynamic or unseen scenarios.

AB Over the last decade, videos uploaded and shared through web-based multimedia platforms and mobile applications have proliferated worldwide. This is because cloud-based applications such as iCloud, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp offer affordable and secure environments for video storage and sharing. However, new challenges have emerged alarming forensic analysts and investigators since videos can be used to commit heinous crimes such as blackmail, fraud, and forgery. Source Camera Identification (SCI) has become of paramount importance in the field of image and video forensics. Camera model identification can also help identify the perpetrators or narrow down the search and can be used to enhance SCI systems. In this context, existing approaches such as the Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) based methods and machine learning techniques such as the support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning models are commonly used solutions. This work exploits these two categories of methods by exploring a hierarchical deep learning model for camera model identification based on smartphone videos. The PRNU features are extracted by CNN-based structures during the training process. Proposed six-stream networks are leveraged to extract both low-level and high-level features through the network. A fusion layer is created based on joint sparse representation using forward and backward functions defined for fusing the proposed six streams. The proposed approach has been implemented and evaluated through intensive experiments, and results showed successful camera model identification with a performance at the frame level reaching an average accuracy of 69.9% for the Daxing dataset and 81.6% for the QUFVD dataset.

AB EXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims at improving users' trust in black-boxed models by explaining their predictions. However, XAI techniques produced unreasonable explanations for software defect prediction since expected outputs (e.g., causes of bugs) were not captured by features used to build models. To set aside feature engineering limitations and evaluate whether XAI could adapt to developers, we exploit XAI for code smell prioritization (i.e., predicting criticalities of sub-optimal coding practices and design choices), whose features could capture developers' major expectations. We assess the gap between XAI explanations and developers' expectations in terms of (1) the accuracy of prediction, (2) the coverage of explanations on expectations, and (3) the complexity of explanations. We also narrow the gap by preserving the features related to developers' expectations as much as possible in feature selection. We find that XAI can explain smells with simpler causes in top 3 to 5 features. Complex smells can be explained in around 10 features, which need more expertise to interpret. Selecting features adapting to the developers' expectations improves coverage by 5% to 29%, with almost no negative impact on accuracy and complexity. Results also highlight the need of dividing coarse-grained prediction targets and developing fine-grained feature engineering.

AB The gate assignment is a complicated real-world problem occurring in airports. The present paper studies the gate assignment problem with combinational gates. The problem is multi-objective by nature, concerning four objectives. Among those objectives, the number of passengers allocated to nearby gates is aimed to be maximized. The remaining objectives are targeted to be minimized, i.e., the total passenger walking distance, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the aircraft assigned to remote gates, and the total distance traveled by the shuttle bus. To solve this problem, we formulate an integer programming model. A column generation-based algorithm based on a set-partitioning model is proposed to solve the problem effectively. In addition, the Pareto Local Search algorithm is adopted to obtain non-dominated solutions. Computational experiments show that the effectiveness of our model is verified through tests with instances of different sizes. The column generation -based algorithm can obtain the optimal solution or the approximately optimal solution with a small gap in a reasonable time. The results of the Pareto Local Search algorithm show the interaction between multiple objectives.

AB During the past years, the environmental and safety-based regulations have turned out to be more stringent, requiring more regulations on the ship's operation and condition for achieving most safety standards. Thus, timely, efficient, and accurate maintenance becomes more significant. The appropriate utilization of data can assist the shipping industry in obtaining improved efficiency and operational cost savings, greater safety, better crew rates, improved asset protection, and environmental protection. The most important objective of this study is to build up a novel technique that can synchronize collected data from different sensors on the ship and implement a scalable framework for identifying the early sign patterns of defective behavior in vessel operating conditions. Particularly, the novel technique investigated in the current study is based on a Hybrid SVELM-GOLF to evaluate time series directly from the dataset. The data smoothening, filtering, elimination of outliners and segmentation process are carried out in the preprocessing stage. Followed by preprocessing, the features are extracted for classification purposes. Here, a novel Hybrid Support Vector Extreme Learning Model based Grasshopper Optimization with Levy Flight (Hybrid SVELM-GOLF) technique is proposed to estimate the probability of cylinder condition (i.e. defective or healthy) in the ship. The simulation results display that the proposed hybrid SVELM-GOLF approach achieves a higher rate of prediction accuracy of about 96.2% as well as precision, recall, specificity and F1-score by 95.2%, 95%, 95.8% and 94.9% than other compared approaches. Thus, the hybrid SVELM-GOLF approach gains the higher capability to recognize suspicious patterns and localize defective regions.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; MODEL
AB Accurate load forecasting plays an important role in promoting low-carbon energy and high-quality utilization of electricity, as well as carbon reduction and safety in energy and power systems. The complexity of power system trends leads to widespread uncertainty in load forecasting. This article analyzes the internal mechanisms of load and meteorological factors at the level of multidimensional uncertainty and proposes a bidirectional memory feature hybrid model based on a new intelligent optimization method. The VMD optimized by gray wolf decomposes the electricity load data into different information modal components. The decomposed components are statistically analyzed with multidimensional uncertainty analysis to extract statistical patterns. The GTO part is optimized according to the fitness value to update the population and global optimal solution. Furthermore, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to extract potential features from load and meteorological data and enhance the correlation between input and output data. Then, short-term load forecasting is realized by using bi-directional short-term memory neural network (BiLSTM). The results show that the proposed model has smaller errors than several commonly used models, and has higher prediction accuracy. It can provide some new ideas for relevant departments to carry out power economic dispatch work in low-carbon modes.

   self-correction triplet loss; Joint learning; Noisy labels
AB Current person re-identification (ReID) methods heavily rely on well-annotated training data, and their performance suffers from significant degradation in the presence of noisy labels that are ubiquitous in real life scenes. The reason is that noisy labels not only affect the prediction results of the classifier, but also impede feature refinement, making it difficult to distinguish between different person features. To address these issues, we propose an Adaptive Self-correction Classification (ASC) loss and an Adaptive Margin Self correction Triplet (AMSTri) loss. Specifically, ASC loss helps the network to produce better predictions by balancing annotations and prediction labels, and pays more attention to the minority samples with the help of a focusing factor. On the other hand, the AMSTri loss introduces an adaptive margin that varies with sample features to accommodate complex data variations, and utilizes predicted labels to generate reliable triples for feature refinement. We then present an end-to-end adaptive self-correction joint training framework incorporating ASC loss and AMSTri loss to achieve a robust ReID model. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms most existing counterparts.

ID COMBINING MULTIPLE CLUSTERINGS; CONSENSUS
AB Existing locally weighted ensemble clustering algorithms strive to weight each cluster and take into account the differences among all clusters, but they tend to ignore the basic cluster labels. The purpose of this paper is to combine the influence of cluster level and the base clustering level in a unified ensemble clustering framework. A novel two-level weighted ensemble cluster method (TWEC) is proposed, which inserts a global weighting strategy into a local ensemble cluster learning framework. First, the cluster uncertainty based on an entropy criterion is refined by considering the base clustering labels for each cluster. Then, the two-level uncertainty is converted to cluster reliability via improved ensemble-driven cluster validity measure. Finally, two novel consensus functions are developed. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed TWEC framework by comparing it with ten comparison algorithms on fourteen real-world datasets and twenty synthetic datasets. The results show that TWEC framework can improve the robustness and stability of clustering.

AB Rolling bearing is a key component with the high fault rate in the rotary machines, and its fault diagnosis is important for the safe and healthy operation of the entire machine. In recent years, the deep learning has been widely used for the mechanical fault diagnosis. However, in the process of equipment operation, its state data always presents unbalanced. Number of effective data in different states is different and usually the gap is large, which makes it difficult to directly conduct deep learning. This paper proposes a new data enhancement method combining the resampling and Conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks-Gradient Penalty (CWGAN-GP), and uses the gray images-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to realize the intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. First, the resampling is used to expand the small number of samples to a large level. Second, the conditional label in Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) is combined with WGAN-GP to control the generated samples. Meanwhile, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) is used to filter the samples to obtain the high-quality expanded data set. Finally, CNN is used to train the obtained dataset and carry out the fault classification. In the experiment, a single, compound and mixed fault cases of rolling bearings are successively simulated. For each case, the different sets considering the imbalance ratio of data are constructed, respectively. The results show that the method proposed significantly improves the fault diagnosis accuracy of rolling bearings, which provides a feasible way for the intelligent diagnosis of mechanical component with the complex fault modes and unbalanced small data.

AB text summarization is a classic sequence-to-sequence natural language generation task. In order to improve the quality of unsupervised abstract text summarization in unsupervised mode, we propose two constraints for training text summarization model, embedding space constraint and information ratio constraint. We construct a generative adversarial network with two discriminators based on these two constraints (TC-SUM-GAN). We use unsupervised and supervised methods to train the model in the experiment. Experimental results show that the ROUGE-1 value of the unsupervised TC-SUM-GAN increases by 12.57 points compared with the basic model and at least 1.96 points compared with other comparative models. The ROUGE scores of the supervised TC-SUM-GAN are also improved. TC-SUM-GAN achieves very competitive results for the metrics of ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2. In addition, the abstracts generated by our model are closer to those generated manually.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been enormously successful in a variety of image recognition tasks. Robustness is an important metric to evaluate the quality of CNNs. However, recent research shows that CNNs are particularly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes an adversarial defense method to increase the robustness of CNNs, namely, SCADefender. The proposed method trains a reformer on adversarial examples and the training set of a target classifier. The architecture of the reformer is stacked convolutional autoencoder. The adversarial examples are generated by using various adversarial attacks such as untargeted FGSM, untargeted CW L2 and untargeted BIS. Given an input image, the trained reformer could remove the adversarial perturbations with a low computational cost. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the proposed method is compared with PuVAE, MagNet, and adversarial training on three well-known datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. In terms of the average detection rate, the proposed method outperforms other methods. While the proposed method achieves an average detection rate of 97.78% for MNIST, 90.43% for Fashion-MNIST, and 80.64% for CIFAR-10, the comparable methods achieve only 23.69- 86.18% for MNIST, 63.90-79.70% for Fashion-MNIST, and 25.55-77.36% for CIFAR-10.

AB This paper presents a novel adaptive neurochaotic fuzzy control system based on type-2 fuzzy systems to reduce seismic responses in multistory structures with active tuned mass dampers under near-field and far-field earthquakes. In this proposed control system, the whole parameters of the plant are assumed to be completely unknown, the structural model is estimated using a multilayer perceptron neural network, and the system's Jacobian is extracted. The online estimation model is used, and the controller parameters are adaptively trained using the extended Kalman filter and error back-propagation method. Subsequently, the control force is applied to the active tuned mass damper, and the control objectives are met. The adaptive controller does not require initial settings, and a fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative controller is added to maximize stability and robustness against seismic vibration. A simple adaptive controller optimized by a particle swarm is also presented as an innovation. Comparing the performance of the improved simple adaptive controller and adaptive neurochaotic fuzzy controller, the proposed controllers appear more efficient and accurate. However, the superiority of the novel adaptive neurochaotic fuzzy over the improved simple adaptive controller in reducing maximum displacement, acceleration, drift, and base shear while maintaining acceptable performance under parametric uncertainties and seismic conditions is substantial.

TI Unsupervised Portrait Drawing Generation for Free Styles
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION
AB Artistic portrait drawing (APDrawing) generation has seen progress in recent years. However, due to the naturally high scarcity and artistry, it is difficult to collect large-scale labeled and paired data and generally divide drawing styles into several specific recognized categories. Existing works suffer from the limited labeled data and naive manual division of drawing styles according to the corresponding artists. They cannot adapt to the actual situations, for example, a single artist might have multiple drawing styles and APDrawings from different artists might share similar styles. In this paper, we propose to use unlabeled and unpaired data and perform the task in an unsupervised manner. Without manual division of drawing styles, we take each portrait drawing as a unique style and introduce self-supervised feature learning to learn free styles for unlabeled portrait drawings. Besides, we devise a style bank and a decoupled cycle structure to take over two main considerations in the task: generation quality and style control. Extensive experiments show that our model is more adaptable to different style inputs than state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper aims to analyze the design and application of a robust learning environment using Chinese as a foreign language in the context of web-based teaching. The study employs a carefully planned environment with cutting-edge educational technology and pedagogical techniques for comprehensive language and cultural learning. It creates a browser/server (B/S) framework for teaching Chinese as a foreign language, including system structure, logical design, database integration, and operations, respectively. Specific features like the five-tier logical framework spanning representation and business logic levels are elaborated. The research also presents a resource model that optimizes user preferences and knowledge links using an adaptive multi-objective particle swarm optimization technique, resulting in an efficient and effective learning system. Finally, this study proposes a system for Teaching and Learning Chinese as a foreign language (TCFL) that uses a client-side browser and a server-side browser. Client-side browser provides access to educational materials. Interaction and navigation by the user lead to content presentation and rendering, which displays text, videos, and interactive features. Data management and retrieval manage user requests and business logic on the server side, drawing from a data repository. The scalability and performance of the proposed TCFL system assure smooth operation, while centralized control and governance manage courses and material. The experimental assessment demonstrates the remarkable performance of the suggested TCFL system across critical criteria. The suggested system outperforms other techniques by achieving outstanding results such as increased learning efficiency of 82.4%, increased user engagement and interaction rates of 87.3%, and tailored adaptability with a customization index of 0.865 and adaptive learning rate of 89.5%. The system's outstanding technical integration, excellent learning outcome enhancement of 82.4%, and practical pedagogical techniques highlight its complete and revolutionary design. This work marks a crucial turning point in the history of learning environments for foreigners. It covers critical language acquisition, user engagement, personalization, and adaptation by pioneering a holistic and technology-infused TCFL system. These accomplishments can change foreign language learning and provide the groundwork for future research and innovation in building global optimum and immersive learning environments for learners.

AB Cognitive radio network (CRNs) has been emerging and innovative technology in transmission of dynamic/automatic between different vehicles. An innovative idea in vehicular communication is the use of ad hoc characteristics to configure auto nodes on the fly, allowing for real-time data transmission via the Internet in vehicular ad hoc networks. To boost network infrastructure and strong data connection between vehicles in wireless vehicle ad hoc networks, several node auto-configuration schemas and node address-related methodologies were applied. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Node Selection with Opportunistic Routing (DNSOR) a method for reducing the time it takes for information to be forwarded between vehicles in ad hoc networks by taking advantage of the inherent mobility of vehicle relationships. Each vehicle node in an ad hoc network uses a copy of the data from all the other vehicles to calculate the network's density. Extensive simulation findings show that the suggested methodology outperforms the standard mobility-based routing calculation approaches in vehicle ad hoc networks by increasing QoS while decreasing overhead.

AB Urban mobility stands as a fundamental element worthy of consideration by both society and its leaders. Often, decisions in this realm are made by governing figures without duly factoring in the preferences and needs of citizens. In our study, we delve into the changes that have unfolded within Barcelona from the standpoint of its users. The primary aim of this article is to observe the preferences that these users hold regarding the array of mobility options available to them in the urban environment. To this end, we've incorporated various aspects of significant relevance and contemporary presence in today's society, such as mobility and sustainability, focusing specifically on the two most frequently used types of commercial passenger vehicles (CPV) within urban contexts: taxis and ride-hailing services. To gather the necessary sample data, a survey was conducted with a significance level of 95%. Following an exhaustive examination of the existing literature surrounding these concepts, we proceeded with the analysis of the sample using neural networks. The outcomes garnered encompass user receptiveness to the technological evolution shaping the sector, the utilization of mobile applications, a predisposition to opt for fixed tariffs, and the pivotal role of new blockchain-based technologies (NFTs and fan tokens) in influencing user decision-making.

AB In the proposed research article, the grey wolf optimization (GWO) technique is utilized to optimize the proportional (P) integral (I) derivative (D) (PID) controller/regulator gain parameters in three-area grid-connected power networks. The interconnected power plant covers thermal plants, hydro plants, and nuclear power plants. The proposed controller is used as a secondary controller in the power system to perform load frequency control (LFC). Under unforeseen load conditions, the system frequency deviates from the norm. To control and stabilize this oscillation, the LFC system is used. During the investigation, a step load perturbation of one percent (SLP 1%) is applied for the analysis of the thermal power plant. The response of the suggested optimization technique-designed regulator performance is equated with the genetic algorithm (GA)-tuned, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-tuned, and ant colony optimization (ACO) technique-tuned PID regulator response. The performance response is evidence that the GWO-based PID regulator provides a regulated response with minimal time-domain specification parameters (settling time, peak shoots) over other tuning methods. The effectiveness and robustness of the improved response of the suggested technique-optimized controller are verified with various load values (1%, 2%, and 10% SLP) and nominal parameter (R, Tp, and Tij) variations (+/- 25% & +/- 50%) from its nominal value.

AB Quantum software engineering is a field of study that combines principles from quantum computing and classical software engineering. One potential application of quantum software engineering is in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), specifically in the localization of nodes. WSNs are equipped to gather information by detecting the surroundings around smart cities. Numerous applications related to Mobility in Smart Cities (MSC) struggle with routing, security, deployment, extended lifetime, data computation, and localization. Many academics have developed various Computational Intelligence-based techniques for the aforementioned problems to attain high-level performance of MSCs. Quantum software engineering can potentially enhance the accuracy and efficiency of node localization in WSNs. Node localization refers to the process used to locate the target node. Accurately determining the coordinates of static nodes is simple, but locating mobile nodes is more difficult. The performance of the MSC is directly impacted by localization accuracy. In this article, the Quantum-based Salp Swarm Algorithm (QBSSA) is implemented for a range-based and range-free framework. The performance of already existing techniques is evaluated and compared with QBSSA, such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and H-best Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO). The mobile anchor node moves in the whole network in a Hilbert path topology and localizes the mobile targets in the network by their random deployment in the area of communication. To minimize the effect of Line of Sight propagation, the Hilbert trajectory is used. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the proposed approach can localize the mobile target with a two-fold reduction in error as opposed to PSO and a 1.5-fold reduction in error as opposed to HPSO, at the same time as the computational time is significantly reduced.

AB Sustainable development requires social development and economic construction to be coordinated with the carrying capacity of the ecological environment. It necessitates adhering to the concept of sustainable development while pursuing economic development and social progress, improving the effective utilization rate of natural resources, and protecting and improving the ecological environment in which people live. This paper takes the e-commerce trade ecological industrial park in Dalian Economic Development Zone as an example to comprehensively evaluate its sustainable development ability using the state-of-the-art techniques of soft computing. Soft computing has recently gained appeal over traditional hard computing because it can cope with uncertainty just as easily as a human can. The basic aim of the study is to avoid excessive resource and environmental pressure hindering the coordinated development of various subsystems of the park. First, an evaluation index system containing four subsystem elements of the environment, society, economy, and resources was constructed, and the importance of each index in the evaluation index system was calculated. Second, the distance model and fuzzy logic of soft computing were used to comprehensively evaluate the sustainability of the selected industrial park. Six criteria were established to describe the sustainability of the industrial park based on the opinions of industry professionals, with references to the research findings of local and international forerunners. The finding of the paper shows that the development level index of each subsystem of the industrial park has continued to rise, except for a few cases. The result also demonstrates that the overall coordinated development degree of the park has increased year by year from 2010 to 2019. This means that the coordinated development level has improved from the initial barely coordinated level in 2010 to the high-quality coordinated development level in 2019; however, the overall coordinated development degree is still less than 0.9. Through this study, it is possible to judge the sustainable development ability of the four subsystems of the industrial park and whether it meets the relevant standards of resource consumption and environmental protection stipulated by the state. It is of great practical significance for promoting the formation of a good ecological chain between enterprises in the park, realizing resource recycling, and reducing waste discharge.

AB Human activity recognition is an application of machine learning with the aim of identifying activities from the gathered activity raw data acquired by different sensors. In medicine, human gait is commonly analyzed by doctors to detect abnormalities and determine possible treatments for the patient. Monitoring the patient's activity is paramount in evaluating the treatment's evolution. This type of classification is still not enough precise, which may lead to unfavorable reactions and responses. A novel methodology that reduces the complexity of extracting features from multimodal sensors is proposed to improve human activity classification based on accelerometer data. A sliding window technique is used to demarcate the first dominant spectral amplitude, decreasing dimensionality and improving feature extraction. In this work, we compared several state-of-art machine learning classifiers evaluated on the HuGaDB dataset and validated on our dataset. Several configurations to reduce features and training time were analyzed using multimodal sensors: all-axis spectrum, single-axis spectrum, and sensor reduction.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms not only expanded the application areas of UAVs but also brought more complex challenges to security. Both the data collected by UAVs and UAVs themselves are easy targets for hackers. Once a hacker has intercepted communication information or hijacked a UAV, it can cause the disclosure of information and even affect the normal flight of the UAV. In terms of authentication, existing research focuses on building peer-to-peer networks through devices that support blockchain deployments at the edge nodes to form blockchain networks. UAVs cannot run blockchains directly, so fog nodes need to be introduced to assist UAVs in achieving authentication. This paper proposes a UAV authentication solution based on the fog node-assisted blockchain. The solution incorporates smart contracts to ensure trust, along with on-chain registration and authentication for UAVs. In the design of this paper, the main use is made of fog nodes at the edge of each block. The fog nodes serve as agents to register and authenticate the UAVs in their area on the blockchain, thus enabling the authentication of UAVs in different fog node areas.

Meanwhile, the paper compares the computational overheads, and within 10 UAVs, the computational overhead of this scheme is less than 50 ms, which is significantly lower than the other two schemes.

   Complex optimization task; Deep neural networks
AB Neural architecture search (NAS) is an extremely complex optimization task. Recently, population-based optimization algorithms, such as evolutionary algorithm, have been adopted as search strategies for designing neural networks automatically. Various population-based NAS methods are promising in searching for high-performance neural architectures. The explosion gravitation field algorithm (EGFA) inspired by the formation process of planets is a novel population-based optimization algorithm with excellent global optimization capability and remarkable efficiency, compared with the classical population-based algorithms, such as GA and PSO. Thus, this paper attempts to develop a more efficient NAS method, called EGFA-NAS, by utilizing the work mechanisms of EGFA, which relaxes the search discrete space to a continuous one and then utilizes EGFA and gradient descent to optimize the weights of the candidate architectures in conjunction. To reduce the computational cost, a training strategy by utilizing the population mechanism of EGFA-NAS is proposed. In addition, a weight inheritance strategy for the new generated dust individuals is proposed during the explosion operation to improve performance and efficiency. The performance of EGFA-NAS is investigated in two typical micro search spaces: NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS, and compared with various kinds of state-of-the-art NAS competitors. The experimental results demonstrate that EGFA-NAS is able to match or outperform the state-of-the-art NAS methods on image classification tasks with remarkable efficiency improvement.

TI Improving table detection for document images using boundary
SO COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Table detection; Deep learning; Document image; Object detection
AB Locating tables in document images is the first step to extracting table information, and high location precision is required. The dominant approach of table detection is based on an object detection algorithm, and the detector defines the prediction task as a regression problem, which inevitably leads to positioning errors. To address this issue, this paper presents an approach called Border Line Correction (BLC) to refine the rough prediction results of the original detector through the table boundary lines extracted from the document image. Our approach transforms the regression task into a classification problem, thus avoiding the inherent regression error of the object detection algorithm. Traditional annotation methods are inadequate for table detection tasks as they fail to capture the completeness and purity of the detection results. Therefore, this study treats the correct position of a table as a tolerance region. Additionally, to overcome the limitations of existing datasets in the materials domain, we collected 1183 samples from scientific literature in the materials field and created the MatTab dataset, annotating the tables with tolerance regions. This paper use Cascade RCNN with Swin Transformer as baseline models, and BLC is utilized to optimize the detection results. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements with BLC at an IOU of 0.95 on the MatTab, ICDAR2019, and ICDAR2017 datasets. In MatTab, the percentage of correctly detected complete and pure tables increased from 72.3% to 82.1%.

   Reinforcement learning (RL); Objective penalty function method
ID MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; OPTIMIZATION
AB Trajectory tracking is a key technology for controlling the autonomous vehicles effectively and stably to track the reference trajectory. How to handle the various constraints in trajectory tracking is very challenging. The recently proposed generalized exterior point method (GEP) shows high computational efficiency and closed-loop performance in solving the constrained trajectory tracking problem. However, the neural networks used in the GEP may suffer from the ill-conditioning issue during model training, which result in a slow or even non-converging training convergence process and the control output of the policy network being suboptimal or even severely constraint-violating. To effectively deal with the large-scale nonlinear state-wise constraints and avoid the ill-conditioning issue, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) method called the actor-critic objective penalty function method (ACOPFM) for trajectory tracking in autonomous driving. We adopt an integrated decision and control (IDC)-based planning and control scheme to transform the trajectory tracking problem into MPC-based nonlinear programming problems and embed the objective penalty function method into an actor-critic solution framework. The nonlinear programming problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem and employed as a loss function for model updating of the policy network, and the ill-conditioning issue is avoided by alternately performing gradient descent and adaptively adjusting the penalty parameter. The convergence of ACOPFM is proved. The simulation results demonstrate that the ACOPFM converges to the optimal control strategy fast and steadily, and perform well under the multi-lane test scenario.

AB Multi-agent cooperation and coordination are often essential for task fulfillment. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) can effectively learn the solutions to problems, but its application is still primarily restricted by the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Therefore, the focus of MADRL research is placed on how to effectively explore the environment and collect good experience with rich information to strengthen cooperative behaviors and optimize policy learning. To address this problem, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperation policy gradient method called multi-agent proximal policy optimization based on self-imitation learning and random network distillation (MAPPOSR). MAPPOSR consists of two policy gradient-based additional components, namely (1) random network distillation (RND) exploration bonus component that produces intrinsic rewards and encourages agents to access new states and actions, thereby helping them explore better trajectories and avoiding the algorithm prematurely converging or getting stuck in local optima; and (2) self-imitation learning (SIL) policy update component that stores and reuses high-return trajectory samples generated by agents themselves, thereby strengthening their cooperation and boosting learning efficiency. The experimental results show that in addition to effectively solving the hard-exploration problem, the proposed method significantly outperforms other SOTA MADRL algorithms in learning efficiency as well as in escaping local optima. Moreover, the effect of different function inputs on algorithm performance is investigated in the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, based on which a joint-observation coding method based on individual is developed. By encouraging the agent to focus more on the local observation information of other agents related to it and abandon global state information provided by the environment, the developed coding method can remove the effects of excessive value function input dimensions and redundant feature information on algorithm performance.

AB The entire world is witnessing challenges in climate change and control catastrophes. Addressing and investigating sustainable climate and urban thermal harmony can be done by getting deeper into pattern and anomalies identification in land surface temperature studies. In this paper, we have discussed duo satellite-based remotely sensed land surface temperature prediction using various methods of machine learning in the western Indian smart city, Ajmer from data range 2003-2021. Quad LST datasets (two for daytime and two for nighttime) from MODIS sensor on board Aqua and Terra satellites were incubated in this study. In the field of remote sensing, neural networks and the essence of artificial intelligence are now being smelled in a diverse assortment of applications, and regular new application proposals are being made. In the present study, machine learning techniques are used to predict the temperature of the same day and future day. To evaluate the accuracy of the predictions made by each method, the R-2 score and RMSE were calculated. R-2 score is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). A score of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a score of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability in the data. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is a measure of the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. By calculating these metrics, the researchers and urban dwellers are able to determine the accuracy of the different Machine Learning methods. These findings and future developments can be used in land surface temperature prediction in different contexts such as quality and quantity of available different satellite data, duration, and study area in climate studies, earth and atmospheric sciences.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DE Partial label learning; Multi-class partial hinge loss; Graph laplacian
   regularization; Loss function
AB As an important branch of weakly supervised learning, partial label learning (PLL) tackles the problem where each training instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, among only one is correct. Most existing PLL algorithms elaborately designed loss functions and update strategies to learn potential ground-truth labels among candidate labels with deep neural networks. However, these algorithms are susceptible to the cumulative error caused by noisy label propagation when updating label confidences, this will make the deep models tend to overfit the noisy labels, thereby achieving poor generation performance. To remedy this issue, we propose a general framework multi-class partial hinge loss (MPHL) for PLL, which can disambiguate the candidate labels by optimizing the margin between the maximum modeling output from partial labels and that from non-partial ones. More importantly, the partial hinge loss can adaptively optimize the separation hyperplane to reduce the influence of cumulative error. Meanwhile, we introduce graph laplacian regularization to full mine the relationship between candidate labels of similar instances to constrain the separation hyperplane to improve the robustness of disambiguation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the multi-class partial hinge loss significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts.

TI A modulized lane-follower for driverless vehicles using multi-frame
SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English

DE artificial neural networks; cognition; supervised learning
AB As a fundamental function, lane following plays an important role for driverless vehicles. Unfortunately, lane followers generally confront great difficulty in lane line missed situations caused by vague line, shadows etc. However, for most lane line missed situation, clues of the line may be hidden in prior view of it. Consequently, a lane follower called UNL Lane Follower, which contains two deep learning network modules is proposed. The first module is a lane line detection model called UNET_CLB. Here, the sequence of image frames is utilised rather than only the current frame to deal with the missing lane lines. The second module is a lane-following model called LSTM_DTS, which combines a deep learning attention mechanism (temporal attention network and spatial attention network) with a recurrent neural network. As a result, the proposed UNL Lane Follower produces smoother driving behaviour, especially when a lane line is temporally missed. For better explain ability, the role of each part of the network structure is analysed and explained intuitively. As a modularised network, the UNET_CLB is firstly trained and tested on the TuSimple dataset and CULane dataset. The LSTM_DTS lane follow is then trained and tested on our actual lane following dataset. Finally, the UNL Lane Follower is trained and tested as a whole in a simulation running on Webots, after importing the weight of the two modules trained separately. All testing results showed that the UNL Lane Follower can provide better robustness and accuracy for lane line following mission in the line missed situations.

AB In this paper we propose an Ant System (AS) SimU-AS and an Ant Colony System (ACS) SimU-TACS, both used to solve a planning problem in the Health Simulation Center SimUSante. This center proposes up to 500 different training sessions based on simulation learning for healthcare staff. The data, constraints and objective of the SimUSante problem, which is close to the academic Curriculum-Based Courses Timetabling (CB-CTT) Problem, are detailed. To guide ants towards promising areas of the search space, SimU-AS and SimU-TACS rely on several heuristics that aim to reduce the makespan of each session. Moreover, SimU-TACS combines features like the ������-greedy strategy, the tabu memory system and restarts to improve the search. SimU-AS and SimU-TACS were compared to SimU-VNS, a Variable Neighborhood Search, to SimU-MMAS, a hybridized Max-Min Ant System, and to optimal solutions when achievable. They were also compared to the open source KHE solver by relaxing the precedence constraints. Experiments show that SimU-TACS outperforms all other methods, even for the largest instances, without violating any hard constraints. Moreover it provides optimality for 31/48 instances.

AB This paper proposes a text-independent method for authorship identification using handwritten word images. Our method is text-independent and imposes no limitations on the size of the input word images being analyzed. To begin with, the SIFT algorithm is utilized to extract key-point regions (fragments) across different levels of abstraction, encompassing allographs, characters, or character combinations. These fragments are subsequently processed through a CNN network, yielding feature maps corresponding to convolution layers. The information in these maps is then transformed into a fixed-dimension representation using a modified version of the HOG feature descriptor.The noteworthy contribution of our proposal lies in harnessing additional cues from CNN's feature maps for writer identification. We propose a measure to gauge the importance or 'saliency' of feature maps within a CNN layer during training. This measure originates from applying Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to Histogram Of Gradient (HOG) features. Once saliency values are obtained, we combine them with HOG representations to create writer descriptors tailored to a CNN layer. The derived descriptors are then passed through a set of SVM classifiers that are scored at two levels to determine the identity of the handwritten word image.The efficacy of our system has been demonstrated on the word-level data of the CVL, IAM and CERUG-EN datasets with an accuracy of 82.10%, 87.68%, and 75.80% respectively. The results obtained are shown to be promising when compared with previous works.

AB Advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) can effectively enhance driving and safety performance. Due to the inherent limitations of in-vehicle technologies concerning information sharing, existing studies mainly focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of onboard sensor-based individual ADAS functions rather than their collaborative effectiveness. Thanks to the emerging connected vehicle (CV) technologies, it is viable to physically realize the collaboration and coordination between different ADAS functions. This study aims to synthesize seven ADAS functions into an integrated advanced driving assistance system (iADAS) in a CV environment. The seven ADAS functions include omni-directional collision warning, lane-change warning, curve speed warning, emergency event notification, car-following guidance, identification of variable speed limits, and information services. The activation indicators and activation conditions of these ADAS functions are derived based on a single local coordinate system. This derivation has considered the real-time motion states of the ego and surrounding vehicles. Different ADAS functions are classified based on their roles in accident reduction, traffic efficiency enhancement, and driver convenience improvement. Afterwards, their priority of releasing information is set by considering the classification and primary functionality. Finally, the effectiveness of the iADAS is validated in field tests. Testing results reveal that the iADAS helps reduce rear-end collisions and prevent rollovers or sideslips on curved roads. Furthermore, younger drivers respond faster with higher driving stability regarding lateral collision warnings. Young, well-educated, and low-risk taking drivers maintain a short but safe time headway to the leading vehicle.

AB This paper presents medBERT.de, a pre-trained German BERT model specifically designed for the German medical domain. The model has been trained on a large corpus of 4.7 Million German medical documents and has been shown to achieve new state-of-the-art performance on eight different medical benchmarks covering a wide range of disciplines and medical document types. In addition to evaluating the overall performance of the model, this paper also conducts a more in-depth analysis of its capabilities. We investigate the impact of data dedu-plication on the model's performance, as well as the potential benefits of using more efficient tokenization methods. Our results indicate that domain-specific models such as medBERT.de are particularly useful for longer texts, and that deduplication of training data does not necessarily lead to improved performance. Furthermore, we found that efficient tokenization plays only a minor role in improving model performance, and attribute most of the improved performance to the large amount of training data. To encourage further research, the pre-trained model weights and new benchmarks based on radiological data are made publicly available for use by the sci-entific community.

AB This paper develops a trustworthy deep learning model that considers electricity demand (G) and local climate conditions. The model utilises Multi-Head Self-Attention Transformer (TNET) to capture critical information from G, to attain reliable predictions with local climate (rainfall, radiation, humidity, evaporation, and maximum and minimum temperatures) data from Energex substations in Queensland, Australia. The TNET model is then evaluated with deep learning models (Long-Short Term Memory LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM BILSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit GRU, Convolutional Neural Networks CNN, and Deep Neural Network DNN) based on robust model assessment metrics. The Kernel Density Estimation method is used to generate the prediction interval (PI) of electricity demand forecasts and derive probability metrics and results to show the developed TNET model is accurate for all the substations. The study concludes that the proposed TNET model is a reliable electricity demand predictive tool that has high accuracy and low predictive errors and could be employed as a stratagem by demand modellers and energy policy-makers who wish to incorporate climatic factors into electricity demand patterns and develop national energy market insights and analysis systems.

AB Fine-grained image classification is a challenging task due to the small inter-class variance, the large intra-class difference, and the small training data. Traditional methods typically rely on large-scale training samples with annotated part annotations, making them costly and severely limiting their application area. In this paper, we propose an effective and weakly supervised fine-grained classification framework. In this framework, a discriminative class-specific spectral feature is learned by intra-class spectral coupling and inter-class spectral decoupling under the weak supervision of image-level category labels, and then the new input images are classified based on the learned class-specific spectral feature. Different from existing strong supervised methods, the proposed technique creatively combines weak supervision of the image-level category labels with unsupervised spectral graph decomposition, not relying on large-scale training samples with dense part annotations, which are heavily labor-consuming. The performance of the proposed methods has been verified on four kinds of typical datasets: the JAFFE dataset, the Yale database, the UCI-CMU face database, and the neural foramina dataset. The satisfactory classification results have been achieved by the proposed method in expression recognition on the JAFFE dataset (with a mean accuracy of 95.31%), face recognition on the Yale database (with a mean accuracy of 98.79%), object recognition on the UCI-CMU face database (with a mean accuracy of 96.96%), and disease grading on the neural foramina dataset (with a mean accuracy of 92.09%). Compared with most state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has superior classification performance in the small data set.

ID BEVERAGE; CONSUMERS; PAIRINGS
AB Food-wine pairing is an essential study in the culinary world and requires extensive research of the underlying food and wine pairing principles. To understand the principles of pairing, we must understand the characteristics of food, and wine, the interaction between them, and certain classic food-wine pairing norms that are religiously adhered to. To take this understanding to a broader class of masses, there is a need for a recommender system that considers all the trivial and non-trivial details of food-wine pairing and the preferences of individual users to provide the perfect pairing. To apply these pairing principles in the context of recommender systems, we require abstract features such as flavor, aroma, major ingredients, type of meat, and many others. To achieve this, our recommender system relies on text mining techniques and sentiment analysis at its core to extract the relevant information from the text in the dataset. Such extensive feature engineering has not been undertaken before in the context of generating food and wine recommendations. We have created a recommender system that em-bodies the age-old essence of wine paring, considering not only the food wine characteristics but also the user's preference of pairing (congruent or contrast).

AB Rate of Recovery during the rehabilitation procedure is not effectively evaluated due to existing limitations of measurement tools and large human variability. The conventional way to treat lower-limb injuries is by conducting a physician-guided rehabilitation process that could take several weeks or months. But the process of estimating the rate of recovery is entirely based on the expertise of a therapist. Moreover, it remains unclear to a large extent about the factors have contributed to the success of treatment, the most effective rehabilitation duration, and recovery progression rate. To address these limitations, a random subspace ensemble k-nearest neighbor (RSEnkNN) model is proposed to predict the rehabilitation duration of an individual after initial baseline assessment of gait trajectories. The model is trained using an open-source dataset comprising 211 healthy and 2084 patients with functional gait disorders. The proposed model is able to predict rehabilitation duration with an accuracy of 88-89 % in case of ankle, calcaneus, and hip injury while the success rate of 82 % is achieved for knee disorders. Features computed from ground reaction force, measures of postural steadiness, and bilateral symmetry turn out to be effective in predicting the early, moderate, or late recovery of an individual. The significantly contributing features for each anomaly class are reported using recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique to support clinicians. Thereafter, recovery rate is determined using a novel metric Rate of Gait Recovery (RoGR) index that could be effective for treatment planning and re-scheduling of therapy sessions (if required). This work determined that the most effective rehabilitation period is 2-6 weeks post-surgery for restoration to normal walk. Thus, a prediction tool for strengthening clinical decision-making is proposed to support early rehabilitation.

AB False data injection attacks (FDIA) severely impact the secure operation of power grid, making accurate FDIA detection crucial for stability of power grid. Considering the complex spatiotemporal dependency of the power grid, this paper proposes a new FDIA detection method based on the Spatial-Temporal Transformer network to effectively integrate the topology and data of the power grid. In the Spatial Transformer network, the selfattention mechanism is utilized to capture the global dependency of the power grid, while the graph convolutional layer is employed to establish the local dependency of the power grid. In the Temporal Transformer network, the self-attention mechanism is employed to capture the long-term sequence dependency of power grid data, overcoming the limitation of long short-term memory network (LSTM) which can only model limited temporal dependency. Therefore, the Spatial-Temporal Transformer network can effectively mine spatiotemporal features in power grid, improving detection accuracy. The proposed detection method is evaluated using real load data from NYISO in IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.

AB Cross-border retail firms are often exposed to a lack of working capital for their procurement, especially for sudden increases in demand on special holidays such as Black Friday. This paper studies a cross-border product stochastic inventory management problem where capital-constrained retailers can obtain additional working capital through bonded warehouse financing and entrusted loan financing. This study obtains an optimal inventory policy in which retailers may purchase cross-border products with financing to sell to markets with uncertain demand. The results show that entrusted loan financing helps capital-constrained retailers increase their inventory procurement. Specifically, when capital levels are low, capital-constrained retailers opt for a mixed financing option of bonded warehouse and entrusted loan. Furthermore, the increase in bonded warehouse financing limits could weaken the reliance of capital-constrained retailers on entrusted loan financing. Interestingly, bonded warehouse financing and entrusted loan financing enable the formation of a liability network among retailers. While there is no risk contagion in the liability network when they sell heterogeneous products, the risk of losses due to fire sales remains. This paper further characterizes the payment and clearing model and derives the optimal payment-clearing strategy with fire sales of stagnant products. The results suggest that managers can utilize our designed procurement system with bonded warehouse financing and entrusted loan financing to purchase products without worrying about insufficient financing.

AB Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) face the formidable challenge of large-scale missing data, particularly in the imputation of traffic data. Existing studies have mainly relied on modeling network-level spatiotemporal correlations to address this issue. However, these methods often overlook the rich semantic information (e.g., road infrastructure, sensor location, etc.) inherent in road networks when capturing network-wide spatiotemporal correlations. We address this limitation by presenting the Graph Transformer-based Traffic Data Imputation (GT-TDI) model, which imputes missing values in extensive traffic data by leveraging spatiotemporal semantic understanding of road networks. The proposed model leverages semantic descriptions that capture the spatial and temporal dynamics of traffic across road networks, enhancing its capacity to infer comprehensive spatiotemporal relationships. Moreover, to augment the model's capabilities, we employ a Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt engineering to enable natural and intuitive interactions with the traffic data imputation system, allowing users to query and request in plain language, without requiring expert knowledge or complex mathematical models. The proposed model, GT-TDI, utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer architectures to perform large-scale traffic data imputation using deficient observations, sensor social connectivity, and semantic descriptions as inputs. We evaluate the GT-TDI model on the PeMS freeway dataset and benchmark it against cutting-edge models. The experimental evidence demonstrates that GT-TDI surpasses the cutting-edge approaches in scenarios with intricate patterns and varying rates of missing data.

AB Non-standard fuzzy sets play a significant role in uncertainty modeling. In addition to membership and non-membership degree, how to handle the hesitant degree is the key issue in the uncertain information process. In this paper, we model the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) under the belief structure and measure its uncertainty based on fractal-based belief (FB) entropy. A novel fuzzy entropy for PFS called belief structure -based Pythagorean fuzzy (BSPF) entropy is proposed, whose effectiveness and advantages are proven based on mathematical analysis and numerical examples. A comparative analysis between BSPF entropy and other methods shows that BSPF entropy can obtain more reasonable results. Besides, a BSPF entropy-based multi -criteria decision-making (MCDM) method and a classification method are designed to solve practical problems. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods in solving real-world problems of decision-making and classification.

ID DECISION-MAKING; PERSPECTIVE
AB Recently, a theory called random permutation set (RPS) is proposed, which is the extension of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. It defines a permutation event space (PES) to represent the order of events and uses the RPS to represent the support of permutation events. In addition, this theory fuses multiple RPSs by developing the left orthogonal sum (LOS) and right orthogonal sum (ROS) algorithms. However, our experiments have found that when two RPSs are highly conflicting, using the LOS or the ROS algorithm to fuse them will generate conflicting results. Therefore, this paper proposes the symmetric Renyi-Permutation (SRP) divergence of the RPS and a LOS-SRP algorithm for conflict management. Furthermore, existing RPS-based reliability assessment methods have the drawbacks of subjectivity and low accuracy, which prompts us to combine SRP divergence with the RPS and propose the RASRP algorithm for reliability assessment. Experimental results show that the RASRP algorithm performs better than the most advanced existing methods.

ID FACTORIZATION
AB Text clustering is a task for grouping extracted information of the text in different clusters, which has many applications in recommender systems, sentiment analysis, and more. Deep learning-based methods have become increasingly popular due to their high accuracy in identifying nonlinear structures. They usually consist of two major parts: dimensionality reduction and clustering. Autoencoders are simple unsupervised neural networks used for better representation of low-dimensional data and have shown good performance in dealing with nonlinear features. However, while they utilize the Frobenius norm to deal well with Gaussian noise, they are sensitive to outlier data and Laplacian noise. In this paper, a deep autoencoder with an adapted elastic loss for text embedding clustering (EDA-TEC) is proposed. The elastic loss is a combination of the Frobenius norm and L2,1-norm to consider both types of noises. Additionally, to maintain the high-dimensional data geometric structure, a modified graph regularization term based on the weighted cosine similarity measure is used. EDATEC also improves clustering results by considering the sparsity regularization of the manifold representation data. In this jointly end-to-end deep learning model, better representation and text clustering results are achieved with high accuracy on common datasets compared to existing methods.1

   NUMBER
AB Global optimization of high-dimensional non-convex functions arises in many important applications and researches. In this paper, we focus on the minimum energy configuration problem on the unit sphere, whose goal is to determine the minimum-energy configuration of N particles interacting via the standard Coulomb potential or the discrete logarithmic potential on the unit sphere. This is a classic global optimization problem with many important applications in mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry, and is one of the 18 great mathematical problems for the twenty-first century listed by the Fields Medal winner (Smale, 1998). To determine the minimum-energy configuration for these two potential functions, we propose a population -based global optimization algorithm that combines a two-phase local optimization method with early-stopping strategy, a random perturbation operator, a distance-based population update strategy using a novel distance function to measure the difference between solutions, and a population rebuilding method. Computational results show that the proposed algorithm is very competitive compared to the best known results in the literature. In particular, it improves the best-known result for one instance of the classic Thomson problem (i.e., N = 360) widely studied in the literature. The configurations of instances with up to N = 500 particles are systematically optimized for the first time by the proposed algorithm for the discrete logarithmic potential. The comparative study shows that the putative optimal configurations have a high similarity for the Coulomb and logarithmic potentials and that the defects play an important role in reducing the energy of configuration. The energies of particles on the putative optimal configurations are analyzed for the studied logarithmic potential.

AB This work simultaneously addresses the challenges of unseen classes and low-data problems on synthetic aperture radar jamming recognition (SAR-JR). Currently, very few studies have tackled both challenges. Inspired by the success of few-shot learning, which learns a robust model from a few instances, we formulate SAR-JR as a few-shot task in a metric-learning framework to alleviate the above challenges. Against the jamming features with significant dispersion and complex geometric transformations, as well as feature obscuration in time-frequency images (TF), we propose an aggregated-attention deformable convolutional network (A2-DCNet) framework consisting of an aggregated-attention deformable convolutional module (A2 -DC-Module) and a prototype classification module based on polynomial loss (PolyLoss-PC-Module). The former learns informative and refined embeddings from the TF images, while the latter performs the SAR-JR in an embedding space by calculating distances to prototypes of each class. Specifically, the modulated deformable convolution of the A2-DC-Module can capture long-range spatial contextual information from a global perspective, while the aggregated attention is designed to refine the representations of obscured features in the TF images. To further optimize the framework, we introduce a novel PolyLoss and customize the optimal form for our model to learn an embedding space with robust inter-class separability. Finally, to realize few-shot SAR-JR tasks, we simulate a novel dataset called JamSet. Extensive experimental results on our dataset have demonstrated substantial improvement of our proposed A2-DCNet method over the benchmarks.

AB Due to the lack of rotation invariance in traditional convolution operations, even acting a slight rotation on the input can severely degrade the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To address this, we propose a Rotation-Invariant Coordinate Convolution (RIC-C), which achieves natural invariance to arbitrary rotations around the input center without additional trainable parameters or data augmentation. We first evaluate the rotational invariance of RIC-C using the MNIST dataset and compare its performance with most previous rotation-invariant CNN models. RIC-C achieves state-of-the-art classification on the MNIST-rot test set without data augmentation and with lower computational costs. Then, the interchangeability of RIC-C with traditional convolution operations is demonstrated by seamlessly integrating it into common CNN models like VGG, ResNet, and DenseNet. We conduct remote sensing image classification on the NWPU VHR-10, MTARSI and AID datasets and patch matching experiments on the UBC benchmark dataset, showing that RIC-C significantly enhances the performance of CNN models across different applications, especially when training data is limited.

ID FAIRING ALGORITHM
AB In the zinc oxide rotary volatile kiln (ZORVK), an optimal temperature field is essential to balance the strong conflict between zinc recovery rate and carbon emissions. However, the complex and diverse temperature distribution modes make it challenging to quickly obtain optimization results under intricate controllability constraints and multi-conflict production objectives. In this study, a novel constrained multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (CMODRL) approach for temperature field optimization of the ZORVK is proposed. First, an evaluation metric called the uncontrollable factor is designed to quantify the controllability of the temperature field. Then, a dynamic penalty method in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to handle the controllability constraint, in which the penalty coefficient is dynamically adjusted according to the training loss. After that, the Chebyshev scalarization function is introduced as an action selection mechanism in DRL. Finally, the CMODRL is developed by integrating the dynamic penalty and Chebyshev scalarization function into the multi-objective deep reinforcement learning (MODRL) framework. As a result, for any given preference between the two production objectives, the proposed method can rapidly get the Pareto-optimal solution fulfilling the constraint. Moreover, the optimization efficiency of the MODRL-based algorithm is forty times higher than that of the multi-objective genetic algorithm, which serves better for practical optimization problems.

It was also recognized that there was a lower number of citations if the articles were too large or if they had too many references.DiscussionThis analysis helps to establish the factors that must be addressed in order to publish in journals that have a high citation rate. Conclusion: Based on speci?c articles and with speci?c references, it will be possible to increase the probability of citations.

AB CT perfusion imaging is important in the imaging workup of acute ischemic stroke for evaluating affected cerebral tissue. CT perfusion analysis software produces cerebral perfusion maps from commonly noisy spatio-temporal CT perfusion data. High levels of noise can influence the results of CT perfusion analysis, necessitating software tuning. This work proposes a novel approach for CT perfusion analysis that uses physics-informed learning, an optimization framework that is robust to noise. In particular, we propose SPPINN: Spatio-temporal Perfusion Physics-Informed Neural Network and research spatio-temporal physics-informed learning. SPPINN learns implicit neural representations of contrast attenuation in CT perfusion scans using the spatio-temporal coordinates of the data and employs these representations to estimate a continuous representation of the cerebral perfusion parameters. We validate the approach on simulated data to quantify perfusion parameter estimation performance. Furthermore, we apply the method to in-house patient data and the public Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation 2018 benchmark data to assess the correspondence between the perfusion maps and reference standard infarct core segmentations. Our method achieves accurate perfusion parameter estimates even with high noise levels and differentiates healthy tissue from infarcted tissue. Moreover, SPPINN perfusion maps accurately correspond with reference standard infarct core segmentations. Hence, we show that using spatio-temporal physics-informed learning for cerebral perfusion estimation is accurate, even in noisy CT perfusion data. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/lucasdevries/SPPINN.

To introduce the orders and the cost function into the parameter optimization in CNNs, we give a definition of the Hausdorff-like derivative by analyzing the definition of the Hausdorff derivative, and a corresponding improved form is proposed. The improved Hausdorff-like (IHL) derivative is utilized in the parameter training of the back propagation in CNNs, and the orders are introduced in the back propagation for training of parameters. Therefore, we adjust the orders by judging the size of the cost function during the parameter training in CNNs, and the tuning of the orders can flexibly adjust the training speed of the parameters. An adaptive tuning approach for the orders is presented by analyzing the rule of the orders for the IHL derivative. By combining the proposed parameter training method with the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) algorithm, we propose the Adam algorithm with the IHL derivative. The experiments based on residual networks are carried out, and the experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the original algorithm.

AB The vast majority of machine learning research focuses on improving the correctness of the outcomes (i.e., accuracy, error-rate, and other metrics). However, the negative impact of machine learning outcomes can be substantial if the consequences marginalize certain groups of data, especially if certain groups of people are the ones being discriminated against. Thus, recent papers try to tackle the unfair treatment of certain groups of data (humans), but mostly focus on only one sensitive feature with binary values. In this paper, we propose an ensemble boosting FairBoost that takes into consideration fairness as well as accuracy to mitigate unfairness in classification tasks during the model training process. This method tries to close the gap between proposed approaches and real-world applications, where there is often more than one sensitive feature that contains multiple categories. The proposed approach checks the bias and corrects it through the iteration of building the boosted ensemble. The proposed FairBoost is tested within the experimental setting and compared to similar existing algorithms. The results on different datasets and settings show no significant changes in the overall quality of classification, while the fairness of the outcomes is vastly improved.

AB In obstetric sonography, the quality of acquisition of ultrasound scan video is crucial for accurate (manual or automated) biometric measurement and fetal health assessment. However, the nature of fetal ultrasound involves free-hand probe manipulation and this can make it challenging to capture high-quality videos for fetal biometry, especially for the less-experienced sonographer. Manually checking the quality of acquired videos would be time-consuming, subjective and requires a comprehensive understanding of fetal anatomy. Thus, it would be advantageous to develop an automatic quality assessment method to support video standardization and improve diagnostic accuracy of video-based analysis. In this paper, we propose a general and purely data-driven video-based quality assessment framework which directly learns a distinguishable feature representation from high-quality ultrasound videos alone, without anatomical annotations. Our solution effectively utilizes both spatial and temporal information of ultrasound videos. The spatio-temporal representation is learned by a bi-directional reconstruction between the video space and the feature space, enhanced by a key-query memory module proposed in the feature space. To further improve performance, two additional modalities are introduced in training which are the sonographer gaze and optical flow derived from the video. Two different clinical quality assessment tasks in fetal ultrasound are considered in our experiments, i.e., measurement of the fetal head circumference and cerebellar diameter; in both of these, low-quality videos are detected by the large reconstruction error in the feature space. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the merits of our approach.

DE disinformation; deleted tweets; hate-speech; Arabic; social media
AB Social media platforms empower us in several ways, from information dissemination to consumption. While these platforms are useful in promoting citizen journalism, public awareness, etc., they have misuse potential. Malicious users use them to disseminate hate speech, offensive content, rumor, etc. to promote social and political agendas or to harm individuals, entities, and organizations. Oftentimes, general users unconsciously share information without verifying it or unintentionally post harmful messages. Some of such content often gets deleted either by the platform due to the violation of terms and policies or by users themselves for different reasons, e.g., regret. There is a wide range of studies in characterizing, understanding, and predicting deleted content. However, studies that aim to identify the fine-grained reasons (e.g., posts are offensive, hate speech, or no identifiable reason) behind deleted content are limited. In this study, we address an existing gap by identifying and categorizing deleted tweets, especially within the Arabic context. We label them based on fine-grained disinformation categories. We have curated a dataset of 40K tweets, annotated with both coarse and fine-grained labels. Following this, we designed models to predict the likelihood of tweets being deleted and to identify the potential reasons for their deletion. Our experiments, conducted using a variety of classic and transformer models, indicate that performance surpasses the majority baseline (e.g., 25% absolute improvement for fine-grained labels). We believe that such models can assist in moderating social media posts even before they are published.

AB Introduction: In the context of evolving societal preferences for deeper emotional connections in art, this paper explores the emergence of multimodal robot music performance art. It investigates the fusion of music and motion in robot performances to enhance expressiveness and emotional impact. The study employs Transformer models to combine audio and video signals, enabling robots to better understand music's rhythm, melody, and emotional content. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are utilized to create lifelike visual performances synchronized with music, bridging auditory and visual perception. Multimodal reinforcement learning is employed to achieve harmonious alignment between sound and motion.Methods: The study leverages Transformer models to process audio and video signals in robot performances. Generative Adversarial Networks are employed to generate visually appealing performances that align with the musical input. Multimodal reinforcement learning is used to synchronize robot actions with music. Diverse music styles and emotions are considered in the experiments. Performance evaluation metrics include accuracy, recall rate, and F1 score.Results: The proposed approach yields promising results across various music styles and emotional contexts. Performance smoothness scores exceed 94 points, demonstrating the fluidity of robot actions. An accuracy rate of 95% highlights the precision of the system in aligning robot actions with music. Notably, there is a substantial 33% enhancement in performance recall rate compared to baseline modules. The collective improvement in F1 score emphasizes the advantages of the proposed approach in the realm of robot music performance art.Discussion: The study's findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal robot music performance art in achieving heightened emotional impact. By combining audio and visual cues, robots can better interpret and respond to music, resulting in smoother and more precise performances. The substantial improvement in recall rate suggests that the proposed approach enhances the robots' ability to accurately mirror the emotional nuances of the music. These results signify the potential of this approach to transform the landscape of artistic expression through robotics, opening new avenues for emotionally resonant performances.

AB Logical reasoning task involves diverse types of complex reasoning over text, based on the form of multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Given the context, question and a set of options as the input, previous methods achieve superior performances on the full-data setting. However, the current benchmark dataset has the ideal assumption that the reasoning type distribution on the train split is close to the test split, which is inconsistent with many real application scenarios. To address it, there remain two problems to be studied: 1) how is the zero-shot capability of the models (train on seen types and test on unseen types)? and 2) how to enhance the perception of reasoning types for the models? For problem 1, we propose a new benchmark for generalized zero-shot logical reasoning, named ZsLR. It includes six splits based on the three type sampling strategies. For problem 2, a type-aware model TaCo is proposed. It utilizes the heuristic input reconstruction and builds a text graph with a global node. Incorporating graph reasoning and contrastive learning, TaCo can improve the type perception in the global representation. Extensive experiments on both the zero-shot and full-data settings prove the superiority of TaCo over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Also, we experiment and verify the generalization capability of TaCo on other logical reasoning dataset.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION
AB Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) analyze internet activities and traffic to detect potential attacks, thereby safeguarding computer systems. In this study, researchers focused on developing an advanced IDS that achieves high accuracy through the application of feature selection and ensemble learning methods. The utilization of the CIC-CSE-IDS2018 dataset for training and testing purposes adds relevance to the study. The study comprised two key stages, each contributing to its significance. In the first stage, the researchers reduced the dataset through strategic feature selection and carefully selected algorithms for ensemble learning. This process optimizes the IDS's performance by selecting the most informative features and leveraging the strengths of different classifiers. In the second stage, the ensemble learning approach was implemented, resulting in a powerful model that combines the benefits of multiple algorithms. The results of the study demonstrate its impact on improving attack detection and reducing detection time. By applying techniques such as Spearman's correlation analysis, recursive feature elimination (RFE), and chi-square test methods, the researchers identified key features that enhance the IDS's performance. Furthermore, the comparison of different classifiers showcased the effectiveness of models such as extra trees, decision trees, and logistic regression. These models not only achieved high accuracy rates but also considered the practical aspect of execution time. The study's overall significance lies in its contribution to advancing IDS capabilities and improving computer security. By adopting an ensemble learning approach and carefully selecting features and classifiers, the researchers created a model that outperforms individual classifier approaches. This model, with its high accuracy rate, further validates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in enhancing IDS performance. The findings of this study have the potential to drive future developments in intrusion detection systems and have a tangible impact on ensuring robust computer security in various domains.

AB In recent years, the escalating prevalence of elevated consumption and carbon emissions within urban operations has reached a disconcerting extent. This surge in resource depletion and environmental pollution exerts an adverse influence on the well-being of individuals, while impeding societal progress and hindering the enhancement of overall quality of life. Within the domain of urban environmental design, the integration of visual displays emerges as a superior approach to facilitate the assimilation and analysis of green and low-carbon information. However, urban environmental data usually contains multiple dimensions, so it is a problem to realize the data representation of multiple dimensions while maintaining the correlation and interactivity between data. To surmount the challenge of visualizing such intricate information, this investigation initially employs a sophisticated memory-based clustering algorithm for information extraction, accompanied by a global similarity algorithm that meticulously computes attribute component quantities within specific dimensions of the vector. Furthermore, leveraging the inherent power of Vue's bidirectional data binding capabilities, the study adopts the esteemed MVVM (Model-View-View-Model) pattern, fostering seamless two-way interaction through the established logical relationship. As a result, the amalgamation of multidimensional visualization technology empowers comprehensive data mining through a captivating visual augmentation. Concurrently, the application of data visualization dimension control delivers tailored displays tailored to green and low carbon scenarios within urban environmental design. Experimental results impeccably validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, substantiated by a mere 1.77% false alarm rate for data stream difference detection and a clustering difference of 1.34%. The aforementioned algorithm accentuates the efficacy of visual displays, thus engendering a profound synergy between the industrial and supply chains. Moreover, it facilitates the design, production, and utilization of environmentally friendly products and energy sources. This, in turn, serves as a catalyst, propelling the widescale adoption of green and low-carbon practices throughout the entire industrial chain, fueled by the seamless integration of multimedia data.

AB Mobile Health (mHealth) applications play an essential role in healthcare. The usage of mHealth apps is rapidly increasing, and it provides services, such as vitals, medication, and appointments, to patients and physicians. These apps significantly ease for patients to manage their health. Using sensitive health information and communication channels by mHealth apps has potential privacy and security hazards for patient's privacy and security. mHealth apps are primarily dependent on a remote server online. Someone can monitor, alter, and divert communication through public infrastructure. Many mHealth applications did not utilize any encryption method for client-server communication, making it an imminent risk for patients' data security and privacy. In this study, we proposed a framework to develop the mHealth application and apply the security parameters to reduce the risk of data breaches, such as data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Also, the study aims to identify the transport layer security issues relevant to the client-server of mHealth apps. To test the health data subset of Android and iOS apps collected from their Play Store and evaluate client security by the Charles Proxy tool. At the end of the paper, we presented the principal results of how many apps have vulnerabilities concerned with transport security. We compared our results for the transport layer of SSL and TLS certificates and chipper suit strength to show the performance of our proposed framework.

AB This paper suggests day-ahead scheduling of microgrid with and without demand side management considering hydrogen storage and plug-in electric vehicles. This is a highly constrained mixed integer nonlinear programming problem which is solved by using quasi-oppositional fast convergence evolutionary programming (QOFCEP) technique. The concept of the quasi-opposition-based learning is incorporated in fast convergence evolutionary programming (FCEP) to improve the efficiency and quality of the solution. QOFCEP employs quasi-oppositional based learning (QOBL) for population initialization and generation jumping. The studied microgrid comprises three diesel generators, one mini-hydro power plant, two wind turbine generators, two solar PV plants, one hydrogen storage system and plug-in electric vehicles. Simulation outcomes of the suggested QOFCEP technique have been compared with those obtained by FCEP and differential evolution (DE). It is seen from numerical results that the cost obtained with DSM is about 0.81% lower than the cost obtained without DSM. It is also seen that the cost obtained from QOFCEP is about 0.52% and 0.78% lower than the cost obtained from FCEP and DE, respectively. The suggested QOFCEP technique has the ability to bestow superior-quality solution.

ID MODELS
AB The application of digital technologies to facilitate farming activities has been on the rise in recent years. Among different tasks, the classification of weeds is a prerequisite for smart farming, and various techniques have been proposed to automatically detect weeds from images. However, many studies deal with weed images collected in the laboratory settings, and this might not be applicable to real-world scenarios. In this sense, there is still the need for robust classification systems that can be deployed in the field. In this work, we propose a practical solution to recognition of weeds exploiting two versions of EfficientNet as the recommendation engine. More importantly, to make the learning more effective, we also utilize different transfer learning strategies. The final aim is to build an expert system capable of accurately detecting weeds from lively captured images. We evaluate the approach's performance using DeepWeeds, a real-world dataset with 17,509 images. The experimental results show that the application of EfficientNet and transfer learning on the considered dataset substantially improves the overall prediction accuracy in various settings. Through the evaluation, we also demonstrate that the conceived tool outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. We expect that the proposed framework can be installed in robots to work on rice fields in Vietnam, allowing farmers to find and eliminate weeds in an automatic manner.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB With the rise of ready-to-assemble furniture, driven by international giants like IKEA, assembly services were increasingly offered by the same retailers. When planning orders with assembly services, the estimation of the service time leads to additional difficulties compared to standard delivery planning. Assembling large wardrobes or kitchens can take hours or even days while assembling a chair can be done in a few minutes. Combined with the usually vast amounts of offered products, a lot of knowledge is required to plan efficient and exact delivery routes. This paper shows how an artificial neural network (ANN) can be used to accurately predict the service time of a delivery based on factors such as the goods to be delivered or the personnel providing the service. The data used include not only deliveries with assembly of furniture, but also deliveries of goods without assembly and delivery of goods requiring electrical installation. The goal is to create a solution that can predict the time needed based on criteria such the type of furniture, the weight of the goods, and the experiences of the service technicians. The findings show that ANNs can be applied to this scenario and outperform more classical approaches, such as multiple linear regression or support vector machines. Still existing problems are largely due to the provided data, e.g., a large difference between the number of short and longer duration orders, which made it harder to accurately predict orders with longer duration.

ID CANCER; INFORMATION; NETWORK
AB Radiotherapy is one of the leading treatments for cancer. To accelerate the implementation of radiotherapy in clinic, various deep learning-based methods have been developed for automatic dose prediction. However, the effectiveness of these methods heavily relies on the availability of a substantial amount of data with labels, i.e. the dose distribution maps, which cost dosimetrists considerable time and effort to acquire. For cancers of low-incidence, such as cervical cancer, it is often a luxury to collect an adequate amount of labeled data to train a well-performing deep learning (DL) model. To mitigate this problem, in this paper, we resort to the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategy to achieve accurate dose prediction for cervical cancer (target domain) by leveraging the well-labeled high-incidence rectal cancer (source domain). Specifically, we introduce the cross-attention mechanism to learn the domain-invariant features and develop a cross-attention transformer-based encoder to align the two different cancer domains. Meanwhile, to preserve the target-specific knowledge, we employ multiple domain classiffers to enforce the network to extract more discriminative target features. In addition, we employ two independent convolutional neural network (CNN) decoders to compensate for the lack of spatial inductive bias in the pure transformer and generate accurate dose maps for both domains. Further-more, to enhance the performance, two additional losses, i.e. a knowledge distillation loss (KDL) and a domain classification loss (DCL), are incorporated to transfer the domain-invariant features while preserving domain specific information. Experimental results on a rectal cancer dataset and a cervical cancer dataset have demonstrated that our method achieves the best quantitative results with Delta D-98, Delta D-95, and HI of 1.446, 1.231, and 0.082, respectively, and outperforms other methods in terms of qualitative assessment.

AB With the advancement of smart mines, the need for gesture recognition for remote interaction between underground workers and machines has become crucial. However, traditional gesture recognition techniques require complex models that are very difficult to be deployed to the edge. To address this challenge, a gesture recognition method based on knowledge distillation is proposed in this study. First, the CSI ratio model is used to eliminate phase error and environmental noise, followed by the application of discrete wavelet transform to eliminate hardware noise interference. Then, the processed data is adaptively segmented using the principal component analysis and local anomaly factor algorithm to eliminate redundant static components. After that the processed CSI data is transformed into images using the relative position matrix method. Finally, knowledge distillation is employed to migrate knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, reducing the number of model parameters. Experiments conducted on the proposed method showed that it can achieve a recognition accuracy of 94.2% for hand gesture detection, which meets the requirement for gesture recognition in the mining industry.

AB The bargaining problem deals with the question of how far a negotiating agent should concede to its opponent. Classical solutions to this problem, such as the Nash bargaining solution (NBS), are based on the assumption that the set of possible negotiation outcomes forms a continuous space. Recently, however, we proposed a new solution to this problem for scenarios with finite offer spaces de Jonge and Zhang (Auton Agents Multi-Agent Syst 34(1):1-41, 2020). Our idea was to model the bargaining problem as a normal-form game, which we called the concession game, and then pick one of its Nash equilibria as the solution. Unfortunately, however, this game in general has multiple Nash equilibria and it was not clear which of them should be picked. In this paper we fill this gap by defining a new solution to the general problem of how to choose between multiple Nash equilibria, for arbitrary 2-player normal-form games. This solution is based on the assumption that the agent will play either 'side' of the game (i.e. as row-player or as column-player) equally often, or with equal probability. We then apply this to the concession game, which ties up the loose ends of our previous work and results in a proper, well-defined, solution to the bargaining problem. The striking conclusion, is that for rational and purely self-interested agents, in most cases the optimal strategy is to agree to the deal that maximizes the sum of the agents' utilities and not the product of their utilities as the NBS prescribes.

AB Advance prediction of crop yield is very critical in the context of ensuring food security as the region specific challenges in social and environmental conditions often infringe plan of policy makers. This study presents a generic methodology to configure and fine tune the state-of-the-art Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Learning (DL) model through hyperparameter optimization for prediction of yield (annual crop production) in Wheat, Groundnut and Barely over India based on multiple independent input variables identified using multicollinearity test. The Monte Carlo cross-validation method is used to validate the optimized LSTM models. Results from the LSTM model tuning showed that among the 4 optimizers tested, Adam was found to perform better irrespective of the crop and Bi-LSTM outperformed sLSTM in terms of prediction accuracy. The percentage reduction in error with Bi-LSTM compared to sLSTM in predicting wheat and groundnut crop yield was 39% and 13% respectively while in case of barley crop, error reduction was marginal (0.34%). The performance of optimized Bi-LSTM model is compared with the performance of traditional machine learning (ML) models such as support vector regression (SVR) and SVR polynomial {2nd and 3rd order}, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and ARIMAX (ARIMA with exogenous variables) and Vector Auto-regression (VAR). The Bi-LSTM model is found to be superior to ML models; the percentage reduction in mean absolute scaled error with the Bi-LSTM compared to the best performing ML model was 94%, 72%, and 71% in predicting wheat, groundnut and barley yield respectively. This study showed that by choosing proper explanatory (independent) variable and hyperparameter optimization, a simple (single layer) structure of deep neural network (LSTM) outperformed traditional ML models in terms of accuracy for crop yield prediction application.

Unlike other summarization tasks, Qf-MDS has specific research challenges including the differences and similarities across related document sets, the high degree of redundancy inherent in the summaries created from multiple related sources, relevance to the given query, topic diversity in the produced summary and the small source-to-summary compression ratio. In this work, we propose a semantic diversity feature based query-focused extractive summarizer (SDbQfSum) built on powerful text semantic representation techniques underpinned with Wikipedia commonsense knowledge in order to address the query-relevance, centrality, redundancy and diversity challenges. Specifically, a semantically parsed document text is combined with knowledge-based vectorial representation to extract effective sentence importance and query-relevance features. The proposed monolingual summarizer is evaluated on a standard English dataset for automatic query-focused summarization tasks, that is, the DUC2006 dataset. The obtained results show that our summarizer outperforms most state-of-the-art related approaches on one or more ROUGE measures achieving 0.418, 0.092 and 0.152 in ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-SU4 respectively. It also attains competitive performance with the slightly outperforming system(s), for example, the difference between our system's result and best system in ROUGE-1 is just 0.006. We also found through the conducted experiments that our proposed custom cluster merging algorithm significantly reduces information redundancy while maintaining topic diversity across documents.

AB A knowledge graph (KG) is a structured form of knowledge describing real-world entities, properties and relationships as a graph. Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGQA) allows people to ask questions in natural language and extract answers from KG accurately and more quickly. The main task of a KGQA is to convert a natural language query to the corresponding structured query form like SPARQL. However, generating the precise SPARQL query from a question is challenging and highly error-prone. Here we propose a question-answering framework that uses KG to answer simple questions without using SPARQL. Question classification, dependency parsing, entity linking, BERT-based relation finding and answer extraction constitute the main modules of the approach. We have used the DBpedia as the KG and tested the end-to-end system with a subset of QALD-4, LC-QuAD and SimpleQuestions datasets. Results show considerable improvement compared to other approaches in terms of F1-score.

AB Protein and carbohydrate content in the diet of the predator Hippodamia variegata Goeze (variegated ladybug) directly influences reproduction fitness by affecting foraging efficiency. The effect of three varied qualities of Aphis gossypii Glover (cotton aphid) prey on daily H. variegata feeding and daily egg production (DEP) were estimated using the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM can predict predator reproductive behavior as a function of the relationship between foraging and prey nutritional composition. We used the total number and weight of aphids consumed, volume of protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and glycogen, and total energy received by the ladybug after feeding on one prey item as input variables. Aphid quality varied as nitrogen (N) fertilization levels were 110, 160, and 210 ppm on the Cucumis sativus L. (cucumber) host plants. The model estimated female beetles consumed more aphids and nutrients on C. sativus plants with N levels of 160 ppm compared to lower (110 ppm) N levels and had higher reproductive transformation efficiencies. Transformation rates of aphid feeding to egg production in females exposed to the 160 ppm treatment were 65% greater, had lower nutrient and energy requirements, and achieved a 29.4% higher DEP than those exposed to high (210 ppm) N levels. The SVM predicted nutrient compositions of A. gossypii exposed to 160 ppm N were balanced such that H. variegata exhibited greater reproduction efficiency than the other N treatments for first 30 d from the start of reproduction.

AB The increased volume of rumors and attention on related topics during the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant negative social impact. To combat rumors, it is crucial to study the actors involved in their spread. In this study, we first introduce prospect theory and construct an evolutionary game model between network operators and government regulators. We investigate collusion between network operators and Internet rumormongers as well as the regulatory behavior of government agencies. Second, we use prospect value to replace traditional expected utility to construct a profit prospect matrix and apply the dynamic replicator equation to analyze the equilibrium stability of the model. The stability conditions of the game between the two parties are closely related to the government's regulatory costs, and the strength of government punishment after collusion is detected. Finally, we propose relevant countermeasures against collusion problems during the network rumor control period.

AB In this paper, we extend the concept of a randomized quantile residual to multinomial regression models. Customary diagnostics for these models are limited because they involve difficult-to-interpret residuals and often focus on the fit of one category versus the rest. Our residuals account for associations between categories by using the squared Mahalanobis distances of the observed log-odds relative to their fitted sampling distributions. Aside from sampling variation, these residuals are exactly normal when the data come from the fitted model. This motivates our use of the residuals to detect model misspecification and overdispersion, in addition to an overall goodness-of-fit Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate the use of the residuals and diagnostics in both simulation and real data studies.

AB In this study, we primarily aim to address the exposure bias issue in long text generation intrinsic to statistical language models. We propose a sentence-level heuristic tree search algorithm, specially tailored for long text generation, to mitigate the problem by managing generated texts in a tree structure and curbing the compounding of biases. Our algorithm utilizes two pre-trained language models, an auto-regressive model for generating new sentences and an auto-encoder model for evaluating sentence quality. These models work in tandem to perform four critical operations: expanding the text tree with new sentences, evaluating the quality of the additions, sampling potential unfinished text fragments for further generation, and pruning leaf nodes deemed unpromising. This iterative process continues until a pre-defined number of [EOS] tokens are produced, at which point we select the highest-scoring completed text as our final output. Moreover, we pioneer two novel token-level decoding techniques-nucleus sampling with temperature and diverse beam search with sampling. These methods, integrated with our sentence-level search algorithm, aim to improve the consistency and diversity of text generation. Experimental results, both automated measures (including Jaccard similarity, Word2vec similarity, and unique word ratio) and human evaluations (assessing consistency, fluency, and rhetorical skills), conclusively demonstrate that our approach considerably enhances the quality of machine-generated long-form text. Through this research, we aim to inspire further innovations in sentence-level search-based text generation algorithms.

ID DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; K-MEANS; HOMOLOGY; PCA
AB We discuss topological aspects of cluster analysis and show that inferring the topological structure of a dataset before clustering it can considerably enhance cluster detection: we show that clustering embedding vectors representing the inherent structure of a dataset instead of the observed feature vectors themselves is highly beneficial. To demonstrate, we combine manifold learning method UMAP for inferring the topological structure with density-based clustering method DBSCAN. Synthetic and real data results show that this both simplifies and improves clustering in a diverse set of low- and high-dimensional problems including clusters of varying density and/or entangled shapes. Our approach simplifies clustering because topological pre-processing consistently reduces parameter sensitivity of DBSCAN. Clustering the resulting embeddings with DBSCAN can then even outperform complex methods such as SPECTACL and ClusterGAN. Finally, our investigation suggests that the crucial issue in clustering does not appear to be the nominal dimension of the data or how many irrelevant features it contains, but rather how separable the clusters are in the ambient observation space they are embedded in, which is usually the (high-dimensional) Euclidean space defined by the features of the data. The approach is successful because it performs the cluster analysis after projecting the data into a more suitable space that is optimized for separability, in some sense.

AB Clinical notes contain valuable patient information. These notes are written by health care providers with various scientific levels and writing styles. It might be helpful for clinicians and researchers to understand what information is essential when dealing with extensive electronic medical records. Entities recognizing them and mapping them to standard terminologies is crucial to reducing ambiguity in processing clinical notes. Although named entity recognition and entity linking are critical steps in clinical natural language processing, they can produce repetitive and low-value concepts. On the other hand, all parts of a clinical text do not share the same importance or content in predicting the patient's condition. As a result, it is necessary to identify the section in which each content item is recorded and critical concepts to extract meaning from clinical texts. In this study, these challenges have been addressed by using clinical natural language processing techniques. In addition, a set of unsupervised essential phrase extraction methods has been verified and evaluated to identify key concepts. Considering that most clinical concepts are in the form of multi-word expressions and their accurate identification requires the user to specify an n-gram range, we have proposed a shortcut method to preserve the structure of the term based on TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency). To evaluate, we have designed two types of downstream tasks (multiple and binary classification) using the capabilities of transformer-based models. The results show the proposed method's superiority in combination with the SciBERT model. Also, they offer an insight into the efficacy of general methods for extracting essential phrases from clinical notes.

AB Sequence generation models are increasingly being used to translate natural language into programs, i.e., to perform executable semantic parsing. The fact that semantic parsing aims to predict programs that can lead to executed actions in the real world motivates developing safe systems. This in turn makes measuring calibration-a central component to safety-particularly important. We investigate the calibration of popular generation models across four popular semantic parsing datasets, finding that it varies across models and datasets. We then analyze factors associated with calibration error and release new confidence-based challenge splits of two parsing datasets. To facilitate the inclusion of calibration in semantic parsing evaluations, we release a library for computing calibration metrics.1

TI Intent-calibrated Self-training for Answer Selection in Open-domain
   Dialogues

DT Article
AB Answer selection in open-domain dialogues aims to select an accurate answer from candidates. The recent success of answer selection models hinges on training with large amounts of labeled data. However, collecting large-scale labeled data is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce the predicted intent labels to calibrate answer labels in a self-training paradigm. Specifically, we propose intent-calibrated self-training (ICAST) to improve the quality of pseudo answer labels through the intent-calibrated answer selection paradigm, in which we employ pseudo intent labels to help improve pseudo answer labels. We carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets with open-domain dialogues. The experimental results show that ICAST outperforms baselines consistently with 1%, 5%, and 10% labeled data. Specifically, it improves 2.06% and 1.00% of F1 score on the two datasets, compared with the strongest baseline with only 5% labeled data.

AB Local strategies, which are based on cost minimization, to achieve circular formations of autonomous robot groups are presented. It is assumed that the group members have no communication capabilities or any means of interchanging information among themselves, and that they can only rely on their sensors, which provide relative positions of their nearby group members. It is verified on simulations that via appropriately defined cost functions arc, arc-triangle and circle formations are obtained, which can be maintained during navigation.

AB The sequential interaction network usually find itself in a variety of applications, e.g., recommender system. Herein, inferring future interaction is of fundamental importance, and previous efforts are mainly focused on the dynamics in the classic zero-curvature Euclidean space. Despite the promising results achieved by previous methods, a range of significant issues still largely remains open: On the bipartite nature, is it appropriate to place user and item nodes in one identical space regardless of their inherent difference? On the network dynamics, instead of a fixed curvature space, will the representation spaces evolve when new interactions arrive continuously? On the learning paradigm, can we get rid of the label information costly to acquire? To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel Contrastive model for Sequential Interaction Network learning on Co-Evolving RiEmannian spaces, CSincere. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a couple of co-evolving representation spaces, rather than a single or static space, and propose a co-contrastive learning for the sequential interaction network. In CSincere, we formulate a Cross-Space Aggregation for message-passing across representation spaces of different Riemannian geometries, and design a Neural Curvature Estimator based on Ricci curvatures for modeling the space evolvement over time. Thereafter, we present a Reweighed Co-Contrast between the temporal views of the sequential network, so that the couple of Riemannian spaces interact with each other for the interaction prediction without labels. Empirical results on 5 public datasets show the superiority of CSincere over the state-of-the-art methods.

ID DIFFUSION
AB Existing self-representation models based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have gained widespread attention for their outstanding clustering performance in subspace clustering. However, when images contain rich spatial information, the use of fully connected neural networks that only accept vector inputs results in a significant loss of spatial information, thereby greatly reducing the clustering performance of the models. To address the clustering problem of data with rich spatial information, this paper proposes a multichannel subspace clustering method based on a self-representation network (CGSNet). This method incorporates modules capable of mining spatial features into the self-representation network to highlight different data characteristics and supplement the spatial information lost by the MLP. CGSNet successfully uncovers the latent features within the input data samples and extracts the spatial relationships among different image features by employing channel and spatial attention modules. Additionally, static parameterized channel mapping and spatial mapping are used to refine and filter the obtained spatial information, further enhancing the quality of self-representation. Finally, by leveraging the self-representation network, the clustering task is completed by learning the affinity matrix. The experimental results demonstrate that CGSNet outperforms the self-expressive network (SENet), achieving improvements of 1.5%, 3.3%, 0.9%, and 4.4% in terms of the clustering accuracy with the MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and EMNIST datasets, respectively. CGSNet achieves the highest accuracy among competitive clustering methods, including EnSC, SENet, and 14 others.

AB Practice is an essential means by which humans and animals engage in cognitive activities. Intelligent tutoring systems, with a crucial component of modelling learners' cognitive processes during learning and optimizing their learning strategies, offer an excellent platform to investigate students' practice-based cognitive processes. In related studies, modelling methods for cognitive processes have demonstrated commendable performance. Furthermore, researchers have extended their investigations using decision-theoretic approaches, such as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), to induce learning strategies by modelling the students' cognitive processes. However, the existing research has primarily centered around the modelling of macro-level instructional behaviors rather than the specific practice selection made by the students within the intricate realms of cognitive domains. In this paper, we adapt the POMDP model to represent relations between the student's performance on cognitive tasks and his/her cognitive states. By doing so, we can predict his/her performance while inducing learning strategies. More specifically, we focus on question selection during the student's real-time learning activities in an intelligent tutoring system. To address the challenges on modelling complex cognitive domains, we exploit the question types to automate parameter learning and subsequently employ information entropy techniques to refine learning strategies in the POMDP. We conduct the experiments in two real-world knowledge concept learning domains. The experimental results show that the performance of the learning strategies induced by our new model is superior to that of other learning strategies. Moreover, the new model has good reliability in predicting the student's performance. Utilizing an intelligent tutoring system as the research platform, this article addresses the modelling and strategy induction challenges of practice-based cognitive processes with intricate structures, aiming to tutor students effectively. Our work provides a new approach of predicting the students' performance as well as personalizing their learning strategies.

SO COGNITIVE COMPUTATION AND SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks
AB The authors present the investigation of a new hybrid predictive model of Duplex Attention-based Coupled LSTM Markov Averaged Neural Network, known as DACLMANN. The financial field, particularly the stock market, heavily relies on accurate predictive models. DACLMANN comprises four essential components: two LSTM blocks, an Averagiser and a Markov Neural Network block. The first LSTM block is composed of two hidden layers, each containing 50 neurons and a dense layer with 25 neurons. The second LSTM block consists of two hidden layers, each with 100 neurons, and a dense layer with 50 neurons. The Averagiser plays a crucial role by averaging the closing prices and predicted values from the first LSTM block, resulting in a 90% gain. These averaged values are then fed into the second LSTM block for further prediction. Finally, the predictions undergo evaluation using the Markov model, yielding the final prediction. To assess the performance of DACLMANN, it was tested on 22 years of stock prices for the AMZN index. The evaluation metrics used by the authors include an R2 of 0.76, mean absolute error of 6.81216, root mean square error of 8.6040, Precision of 1, Accuracy of 1, Recall of 1 and F1 of 1. Additionally, DACLMANN achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of less than 0.043% and an RMSPE of less than 2.1%. These results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also authenticate the prediction outcomes. DACLMANN offers several advantages over traditional predictive models in the stock market. By combining the strengths of Duplex Attention-based Coupled LSTM, Averagiser, and Markov Neural Network, DACLMANN leverages the power of deep learning, attention mechanisms, and sequential modelling. This hybrid approach enables DACLMANN to capture intricate patterns and dependencies present in stock market data, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions. The robust evaluation metrics further validate the superiority of DACLMANN in predicting stock prices.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there are differences in handwritten Chinese signatures on different media including paper and electronic devices. Participants were asked to sign specified names on various types of media and the signatures were scanned or saved digitally for subsequent analysis. In this study, using convolutional neural networks and Siamese neural networks as classifiers and comparators, the performance plunge is revealed and thus considerable dissimilarity between the signatures on different media is implied. To further explore this, cubic Bezier curves are fitted to the signatures using the least square method for quantitative statistical analysis. By analyzing the visual changes in the morphology of strokes, several features of signatures are selected and computed, and the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test are implemented, which provides a deeper substantiation and explanation of the findings.
   Telecommuting and online commerce have led to the widespread adoption of electronic signatures under diverse contexts. Herein, a substantial dataset of cross-media Chinese signatures with control group is collected. Furthermore, claims of similarity are denied by comparing convolutional neural network performance, and subsequently distinctions are delineated through quantitative models and rigorous statistical tests.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Robots that incorporate the function of apologizing have emerged in recent years. This paper examines the moral permissibility of making robots apologize. First, I characterize the nature of apology based on analyses conducted in multiple scholarly domains. Next, I present a prima facie argument that robot apologies are not permissible because they may harm human societies by inducing the misattribution of responsibility. Subsequently, I respond to a possible response to the prima facie objection based on the interpretation that attributing responsibility to a robot is analogous to having an attitude toward fiction. Then, I demonstrate that there are cases of robot apologies where the prima facie objection does not apply, by considering the following two points: (1) apology-related practices found in our human-to-human apologies, and (2) a difference in the degree of harm caused by robot failures and the resulting apologies. Finally, given the current norms governing our apology-related practices, I argue that some instances of making robots apologize are permissible, and I propose conducting critical robotics research questioning the validity of such norms.

AB We propose a simple, statistically principled, and theoretically justified method to improve supervised learning when the training set is not representative, a situation known as covariate shift. We build upon a well-established methodology in causal inference and show that the effects of covariate shift can be reduced or eliminated by conditioning on propensity scores. In practice, this is achieved by fitting learners within strata constructed by partitioning the data based on the estimated propensity scores, leading to approximately balanced covariates and much-improved target prediction. We refer to the overall method as Stratified Learning, or StratLearn. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this general-purpose method on two contemporary research questions in cosmology, outperforming state-of-the-art importance weighting methods. We obtain the best-reported AUC (0.958) on the updated "Supernovae photometric classification challenge," and we improve upon existing conditional density estimation of galaxy redshift from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data.

AB This article proposes utilizing a single deep reinforcement learning model to solve combinatorial multiobjective optimization problems. We use the well-known multiobjective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP) as an example. Our proposed method employs an encoder-decoder framework to learn the mapping from the MOTSP instance to its Paretooptimal set. Specifically, it leverages a novel routing encoder to extract information for both the entire multiobjective aspect and every individual objective from the MOTSP instance. The global embeddings and each objective's embeddings are adaptively aggregated via a routing network to form the subproblems' embedding that can well represent the MOTSP features. Using a modified context embedding, the subproblems' embeddings are fed into a decoder to produce a set of approximate Paretooptimal solutions in parallel. Additionally, we develop a Top-k baseline to enable more efficient data utilization and lightweight training for our proposed method. We compare our method with heuristic-based and learning-based ones on various types of MOTSP instances, and the experimental results show that our method can solve MOTSP instances in real-time and outperform the other algorithms, especially on large-scale problem instances.

AB Volatility and uncertainty of today's value chains along with the market's demands for low-batch customized products mandate production systems to become smarter and more resilient, dynamically and even autonomously adapting to both external and internal disturbances. Such resilient behavior can be partially enabled by highly interconnected Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) incorporating advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Multi-agent solutions can provide better planning and control, improving flexibility and responsiveness in production systems. Small modular parts can autonomously take intelligent decisions and react to local events. The main goal of decentralization and interconnectivity is to enable autonomous and cooperative decision-making. Nevertheless, a more efficient orchestration of various AI components and deeper human integration are required. In addition, global behaviors of coalitions of autonomous agents are not easily comprehensible by workers. Furthermore, it is challenging to implement an Industry 4.0 paradigm where a human should be in charge of decision-making and execution. This paper discusses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) where several software agents cooperate with smart workers to enable a dynamic and reconfigurable production paradigm. Asset Administration Shell (AAS) submodels hold smart workers' descriptions in machine-readable format, serving as an integration layer between various system's components. The self-description capability of the AAS supports the system's adaptability and self-configuration. The proposed concept supports the plug-and-produce functionality of the production modules and improves human-machine integration in the shared assembly tasks.

DE Distantly supervised learning; Information extraction; Relation
   extraction; Contrastive learning
AB Distantly supervised relation extraction is an automatically annotating method for large corpora by classifying a bound of sentences with two same entities and the relation. Recent works exploit sound performance by adopting contrastive learning to efficiently obtain instance representations under the multi-instance learning framework. Though these methods weaken the impact of noisy labels, it ignores the long-tail distribution problem in distantly supervised sets and fails to capture the mutual information of different parts. We are thus motivated to tackle these issues and establishing a long-tail awareness contrastive learning method for efficiently utilizing the long-tail data. Our model treats major and tail parts differently by adopting hyper-augmentation strategies. Moreover, the model provides various views by constructing novel positive and negative pairs in contrastive learning for gaining a better representation between different parts. The experimental results on the NYT10 dataset demonstrate our model surpasses the existing SOTA by more than 2.61% AUC score on relation extraction. In manual evaluation datasets including NYT10m and Wiki20m, our method obtains competitive results by achieving 59.42% and 79.19% AUC scores on relation extraction, respectively. Extensive discussions further confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is developing into one of the most important non-invasive tools for clinical brain research. This development is supported by a project funded by the German Research Foundation, in which four major obstacles related to dMRI data were addressed: (1) the lack of transferability of dMRI data between clinical sites, (2) the lack of training and label data, (3) the potential of complex diffusion data, and (4) the integration of spherical signals in neural networks to improve accuracy. To overcome the problem of different MRI systems producing slightly varying data, the project developed a method for harmonizing MRI signals. To address the issue of limited ground truth data, a framework was developed to synthesize individual diffusion data and complete datasets based on important diffusion characteristics and statistics. The integration of complex signals, often discarded during acquisition, to improve reconstruction was also explored. Finally, new methods were developed to preserve the spherical character of the diffusion data in the DL model. The resulting methods are intended to improve the usability of diffusion imaging data and to enable the creation of processing pipelines for dMRI data in clinical studies and clinical practice.

AB This paper presents designs of fixed-time zeroing neural networks (FxZNNs) for solving time-variant convex optimization problems, especially arising from repetitive motion planning of redundant manipulators. Through introducing the transition state, the bound estimation for settling time of the FxZNN models with double power-rate activation functions is carried out, and it is shown that the computing accuracy improvement can be made dramatically, in comparison to the models with the transition state being one. Novel two-phase FxZNN models with the pre-specified transition state are designed and analyzed in detail. The closed-form settling time functions are presented for each given initial condition, and the upper bounds on settling time are established in the presence of arbitrary initial conditions. The semi-global FxZNNs are designed to take account of initial conditions within the region with a specified radius. In addition, the modified FxZNN models assure predefined-time convergence also in the semi-global sense. The theoretical results demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the transition state introduced in the activation functions. The proposed FxZNNs are applied and compared with the existing models for solving a time-variant optimization problem and the repetitive motion planning of a redundant manipulator with initial errors, and numerical results are presented to verify effectiveness of the proposed FxZNN models.

AB Understanding customer preferences and providing the right products at the right time to customers via personalized recommendations have been among the major interests of online retailers and service providers. This paper proposes an improved collaborative filtering model that incorporates a firm's marketing effort variables (i.e., media promotional variables) to improve the prediction of customers' digital music choices. In addition, we assert that the predictive model's effectiveness is different for consumers depending on their varietyseeking tendencies in music. We compared our predictive model to benchmark models and demonstrated that our proposed model is superior in predicting users' download behavior. We also found that the overall predictive performance is higher for active variety seekers who consume diverse types of music via streaming. We provide some evidence that this may be due to differences in the degree to which the two groups are influenced by different types of media promotions. The results suggest that considering psychological characteristics such as variety-seeking tendencies provides more advantages in prediction and recommendation systems, which opens new avenues for improvement.

AB Forecasting online product sales is essential for retailers and e-commerce platforms, but it can be challenging owing to the complex dynamics and mixed trends in sales data. Popular end-to-end approaches tend to capture spurious correlations in historical data, whereas two-stage approaches that decompose time series and make separate predictions often result in error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose PoissonGP, a novel Bayesian model that employs a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a Gaussian process prior for sales prediction. PoissonGP can capture complex patterns in data with multiple trends and manage distribution shifts caused by changes in long-run sales. Additionally, it incorporates forecast uncertainty and provides interpretability for building efficient and visual decision support systems. Experimental results on several synthetic and empirical datasets suggest that PoissonGP outperforms existing approaches, making it a promising tool for ecommerce platforms.

AB This theoretical research in fuzzy correlation analysis integrates data uncertainty analysis by measuring the strength of the linear relationship restricted to two fuzzy sets. As the relevant contribution to this research area, this paper presents the axiomatic definition of the n-dimensional generalized fuzzy correlation coefficient (nGCC), assigning to n input fuzzy sets an output value in the interval [-1,1]. Thus, the properties of general overlap functions and fuzzy negations are studied, discussing binary non-normed restricted dissimilarity functions, and the n-dimensional non-normed conjunctive functions. This study provides new methods for the n-dimensional generalized fuzzy correlation coefficient analysis, regarding their applications in solving multi-criteria and decision-making problems founded on fuzzy logic extensions. The n-dimensional non-normed conjunctive aggregation functions are also introduced, as range domain extensions from [0,1] to [-1.1], covering the interpretation of negative to positive variable associations. The proposal correlation analysis promotes a better evaluation and data selection even when more than one algorithm is applied to evaluate the reduction methods in the defuzzification process based on Interval-valued Fuzzy Logic. We also investigate the relevance to determine a reliable result from the fuzzy inference system based on the nGCC methodology. This correlation methodology applied to the Interval Fuzzy Load Balancing for Cloud Computing (Int-FLBCC) model contributes as a flexible approach for virtual machines dynamic consolidation enabling improvements in resource usage and power efficiency, improving the computational system's energy efficiency. So, the nGCC methodology extends the Int-FLBCC model by adding other degrees of reliability to the results obtained with diverse evaluations through n-dimensional generalized fuzzy correlation coefficient expressions, exploring average aggregations as arithmetic and exponential means and the median operator.

AB The inverse kinematics problem in articulated robots implies to obtain joint rotation angles using the robot end effector position and orientation tool. Unlike the problem of direct kinematics, in inverse kinematics there are no systematic methods for solving the problem. Moreover, solving the inverse kinematics problem is particularly complicated for certain morphologies of articulated robots. Machine learning techniques and, more specifically, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been proposed in the scientific literature to solve this problem. However, there are some limitations in the performance of ANNs. In this study, different techniques that involve ANNs are proposed and analyzed. The results show that the proposed original bootstrap sampling and hybrid methods can substantially improve the performance of approaches that use only one ANN. Although all of these improvements do not solve completely the inverse kinematics problem in articulated robots, they do lay the foundations for the design and development of future more effective and efficient controllers. Therefore, the source code and documentation of this research are also publicly available to practitioners interested in adapting and improving these methods to any industrial robot or articulated robot.

AB The carbody abnormal vibration has significant impacts on the comfort and safety of high-speed train. Field measurements were conducted to study the low-frequency swaying of the carbody on a high-speed train operating on a railway line. According to the test results, the tail vehicle of the train swayed laterally in various places along the line. The lateral stability index of vehicle clearly exceeded the limit value when the carbody swayed. The predominant frequency of the lateral acceleration of the carbody was between 1.4 and 1.5 Hz. Through the simulation of computational fluid dynamics, it is confirmed that the yaw moment and lift force of the tail vehicle are greater than those of the middle and the head vehicles. Furthermore, the dynamics simulation show that aerodynamics disturbances may be the intensified cause of the abnormal swaying of the tail vehicle. Therefore, the study proposes the installation of inter-vehicle dampers. and optimizes the damping values of dampers based on GA-BP optimization algorithm, so as to weaken the abnormal swaying motion. The relevant simulation results offer a solution to address the abnormal swaying phenomenon in practical situations.

AB Medical Vision-and-Language Pre-training (MedVLP), which learns generic vision-language representations from medical images and texts to benefit various downstream medical tasks, has drawn remarkable attention in both artificial intelligence and clinical medicine. However, existing works ignore the privacy issues and the heavy computation burden in MedVLP. In this study, we propose a FedMedVLP model, which adopts federated learning to unify the datasets from different clients, e.g., centers and hospitals, to form a largescale pre-training dataset. As a result, the unified large-scale pre-training dataset can be used to pre-train the MedVLP to achieve strong performance. Overall, our FedMedVLP can improve the performance of MedVLP while preventing data leakage. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed model sets new state-of-the-art results on five benchmark datasets across three medical mainstream tasks, i.e., medical image-text retrieval, medical text-image retrieval, and medical visual question answering tasks. Besides, we further evaluate our method on our curated well-balanced medical dataset COVID-Fed.

AB Video data are witnessing exponential growth, and extracting summarized information is challenging. It is always necessary to reduce the load of video traffic for the efficient video storage, transmission, and retrieval requirements. The aim of video summarization (VS) is to extract the most important contents from video repositories effectively. Recent attempts have used fewer representative features, which have been fed to recurrent networks to achieve VS. However, generating the desired summaries can become challenging due to the limited representativeness of extracted features and a lack of consideration for feature refinement. In this article, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)-assisted deep pyramidal refinement network that can extract and refine multi-scale features and can predict an importance score for each frame. The proposed network comprises four main modules; initially, a dense prediction transformer with a ViT backbone is applied for the first time in this domain to acquire the optimal representations from the input frames. Then, feature maps are obtained from various layers separately and processed individually to support multi-scale progressive feature fusion and refinement before the data are passed to the ultimate prediction module. Next, a customized pyramidal refinement block is employed to refine the multi-level feature set before predicting the importance scores. Finally, video summaries are produced by selecting keyframes based on the predictions. To explore the performance of the proposed network, extensive experiments are conducted on the TVSum and SumMe datasets, and our network is found to achieve F1-scores of 62.4% and 51.9%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives by 0.9% and 0.5%.

AB As electric vehicles (EVs) continue to grow in popularity, the demand for efficient and effective EV charging infrastructure is rapidly increasing. However, the design and deployment of such infrastructure faces numerous challenges, some of which include demand uncertainty, EV network layout, maintenance cost, and quality of service (QoS), and have proven to be particularly challenging in cases where all objectives need to be addressed simultaneously. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hierarchical iterative optimization approach that aims to minimize the demand-supply mismatch at a higher level and considers both cost and QoS under uncertainty at a lower level in a dynamic EV charging network. Specifically, the proposed approach uses a time-series linear regression ensemble to accurately predict future demand at demand points, which is then used to match demand at demand points with supply at supply points. We then model the infrastructure allocation problem as a knapsack problem and use an allocation algorithm to determine the optimal number of charging stations at each supply point. The infrastructure is allocated to minimize total cost and maximize QoS. A framework for EV infrastructure optimization is designed and can be applied to any type of network. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experimentation on various datasets by comparing with existing state-of-the-art approaches. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is robust to different EV networks, handles uncertainty well, can effectively address the challenges associated with EV infrastructure optimization, and can provide policy makers and infrastructure planners with a practical and efficient tool for designing and deploying charging infrastructure. This study contributes to the field of EV infrastructure network optimization by modeling QoS and proposing a hierarchical optimization framework that effectively addresses the challenges associated with the design and deployment of charging infrastructure.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Disinformation created by artificial neural networks has been widespread along with the recent rapid progress in multimodal learning, and the arising of vision-language foundation models. This disinformation caused a substantial negative impact on society. To solve this pressing issue, numerous efforts have been made to detect either image deepfake or text manipulation. These methods generally focus on a single modality while ignoring the complementary knowledge provided by the counterpart in the other modalities. In this paper, we aim to detect multimodal disinformation and further identify manipulated image areas or text tokens. To this aim, a novel framework termed Vision-language Knowledge Interaction (ViKI) is designed to explore the semantic correlation of an object in different modalities. Specifically, we propose a vision-language embedding regulator to build a joint feature space in which the embeddings of the same semantic are well-aligned. Besides, we perform cross-modality knowledge interaction so as to aggregate uni-modality embedding by adaptively injecting cross-modality information. By exploring vision-language knowledge jointly, ViKI produces accurate predictions for detecting and grounding disinformation. We demonstrate the superiority of ViKI by ablation studies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmarks. Notably, ViKI outperforms the state-of-the-art works by a rise of 3.71% in precision and 2.14% in CF1 respectively.

AB Cyber-physical-social systems refer to new systems that involve a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices connected through an interconnected network. These systems gather data for various services such as transportation, energy, healthcare, etc. This data is then transmitted to the cloud layer for storage, processing, and access. To handle the significant workload offloaded from resource-constrained IoT devices without latency or bandwidth issues, a technology called fog computing has emerged as an intermediary layer between the cloud and IoT devices. The quality of service (QoS) provided by fog computing relies on efficient task scheduling to optimize energy consumption and maximum execution time. This task scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard and cannot be solved with high precision in a reasonable time using traditional techniques or existing metaheuristic-based task schedulers. Therefore, this study proposes a new multi-objective task scheduling approach based on a modified marine predators algorithm (MMPA) to simultaneously minimize energy consumption and make-span under the Pareto optimality theory. This variant is named the multi-objective MMPA (M2MPA). M2MPA enhances the performance of the MPA by incorporating the polynomial crossover operator to improve its exploration operator and the adaptive CF parameter to enhance its exploitation operator. The effectiveness of M2MPA is evaluated using eighteen tasks with different scales (small, large, and medium) and heterogeneous workloads assigned to two hundred fog devices with varying processing speeds. Finally, M2MPA is compared with six well-established techniques using various performance indicators, including carbon dioxide emission rate, flowtime, make-span, and energy consumption. The experimental findings demonstrate the substantial superiority of M2MPA over all competing algorithms across different performance indicators and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Quantitatively, M2MPA achieves an average make-span of 10.095, average energy consumption of 3.77E+06, average flowtime of 8.39E+03, and average carbon dioxide emission rate of 8.88E+06.

ID SMALL-TARGET DETECTION; LOCAL CONTRAST METHOD
AB Infrared small object detection plays an important role in maritime surveillance, early warning systems, and precise positioning. However, existing deep learning methods lack attention to local information and overlook the interactivity between local and global information. To solve this problem and explore a more effective feature extraction network for infrared small object detection, we propose an information interactivity attention network (IIANet), which decouples the optimization of miss detection and false alarm by adversarial learning. Specifically, the information interactivity attention is achieved by the combination of the global spatial attention module and pixel-wise local attention module where they can complement each other to generate finer attention. Correspondingly, to make full use of the extracted interactive features, a more sophisticated information aggregation discriminator is designed by using the intensive skip-addition module which further realizes information communication among different semantic information. Finally, we apply the pixel equalization strategy to further promote the learning ability of the data-oriented model by enhancing the visual contrast between the objects and the background. Extensive experiments and visualization results demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate. Besides, ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of each module.

AB Enterprise collaboration technologies (ECTs) are increasingly recognized for supporting effective and efficient digital collaboration, such as decision-making activities, among employees. Given the social and collaborative nature of ECT use, social network theory offers important and helpful insights into how and why employees' social network relations facilitate their ECT use. However, existing research primarily examines the effects of a single social network relation or several social network relations separately, without applying a holistic approach to investigate the joint effect of multiple social network relations on ECT use. Drawing on a novel technique of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and social network analysis, this study explores how multiple social network relations (i.e., advice, friendship, and communication) collectively influence ECT use. Using multi-source data from 178 employees in the human resources department of a global technology company, we identify several configurations of multiple social network relations associated with high ECT use and low ECT use. Our findings indicate that a single social network relation is insufficient to explain ECT use and should be considered alongside other social network relations. Overall, this study provides an integrative framework to unpack the complex and contingent effects of multiple social network relations on ECT use.

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has a network of interconnected medical devices to capture patients' health metrics and store them in a centralized server for analysis by medical experts. The security concerns in IoMT data are therefore very high. The attackers may inject malware into the IoMT data during its transmission. If the health parameters are affected by malware it may mislead the medical experts in making inferences about the patient's health. IoMT devices are resource-constrained and require faster analysis of data for better medical assistance. Most of the classification techniques used earlier suffer from exhaustive time and resource consumption. Hence, developing an intelligent framework that could reduce the data size and classify the malware quickly is essential. This paper proposes a deep learning framework called Auto-encoder to encode the IoMT data. The encoded features are then given to an XGBoost Classifier whose hyperparameters are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm. XGBoost Classifier detects the presence of malware in the IoMT dataset and Clamp dataset with an accuracy of 98.98% and 98.69% respectively. This lightweight model achieves dimensionality reduction through Autoencoder and effectively detects malware through an optimized XGBoost classifier with faster convergence and limited computational costs. Implementing this framework on the fog layer provides promising results by optimizing resource usage and saving time compared to previous works. Moreover, the proposed method does not need explicit feature selection from the dataset when making predictions.

AB Blast-induced overbreak in tunnels can cause severe damage and has therefore been a main concern in tunnel blasting. Researchers have developed many machine learning-based models to predict overbreak. Collecting overbreak data manually, however, can be challenging and might obtain insufficient or poorly structured data. Thus, this study aims to utilise a deep generative model, namely the Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN), to establish an acceptable dataset for overbreak prediction. The CTGAN model was applied to overbreak data collected from paired tunnels: a left-line tunnel and a right-line tunnel. The overbreak dataset collected from the left-line tunnel-nominated as the true dataset-served to train the CTGAN model. Then the well-trained CTGAN model generated a synthetic overbreak dataset. Statistical-based approaches verified the similarity between the true and synthetic datasets; machine learning-based approaches verified the feasibility of using the synthetic dataset to train overbreak prediction model. Lastly, this study clarified how to resolve the problem of data shortage and data imbalance by leveraging the CTGAN model. The results evidence that the CTGAN model can effectively generate a high-quality synthetic overbreak dataset. The synthetic overbreak dataset not only greatly retains the properties of the true dataset but also effectively enhances its diversity. The way, integrating the true and synthetic overbreak datasets, can dramatically resolve the problem of data shortage and data imbalance in overbreak prediction. The findings in this study, therefore, highlight it as a promising perspective to resolve such a particular engineering problem.

   Multi-layer perceptron; Siamese network
AB Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated promising performance in visual object tracking tasks. Never-theless, two drawbacks limited the potential performance improvement of transformer-based trackers. Firstly, the static receptive field of the tokens within one attention layer of the original self-attention learning neglects the multi-scale nature in the object tracking task. Secondly, the learning procedure of the multi-layer perception (MLP) in the feed forward network (FFN) is lack of local interaction information among samples. To address the above issues, a new self-attention learning method, fine-coarse concatenated attention (FCA), is proposed to learn self-attention with fine and coarse granularity information. Moreover, the cross-concatenation MLP (CC-MLP) is developed to capture local interaction information across samples. Based on the two proposed modules, a novel encoder and decoder are constructed, and augmented in an all-attention tracking algorithm, FCAT. Comprehensive experiments on popular tracking datasets, OTB2015, LaSOT, GOT-10K and TrackingNet, reveal the effectiveness of FCA and CC-MLP, and FCAT achieves the state-of-art on the datasets.

DE Ellipse detection; Chord computation; Cross ratio; Hough transform
AB This paper presents a new method for detecting ellipses in images, which has many applications in pattern recognition and robotic tasks. Previous approaches typically use sophisticated arc grouping strategies or calculate differential such as tangents, and thereby they are less efficient or more sensitive to noise. In this work, we present a novel ellipse detector, based on the simple yet effective chord computation, and on the projective invariant cross ratio, which achieves promising performance in both accuracy and efficiency. First, elliptical arcs are extracted by fast vector computations along with the removal of straight segments to speed up detection. Then, arcs from the same ellipse are grouped together according to the relative location and the intersecting chord constraints, both are on coherent chord computation without differential. Additionally, an efficient additive principle is applied to further accelerate the grouping process. Finally, a novel and robust verification by area-deduced cross ratio is introduced to pick out salient ellipses. Compared with predecessor methods, cross ratio is not only simple for computation, but also has invariant properties (used to discriminate ellipses). Extensive experiments on seven public datasets (including synthetic and real-world images) are implemented. The results highlight the salient advantages of the proposed method compared to state-of-theart detectors: Easier to implementation, more robust against occlusion and noise, as well as attaining higher F-measure.

AB Smart grid is envisaged as a power grid that is extremely reliable and flexible. The electrical grid has wide-area measuring devices like Phasor measurement units (PMUs) deployed to provide real-time grid information and resolve issues effectively and speedily without compromising system availability. The development and application of machine learning approaches for power system protection and state estimation have been facilitated by the availability of measurement data. This research proposes a transmission line fault detection and classification (FD&C) system based on an auto-encoder neural network. A comparison between a Multi-Layer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) network model and a Stacked Auto-Encoder neural network (SAE) is made. Additionally, the performance of the models developed is compared to that of state-of-the-art classifier models employing feature datasets acquired by wavelet transform based feature extraction as well as other deep learning models. With substantially shorter testing time, the suggested auto-encoder models detect faults with 100% accuracy and classify faults with 99.92% and 99.79% accuracy. The computational efficiency of the ML-ELM model is demonstrated with high accuracy of classification with training time and testing time less than 50 ms. To emulate real system scenarios the models are developed with datasets with noise with signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) ranging from 10 dB to 40 dB. The efficacy of the models is demonstrated with data from the IEEE 39 bus test system.

TI The effectiveness of supervised clustering for characterising flight
   diversions due to weather
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Flight diversions; Supervised clustering; Adverse weather
AB Flight diversions due to adverse weather have a significant negative impact on airspace users, airports , the environment. Previous work proposed a tree-based model that learned which flights are more likely to be diverted due to adverse weather conditions at the destination airport from historical traffic , weather data. This model was trained using confident learning to exclude from training unpredictable flight diversions caused by reasons other than weather, such as medical emergencies or technical problems. Aggregated performance metrics computed on the test set demonstrated high precision and moderate recall, and inspection of the Shapley values unravelled the most important features. Initial human observations made during the live trial, however, have raised a potential connection between the quality of predictions and the specific weather conditions that lead to flight diversions. This study aims to provide empirical evidence to support this hypothesis. To accomplish this, a data-driven methodology should be used to characterise the main conditions that cause flight diversions. Concurrently, the effectiveness of the model in each of these conditions should be evaluated. The dataset under consideration, however, presents a challenge because it contains a plethora of high-cardinality categorical features (e.g., destination airport and aircraft operator) as well as skewed numerical features with a wide range of scales (e.g., visibility and wind gust). This scenario significantly increases the difficulty of characterising the main conditions that cause flight diversions and conducting subsequent analyses even with established methods like factor analysis of mixed data. To address this challenge, this paper proposes to utilise supervised clustering, a method that combines state-of-the-art feature attribution, dimensionality reduction, and clustering algorithms to identify the most representative decisions of a model. Following that, the distinctive characteristics of the various decisions (e.g., extreme obscuration at the airport), each associated with a cluster, are determined by examining them. Finally, conventional classification and uncertainty metrics are computed for each cluster to assess the performance of the model. This paper shows that supervised clustering is effective in characterising flight diversions due to weather, and provides valuable insights into the performance of the model in different conditions, highlighting situations where predictions require careful consideration.

AB Nowadays, investors seek more sophisticated decision-making tools that maximize their profit from investing in the financial markets by suitably determining the optimal position, trading time, price, and volume. This paper proposes a novel intraday algorithmic trading system for volatile commodity futures markets based on a Deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm and its robust double-version (DDQN). The higher volatility, leverage property, and more liquidity in futures contracts give investors more opportunity to take advantage of speculative behaviors with a relatively small amount of capital; however, the volatility brings more difficulties in the learning phase. As an essential prerequisite to training and evaluating any trading algorithm in the futures market, we develop a simulator to replicate a real futures exchange market environment that executes recommended trading signals by handling the clearing and margin management and the pre-order checking mechanisms. Moreover, this study provides a new definition of the continuous state and action spaces that match the futures market's characteristics. To address the curse of dimensionality, we utilize a multi-agent architecture equipped with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to approximate the Q-values functions. The experimental results demonstrate that implementing the proposed trading algorithms (especially the DDQN) into the actual intraday data of gold coin futures contracts significantly outperforms the benchmarks in terms of return, risk, and risk-adjusted return.

AB Large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) is considered when the number of experts involved in the decision exceeds 20. Due to the large number of people involved in LSGDM, its decision-making process is uncertain, complex, and time-consuming. Therefore, how to effectively help large groups reach consensus in a complex environment is a challenge for current research. Consensus reaching process (CRP) is an effective tool to eliminate group conflicts. Based on this, we propose a consensus reaching process based on the Louvain algorithm, social network, and bounded confidence (SNBC) model with interval numbers. First, we use interval numbers to express expert opinions and social network relationships among experts. Second, the experts are clustered using the Louvain algorithm. The weights of experts are obtained by social network analysis. Third, we use the SNBC model to design a feedback mechanism for tripartite opinions. In addition, we give a numerical example and simulation experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, the comparative analysis shows the superiority of our method.

AB Animation drama and movies are important entertainment sources for children and young people. However, many of these entertainment videos introduce ideas such as violence, fighting, abuse, and car accidents, which are not suitable for children and young people. In order to prevent children from viewing these videos, different countries' government bodies put restrictions on age on these videos. Violence detection is mostly done using manual inspection, which is time and resource consuming and cannot achieve a very good result. Therefore, artificial technologies such as deep learning and machine learning can detect violence in a video. Bleeding is one of the distinct characteristics of violent actions presented in such videos. This paper aims to propose a system that can detect a given video's blood in real-time. Researchers have proposed different image processing-based techniques to detect violence, but their proposed systems lack precision and real-time detection. To this end, a deep learning-based approach is proposed to detect violence in a given video and images. A Faster R-CNN model is modified due to the sophisticated characteristics of the violence in the cartoon and animation images to achieve the highest performance. The backbone of the proposed violence detection model is changed to a modified RegNet model to extract the features from the frame. The standard inner lateral connection is replaced with the modulated deformable convolutional (MDC) layer to extract deformable feature maps. A novel distributed attention module (DAM) is proposed on the feature pyramid network to improve the performance of the feature extraction. The multiscale Region of interest (ROI) Align is adapted to improve the detection performance of violence in a different scenario. Moreover, the classification approach is integrated with the detection model to classify the different levels of violence in a given frame. We have explored state-of-the-art object detection methods such as Faster R-CNN, Cascade R-CNN, yolov3-spp, SSD, FCOS, and yolov5 to detect violence in a particular frame of a video. We compared the different models' performances and found out that the modified Faster R-CNN is appropriate for real-time blood detection in a given video or image with high accuracy. This study makes a significant contribution to detecting violence in animation videos which will help different platforms and government bodies to regulate entertainment content.

AB The causes analysis of road traffic accidents is often modelled based on high-dimensional small-sample data; however, such models often have low predictive accuracy and poor generalization performance. An analytical framework that considers both data augmentation and model optimization can enhance variable interpretation and predictive model performance, thereby improving the shortcomings of existing accident analysis methods. Our approach is as follows: 1) Starting with an analysis of the nature of road accidents, a symbolic operation is used to design a feature crosses algorithm. A random variable is added to construct a quantifiable feature se-lection algorithm, which can form a data augmentation method that conforms to the accident rules. 2) A highly reliable framework for analysing accident causes is constructed by using forward selection to optimize an ensemble learning model subset combined with feature crosses, feature selection and multiple-classification algorithms. A case study with accident data from a city in China shows that ensemble learning has the advantages of high predictive accuracy and strong generalization performance. It can accurately identify the key causes of accidents based on highly dimensional small-sample data. Driving behaviours such as lane changes and turns are the key causes of accidents. Giving drivers effective traffic environment information in a timely manner can significantly improve driving performance and reduce accident risk. This research provides a reference for the analysis of road accidents.

AB The non-differentiability of the spike activity has been a hindrance to the development of high-performance spiking neural networks (SNNs). Current learning algorithms mainly focus on achieving attractive SNNs based on surrogate gradient or conversion, yet their performance is still limited. The probability-based SNNs use the probabilistic mechanism to smooth out spike activity, showing a promising way for training SNNs. This work optimizes the probabilistic mechanism and proposes the probabilistic firing mechanism (PFM) for spiking neurons. PFM enables differentiable spike activity and can be adapted to a variety of spiking neurons. In addition, to eliminate the negative influence of probabilistic uncertainty, the attention discrimination mechanism (ADM) is proposed, which enables the neurons to respond efficiently by adaptively distinguishing the salient elements of the input current. By fusing PFM, ADM, and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons, we constructed the Probabilistic Attention Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PALIF) neuron and Probabilistic Attention Spiking Neural Network (PASNN). Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of PFM and ADM, and indicate that PASNN is suitable for low-latency scenarios. Experiments on both static image and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-MNIST, and CIFAR10-DVS, demonstrate that PASNN achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and inference speed.

AB It is well-understood that the performance of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) in image recognition tasks is influenced not only by shape but also by texture information. Despite this, understanding the internal representations of DCNNs remains a challenging task. This study employs a simplified version of the Portilla-Simoncelli Statistics, termed "minPS,"to explore how texture information is represented in a pre -trained VGG network. Using minPS features extracted from texture images, we perform a sparse regression on the activations across various channels in VGG layers. Our findings reveal that channels in the early to middle layers of the VGG network can be effectively described by minPS features. Additionally, we observe that the explanatory power of minPS sub-groups evolves as one ascends the network hierarchy. Specifically, sub-groups termed Linear Cross Scale (LCS) and Energy Cross Scale (ECS) exhibit weak explanatory power for VGG channels. To investigate the relationship further, we compare the original texture images with their synthesized counterparts, generated using VGG, in terms of minPS features. Our results indicate that the absence of certain minPS features suggests their non-utilization in VGG's internal representations.

AB Recent Transformer-based networks have shown impressive performance on single image denoising tasks. While the Transformer model promotes the interaction of long-range features, it generally involves high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a feature-enhanced denoising network (FEDNet) by combining CNN architectures with Transformers. Specifically, we propose an effective cross-channel attention to boost the interaction of channel information and enhance channel features. In order to fully exploit image features, we incorporate Transformer blocks into minimum-scale layers of the network, which can not only capture the long-distance dependency of low-resolution features but also reduce the multiplier-accumulator operations (MACs). Meanwhile, a structure-preserving block is designed to enhance the structural feature extraction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art denoising performance with low computational costs.

AB Livestream e-commerce has been developing at a tremendous pace in recent years. On livestream platforms, such as Douyin, a retailer attracts viewers into the live room through short video advertising, and then streamers promote and sell products in real time. In such a scenario, an accurate prediction of traffic and sales plays an essential role in operation management, including live content strategy and inventory control. However, complex behaviors (follow, share, comment, etc.) of users and long conversion paths (from seeing the advertisement to entering the live room, and to purchasing the goods) lead to poor performance of traditional prediction methods. Additionally, few studies focus on advertising information in evaluating live room performance. Therefore, we propose a two-stage learning model for traffic and sales prediction based on behavior mining, which combines marketing models and deep learning methods. In the first stage, we integrate user behaviors before getting into the live room with short video advertising data for traffic prediction. In the second stage, based on the traditional marketing model, AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action), we design a funnel convolutional neural network (FCNN) to learn sophisticated behaviors in the live room in both time and behavior orientations, and take the predicted traffic volume as the auxiliary information for sales prediction. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from Douyin illustrate the efficacy of our proposed method, which shows the value of fusing marketing models with deep learning techniques. Furthermore, the in-depth analysis provides practical insights into user behaviors for livestream e-commerce.

ID CONTINUUM ROBOTS; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION
AB The use of soft robotics to perform tasks and interact with the environment requires good system identification. Data-driven methods offer a promising alternative where traditional analytical model-based techniques have proven insufficient. However, their use has been limited and under-explored in soft robotics. The novelty of this research lies in the application of Gaussian processes to soft robotics and the exploration of approximate Gaussian processes (AGP) and deep Gaussian processes (DGP) methods. It highlights the advantages of Gaussian processes in modeling uncertainty, incorporating prior knowledge, and handling complex systems. This is achieved through the identification of the forward and inverse kinematics of a two-degree-of-freedom soft robotic arm actuated by three tendons. A comparison is made between different configurations using Gaussian processes and the results are also compared with those obtained from the analytical model of the kinematics and an artificial neural network (ANN). The research contributes to the development of more efficient and accurate techniques for system identification, kinematics modeling, and control in soft robotics.

AB This paper presents an horizontal technique to classify the main directions of orientation of the planar surfaces that conform solid bodies. When mathematically representing these surfaces via 3D point clouds, a cascade or chain process using combined information of the point positions and of their detected normal vectors is applied to solidly identify the planar surfaces composing them and to retrieve their orientations. This technique distinguishes itself from others in the field due to (i) a specific filtering inspired by image processing techniques that aims to mitigate the effects that surface rugosity-induced mathematical noise can induce on the classification; and (ii) also due to the data representation on the unit-sphere using the von Mises-Fisher mixture model. The extents and limits of the proposed process are presented using several validation cases of increasing complexity, and its results and possibilities for horizontal applications over many kinds of real-life bodies are also analysed.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The initial production sequences of a multi-stage automotive flow shop (MSAFS) have a chance to be disturbed by emergency orders from the market or warehouses. This kind of disturbance can hinder a timely resequencing, and an improper resequencing scheme would increase the total production costs and delivery delays. To tackle this problem, a collaborative resequencing approach for a MSAFS is proposed enabled by a multi-core promisingregion evolutionary algorithm (PREA) to deal with emergency orders for an efficient optimization of resequencing during the automotive production. First, considering the characteristics of automotive production, a sliding window-based collaborative resequencing strategy is proposed to cope with emergency orders. Then, a model that integrates the welding, painting, and assembly processes is described mathematically to minimize production costs and delivery delays. Next, a multi-core PREA is developed to optimize the collaborative resequencing model with high efficiency. Finally, a case study is conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach. The numerical results indicate that the proposed approach is capable of realizing an effective resequencing optimization with high computational performance in terms of handling emergency orders for automotive production.

AB Recently Recommender Systems (RS) have become crucial tools to deal with information retrieval and filtering in various applications, such as online business, social network and so on. However, with the ever-increasing scale of social network and information overload, RS still suffer from data sparsity and heavy computational complexity, and even confront a serious challenge to further improve the recommender performance and user experience. To this end, this article propose a novel multi-view social recommendation scenario referred to as MsRec, which takes account of available information for item recommendation from multiple perspectives. More specifically, MsRec tries to exploit intricate inner relationship within social network, and perform user-level preference learning for each user without overlapping, moreover, MsRec leverages available side information, such as contextual information, demographic characteristics and item attributes, to perform representation vector learning for items, which will be further utilized for item similarity calculation via Cosine method. With the learned social influence and item similarity coefficient, MsRec could perform representation vector learning for users and items, and further provide rating prediction and item recommendation. In addition, theoretical analysis indicates that MsRec could achieve convergence with sub-linear convergence rate during model training phase, and yield high performance in social recommendation, without heavy computational cost. Experimental analysis over Yelp, Epinions and DoubanMovie also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MsRec, which can achieve significant improvements while compared to other benchmark recommender algorithms, and provide much better user experience.

DE Question answering; Knowledge graph; Semantic parsing; Contrastive
   learning; Sampling augmentation
AB Current encoder-decoders for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) commonly utilize teacher-forcing training to accelerate convergence. However, this training approach limits the model's exposure to ground truths, resulting in exposure bias that hampers generalization performance during autoregressive inference. To alleviate the issue, we propose a contrastive framework that enables the model to access a variety of positive and negative examples, thereby enhancing generalization. Firstly, we introduce a sampling augmentation strategy to construct contrastive samples, which can ensure explicit semantic consistency of positive pairs and inconsistency of negative pairs. Secondly, we augment the training process by incorporating "hard"negatives to enhance the contrastive objective, along with augmented positives to improve the generation objective. Finally, we also sample multiple logical forms for each question during the inference to reduce the bias potential and train a contrastive ranking model to obtain the target logical form. We achieve improvements of 1.95% and 1% over the previous state-of-the-art methods on the KQA Pro and OVERNIGHT benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, our approach obtains competitive results on the WebQSP dataset. These findings validate the efficacy of our contrastive framework for advancing KGQA performance.

AB The purpose of this study is to develop a novel multi-class differential system (target network, protected network, inside attacker, and outside attacker) for a cyber war model that imitating the cyber war scenarios on different attack surfaces in the presence of multifarious attack vectors and analysis has been presented by stupendous knacks of intelligent predictive stochastic networks (IPSNs). The theoretical convergence analysis through attack-free and attack-invasion equilibrium in terms of basic reproduction number R-0 has been presented along with the global stability of attack-free equilibrium points using the Lyapunov function. The reference solutions for studying the dynamics of all four classes of cyber war models in an air-gapped environment have also been determined in this paper for various scenarios by varying the protection strategy parameter rho, the recovery strategy parameter epsilon, and the rate of attack from an outside/inside attacker using the Adams numerical method. The obtained data has been used in IPSNs as input/targets for training, validation, and testing in order to compute the approximate solution of the model. Extensive simulations have been run to determine the accuracy of the proposed framework for a complex advanced persistent attack targeting industrial systems. The outcomes of IPSNs have shown a fine resemblance with the matching of order 10(-7) from the observed data. Also, the analysis based on mean square error convergence, error histogram, and regression index has further verified the strength and worth of the presented strategy.

AB Transfer learning involves using previously learnt knowledge of a model task in addressing another task. However, this process works well when the tasks are closely related. It is, therefore, important to select data points that are closely relevant to the previous task and fine-tune the suitable pre-trained model's layers for effective transfer. This work utilises the least divergent textural features of the target datasets and pre-trained model's layers, minimising the lost knowledge during the transfer learning process. This study extends previous works on selecting data points with good textural features and dynamically selected layers using divergence measures by combining them into one model pipeline. Five pre-trained models are used: ResNet50, DenseNet169, InceptionV3, VGG16 and MobileNetV2 on nine datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Stanford Dogs, Caltech 256, ISIC 2016, ChestX-ray8 and MIT Indoor Scenes. Experimental results show that data points with lower textural feature divergence and layers with more positive weights give better accuracy than other data points and layers. The data points with lower divergence give an average improvement of 3.54% to 6.75%, while the layers improve by 2.42% to 13.04% for the CIFAR-100 dataset. Combining the two methods gives an extra accuracy improvement of 1.56%. This combined approach shows that data points with lower divergence from the source dataset samples can lead to a better adaptation for the target task. The results also demonstrate that selecting layers with more positive weights reduces instances of trial and error in selecting fine-tuning layers for pre-trained models.

AB To enhance the performance of object detection algorithm, this paper proposes segmentation attention feature pyramid network (SAFPN) to address the issue of semantic information loss. Compared to prior works, SAFPN discards the original 1 x 1 convolutions and achieves feature dimension reduction through a segmentation and accumulation architecture, thereby preserving the semantic information of high-dimensional features completely. To capture fine-grained semantic details, it integrates channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to enhance the network's focus on important information. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAFPN achieves favorable results on multiple public datasets, and can better complete the target detection task.

AB This article investigates the problem of energy-constrained stealthy attack strategy against remote state estimation for cyber-physical systems. Taking into account the energy constraint, the malicious attacker is required to schedule the off-line generated signals to modify the transmitted data with limited times over a finite-time horizon under the stealthiness condition, which makes the design of attack strategy more complex. Different from the attack schedules which are studied on the basis of prescribed attack signals in the existing results, the attack strategy is presented under the framework of collaborative design to deteriorate the estimation performance to the largest extent, which yet leads to the coupling between the attack schedules and attack signals. To overcome the difficulty without sacrificing the optimality, the attack design problem is solved in two steps. First, analyze the problem with the given attack schedule to derive the optimal attack signals. Then, the optimal schedule is obtained by efficiently solving the nonlinear 0-1 programming problem based on the algorithm of reducing the search space which is designed to eliminate a part of the nonoptimal solutions. To demonstrate the theoretical results, a simulation example is provided.

AB This article proposes a predefined-time leader-following consensus control scheme for a second-order multiagent system (MAS) whose communication network is subject to channel fading. New distributed observers are designed to achieve prescribed-time leader's states estimation under undirected graph and digraph over faded communication channel. Then, a new adaptive dynamic surface predefined-time control is developed for the elimination of the mismatched disturbances stemmed from estimation error and achieving practical predefined-time leader-following consensus. It is proved that the developed control approach achieves predefined-time consensus tracking. This article's contribution is to propose novel distributed observers to remove the influence of channel fading and estimate leader's states under undirected graph and digraph within prescribed time and develop a novel predefined-time control to achieve predefined-time consensus tracking over fading channel. A simulation example verifies that the designed control scheme is effective.

AB Laser beam welding has become widely applied in many industrial fields in recent years. Solidification cracks remain one of the most common welding faults that can prevent a safe welded joint. In civil engineering, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used to detect cracks in roads and buildings by analysing images of the constructed objects. These cracks are found in static objects, whereas the generation of a welding crack is a dynamic process. Detecting the formation of cracks as early as possible is greatly important to ensure high welding quality. In this study, two end-to-end models based on long short-term memory and three-dimensional convolutional networks (3D-CNN) are proposed for automatic crack formation detection. To achieve maximum accuracy with minimal computational complexity, we progressively modify the model to find the optimal structure. The controlled tensile weldability test is conducted to generate long videos used for training and testing. The performance of the proposed models is compared with the classical neural network ResNet-18, which has been proven to be a good transfer learning model for crack detection. The results show that our models can detect the start time of crack formation earlier, while ResNet-18 only detects cracks during the propagation stage.

AB Many-objective optimization problems pose a great challenge for traditional Pareto-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), due to the loss of selection pressure (pressure that drives the population evolution) and the difficulty of diversity maintenance. To relieve the above challenge, this paper proposes a many-objective evolutionary algorithm based on novel fitness estimation and grouping layering (called MaOEA-FEGL). The novel fitness estimation mechanism can increase selection pressure and maintain diversity simultaneously by integrating the designed cos function-based convergence measure and adaptive mapping angle distance-based diversity measure. Meanwhile, a grouping layering strategy is proposed for further enhancing convergence and diversity, which divides individuals into different groups. Then, the individuals in each group are stratified into different layers by the R2 indicator. Based on the above mechanism and strategy, a two-round environmental selection strategy is designed to select elite individuals for the next generation. In addition, a variable classification-based initialization technique is designed to generate a high-quality initialization population and further provide a good start for the subsequent population evolution. Experimental studies on two well-known benchmark suites and two real-world engineering applications with objective numbers varying from 3 to 20 demonstrate that our algorithm is highly competitive compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, two new distance measures are introduced, which are used in various application problems in decision-making, pattern recognition, and clustering. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are sources of information that contain both the membership and non-membership degrees of the elements in the set. As such, distance measures based on geometric concepts are sometimes misleading. Hence, six parameters are identified to construct the distance measures. These parameters are membership information dissimilarity, non-membership information dissimilarity, hesitancy information dissimilarity, product cross-information dissimilarity, maximum cross-information dissimilarity, and minimum cross-information dissimilarity. Among all the parameters, the product cross-information dissimilarity is newly introduced in this work. Compensations for the proposed distance measures are established by various counter-intuitive problems in decision-making and pattern recognition. Finally, validation of the proposed distance measures is established by diverse problems of applications in decision-making, pattern recognition, and clustering problems.

AB Semantic memory is characterized by a hierarchical organization of concepts based on shared properties. However, this aspect is insufficiently dealt with in recent neurocomputational models. Moreover, in many cognitive problems that exploit semantic memory, gamma-band synchronization can be relevant in favoring information processing and feature binding. In this work, we propose an attractor network model of semantic memory. Each computational unit, coding for a different feature, is described with a neural mass circuit oscillating in the gamma range. The model is trained with an original nonsymmetric Hebb rule based on a presynaptic gating mechanism. After training, the network creates a taxonomy of categories, distinguishes between subordinate and superordinate concepts, and discriminates between salient and marginal features. Examples are provided concerning a fourteen-animal taxonomy, including several subcategories. A sensitivity analysis reveals the robustness of the network but also points out conditions leading to confusion among categories, similar to the one observed in dreaming and some neurological disorders. Finally, the analysis emphasizes the role of fast GABAergic interneurons and inhibitory-excitatory balance to allow the correct synchronization of features. The model represents an original attempt to deal with a hierarchical organization of objects in semantic memory and correlated patterns, still exploiting gamma-band synchronization to favor neural processing. The same ideas, introduced in a more sophisticated multilayer network, can deepen our knowledge of semantic memory organization in the brain. Finally, they can open new perspectives in quantitatively analyzing neurological disorders connected with distorted semantics.

AB Depression is a serious mental health condition that affects a person's ability to feel happy and engaged in activities. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in depression due to factors such as isolation, financial stress, and uncertainty about the future. Additionally, restrictions on travel and socializing have contributed to feelings of loneliness and isolation. In this research, we present a deep learning framework named CoDeS (COVID-caused depression symptoms) for detecting prodromes of depression in online users caused due to COVID pandemic. This framework uses a combination of CNN, LSTM, and integrated CNN-LSTM techniques, with three different feature representation methods, viz. Word2Vec, TF-IDF, and BERT. Nine experiments were conducted on individual and integrated models, and the results were evaluated based on the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) performance metric. The highest accuracy value of 98.95% was recorded for the TF-IDF-based integrated CNN+LSTM model. When the same integrated model was trained using Word2Vec and BERT-based features, it still performed well with an accuracy of 97.32% and 98.51% respectively. The results demonstrate that the TF-IDF-based feature representation performed better than the Word2Vec and BERT-based feature representations for the CNN and LSTM models in identifying COVID-caused depression symptoms. The proposed approaches showcased substantial advancements over the existing ones, with significant improvements in accuracy. TF-IDF-CNN+LSTM achieved an accuracy approximately 37.28% higher, while BERT-CNN, BERT-LSTM, and BERT-CNN+LSTM achieved accuracy enhancements of approximately 29.78%, 34.44%, and 27.14% respectively. These accuracy improvements demonstrate the superior classification capabilities of the proposed approaches, leading to more precise depression analysis outcomes. In terms of F1 measure, the proposed approaches consistently demonstrated superior performance, with F1 measure values ranging from 0.965 to 0.987. BERT-CNN+LSTM achieved the highest F1 measure, highlighting its balanced precision and recall. Overall, the proposed approaches outperformed existing ones in terms of recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 measure, with improvements ranging from 27.14 to 44.85%. By incorporating advanced techniques such as TF-IDF, CNN, LSTM, and BERT, more accurate and reliable sentiment analysis outcomes can be achieved, offering the potential for enhanced applications in this field.

AB Recently, the topics associated with robotics are becoming an interesting research area. Meanwhile, intelligent mobile robots or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has great acceptance; however, the navigation and control of the devices are more complex. The shortage of dealing with static obstacles and evading them due to secure and safe routing is a fundamental need of the system. Therefore, an effectual robotic obstacle avoidance mechanism using deep learning (DL) model optimized with a swarm intelligence procedure is proposed. The main aim of this method is to avoid collision with static obstacles and attain the target in an optimal path. At first, the proposed method initializes the obstacles and target places for mobile robot navigation, and their positions are collected. An innovative path planning approach is presented using adaptive beetle swarm levy flight optimization (BSLFO) for optimal path calculation. Here, distance and path smoothness parameters are considered for optimal planning by the proposed BSLFO approach. The mobile robots are moved to the best positions obtained by the BSLFO approach. Additionally, optimal robots' movement with collision avoidance has been performed by employing a fuzzy rule based optimal deep neural network (FRDNN). The proposed method is implemented in the MATLAB platform and evaluates the performance in terms of performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and planning time. The maximum accuracy reached by the proposed method for static and dynamic obstacles is 98.62, which offers better obstacle avoidance and effective path planning. Consequently, the overall experimental outcomes proved that the proposed model outperforms the existing models.

In the third step, by using the traditional as well as the bounding box augmentation and road damage generative adversarial network based augmentation techniques, the precision and the robustness of road damage detector under different environmental and field conditions have been improved. Finally, through the ensemble of the best models, the final detector accuracy has been enhanced. The findings of this article indicate that by using the proposed approach, the values of mAP and F1-score are improved by 13.79% and 7.58%, respectively.

SO IET IMAGE PROCESSING

DT Article; Early Access
DE image watermarking; steganography
AB Steganography and secret sharing are schemes to increase the security of private information against attackers. Steganography emphasizes secrecy while secret sharing distributes the secret key in shares that are conditionally classified to reconstruct the original secret. This paper introduces a counting-based secret sharing scheme that aims to reduce the computational complexity for longer keys, thereby providing a practical steganographic approach for efficient sharing. The scheme integrates counting-based secret sharing with integer wavelet transform (IWT) and steganography. The subscriptions created using the Hamming code are embedded in the cover image. Using this method, IWT significantly reduces the occurrence of common rounding errors. As a result, secret key extraction becomes very accurate and eliminates the need to access the original images. This design, using secret sharing based on counting, not only has simplicity and efficiency, but also features such as flexibility, scalability, and lack of central authority. In addition, high-quality steganography was obtained for keys with lengths of 64, 256, 512, 1024, and 3072, showing an average PSNR=80.11 in different color images. This outstanding performance makes it a highly efficient alternative to previous designs, representing a groundbreaking contribution with significant public interest in the field.
   We enhanced involving integer wavelet transform (IWT) steganography with secret-sharing via Hamming code adopting integers coefficients to avoid common rounding errors problem allowing the secret key to be extracted precisely without demanding the original images. The design calculations enjoyed faster processing among available state-of-the-art discrete wavelet transform schemes. It further obtained high-quality steganography making it highly efficient compared to previous schemes, making this contribution in an overall attractive research pioneering position.image

AB This paper aims to study people's trust in the capabilities of social robots in the context of digital transformation. Firstly, the current application status of social robots is studied. Then, the capability trust problem of social robots is studied according to the existing problems and phenomena. Students from a municipal experimental middle school are selected for a questionnaire survey, and the anthropomorphism of social robots is taken as the independent variable. The role of social robots with different anthropomorphic degrees on students' initial capability trust and the mediating role of attraction perception are studied. A research model is established, and SPSS 26.0 is used to further analyse the data. The results show that among the students with a low degree of an anthropomorphic social robot, the average score of anthropomorphism is 2.52, the average score of attraction perception is 3.29, and the score of capability trust is 3.64, which is the upper-middle level. There are significant differences in the initial capability trust evaluation of social robots among students of different ages (F = 38.13, P = 0.00). When the degree of anthropomorphism of social robots is at different levels, there are significant differences in students' initial capability trust evaluation (F = 34.25, P = 0.00). It can be seen that the degree of anthropomorphism of social robots has an impact on students' initial capability trust.

AB This paper deals with a high-resolution algorithm that engages fuzzy transform to solve three-dimensional nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations. The scheme approximates the fuzzy components, which estimate fourth-order accurate solutions at the interior mesh points of the solution domain. The fuzzy components and triangular base functions will be approximated with a nineteen-point linear combination of solution values and related to exact solutions by a linear system. Such an arrangement along with compact discretization yields a block tridiagonal Jacobian matrix, and an iterative solver can efficiently compute them. The convergence analysis and error bound of the scheme are examined in detail. The method provides an order-preserving solution and applies to a comprehensive class of partial differential equations with nonlinear first-order partial derivatives. Numerical simulations with Helmholtz equation, advection-diffusion-reaction equation, and nonlinear elliptic sine-Gordan equation corroborate the utility, convergence rate, and enhance solution accuracy by employing a new scheme.

AB When solar irradiation is uniform along with the array, the P-V curve represents a unique maximum power point (MPP). If the cells undergo shade conditions in the presence of bypass diodes, the solar array's power is decreased, and the P-V curve of the array represents multiple local MPPs (LMPP) and a global MPP (GMPP). LMPPs might mislead the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms because their characteristics are identical to the MPP. Various studies have been conducted on partial shading conditions. This study uses parallel distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) due to the advantages of this structure. A high-gain converter is presented to resolve the high conversion gain required by the DC/DC converter in this structure. This study also presents MLP and RBF networks for MPP tracking and compares their efficiencies under the same irradiation and partial shading conditions. Since determining optimal weight coefficients in MLP neural networks and variances, means, and weights in RBF networks play an essential role in their performance, this study uses four optimization algorithms of particle swarm optimization (PSO), gray wolf optimization (GWO), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and Harris Hawks optimization (HHO). Finally, an adaptive fuzzy-PID controller controls the three-phase grid-connected inverter. A comparison of the results shows that the efficiency of MLP and RBFII is almost the same, about 98-99%. Moreover, the accuracy of MLP networks is higher than RBF, and RBF networks' only advantage is shorter training time. In addition, RBF networks require much more activation functions for proper performance. The simulation outcomes confirm the superior efficacy of the HHO algorithm in training neural networks when compared to alternative algorithms.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) technology exhibits significant potential as a form of energy due to its green characteristics. Nevertheless, the modeling of PV modules is subject to unpredictability due to the fluctuating levels of heat and irradiance. To optimize efficiency and reduce the return on investment of a PV system, it is necessary to keep the PV panels at the highest possible power point (MPP). The application of fuzzy logic control-based intelligent maximum power point tracking (MPPT) approach is found to be more appropriate than traditional techniques in PV systems for addressing the issue of unpredictability. The study presents an investigation of an isolated PV system that utilizes a push-pull converter in conjunction with a fuzzy logic-based MPPT technique. To address the previously mentioned issues, this research proposes the utilization of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) that is centered on a modified sparrow search algorithm (MSSA) as a means to enhance the performance of the current MPPT controllers. The findings demonstrated the efficacy of the recommended approach in precisely following the global maximum power point (GMPP) with improved convergence rates and reduced power fluctuations when compared to alternative methods. The PV system, which incorporates the MSSA-MPPT algorithm, has been developed with MATLAB/SIMULINK program. The mathematical evaluation of the proposed approach, which increases the tracking effectiveness of PV systems to 99.7%, is well validated by the system findings. In instances where the solar array fails to generate sufficient energy to satisfy the required demand, the Battery Energy Storage (BES) system is activated to ensure continuous power within the test system.

AB As a direct extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, picture fuzzy sets have a powerful ability to deal with vague, uncertain and inconsistent information. The distance between picture fuzzy sets is an effective mathematical tool to distinguish the difference between objects. Although various distances have been proposed, there are some distances that do not meet the axiomatic definition of distance or some distances that induce counter-intuitive results. To address the above defects, this paper gives a new distance between picture fuzzy sets by aggregating three-dimensional divergence, due to the capability of divergence to distinguish information. This new distance not only satisfies the axiomatic definition, but also overcomes the counter-intuitive defects. Furthermore, the proposed distance is applied to solve the multi-attribute decision-making problem. Through comparison and analysis of decision results, this distance not only provides reasonable decision results, but also has high degree of confidence.

AB A significant challenge in viral marketing is the efficient identification of a group of influential users within a given network, maximizing the spread of influence, known as influence maximization (IM). Numerous strategies have been put forth to gauge users' influence and pinpoint influential user sets within social networks. These include greedy, heuristic, etc. However, using greedy algorithms to solve the IM problem is not ideal, as they are time-consuming and lack of scalability when dealing with large-scale networks. While heuristic-based approaches offer practical efficiency, they lack theoretical guarantees. To address these challenges, this work uses approach called metaheuristic-Golden ratio optimization method (GROM-IM) for optimizing the IM problem. In addition, our methodology incorporates the expected diffusion value function, which provides a reliable estimate of expected influence spread under both linear threshold and independent cascade models. This method selects the most effective nodes. The outcomes from experiments conducted on five actual social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the base algorithm in terms of both efficiency and the extent of influence spread.

AB The production decision of a large commodity or equipment manufacturing enterprise can be modeled as a newsvendor problem. Managers must determine the optimal production volume in advance to minimize the underage cost and the overage cost. However, the traditional newsvendor problem assumes the known demand distribution, which is not the case in practice. Data-driven approaches have become the hot research topic and opened up new avenues for such issues. Recent studies have considered demand-related features but have failed to address how to optimize production and inventory using informative textual reviews, not just numerical feature data. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven newsvendor model that leverages sentiment analysis on textual reviews using a deep learning model to solve the data-driven newsvendor problem by integrating estimation and optimization. Experiments on real data show that our proposed method reduces the average cost by approximately 14.18% compared to the most advanced deep neural network method, making it the best-performing method. Furthermore, our method is more suitable for situations where unit shortage costs are greater than unit overage costs. Finally, our method is robust in terms of sample size and can still obtain good results even with insufficient historical data.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; ALGORITHM
AB An Improved binary Non-Linear Convergent Bi-phase Mutated Grey Wolf Optimizer (IbGWO) is proposed for solving feature selection problems with two main goals reducing irrelevant features and maximizing accuracy. We used stratified k$$ k $$-fold cross-validation that performs stratified sampling on the data to avoid overfitting problems. The fitness function used in the proposed algorithm allows choosing the solution with the minimum number of features if more than one feature has the same highest accuracy. When stratified cross-validation is performed, the split datasets contain the same share of the feature of interest as the actual dataset. During stratified sampling, the cross-validation result minimizes the generalization error to a considerable extent, with a smaller variance. Feature selection could be seen as an optimization problem that efficiently removes irrelevant data from high-dimensional data to reduce computation time and improve learning accuracy. This paper proposes an improved Non-Linear Convergent Bi-Phase Mutated Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (IbGWO) algorithm for feature selection. The bi-phase mutation enhances the rate of exploitation of GWO, where the first mutation phase minimizes the number of features and the second phase adds more informative features for accurate feature selection. A non-linear tangent trigonometric function is used for convergence to generalize better while handling heterogeneous data. To accelerate the global convergence speed, an inertia weight is added to control the position updating of the grey wolves. Feature-weighted K-Nearest Neighbor is used to enhance classification accuracy, where only relevant features are used for feature selection. Experimental results confirm that IbGWO outperforms other algorithms in terms of average accuracy of 0.8716, average number of chosen features of 6.13, average fitness of 0.1717, and average standard deviation of 0.0072 tested on different datasets and in terms of statistical analysis. IbGWO is also benchmarked using unimodal, multimodal, and IEEE CEC 2019 functions, where it outperforms other algorithms in most cases. Three classical engineering design problems are also solved using IbGWO, which significantly outperforms other algorithms. Moreover, the overtaking percentage of the proposed algorithm is 69.56%$$ 69.56\% $$.

   Short- and medium-term forecasting
AB Multivariate time series forecasting is an important issue in industries, agriculture, finance, and other applications. There are many challenging problems in it such as non-linear and complicated relationships among the series. The entanglement of latent multiple different sequence patterns maybe one of the most reasons for the time series complex behavior, and decomposition can help reveal the hidden evolution law. Graph is a good modelling tool for multiple entities and graph neural network has showed better learning ability for spatial dependence, but its high memory consumption requires valid solutions. Inspired by the above two points, we propose a Temporal Decomposition enhanced Graph neural network for Multivariate time Series Forecasting, namely TDG4MSF, which mainly consists of four components: temporal decomposition enhanced representation learning, graph structure learning, gated GNNML-based representation learning and MLP-based forecasting. A progressive quadratic decomposition architecture is designed in the temporal decomposition enhanced representation learning that extracts the different periodic patterns of time series. Graph structure learning is used to construct adjacency matrix to represent the spatial topological structure. The temporal decomposition enhanced representation and adjacency matrix are fed into gated GNNML to integrating temporal and spatial information between variables. A MLP-based forecasting is utilized to make multivariate time series prediction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our model in short- and medium-term prediction scenarios are superior to the state-of-the-art methods, which help make exact decisions timely.

DE Transfer learning; Fault diagnosis; Transformer; Convolutional neural
   network; Few-shot
AB Fault diagnosis of industrial processes plays an important role in avoiding heavy losses and ensuring production safety. Complex industrial processes often have many working conditions, and the actual industrial process often concentrates on certain working conditions. As a result, the running time of some working conditions is shorter, so the data of these conditions are difficult to obtain. However, almost all fault diagnosis methods based on Deep Learning (DL) requires a large amount of data. Therefore, it is a big challenge to realize the fault diagnosis of few-shot industrial processes. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a Deep Feature Transfer Fusion (DFTF) framework based on hybrid domain transfer learning. The purpose is to take few-shot working conditions as the target domain and carry out fault diagnosis for them. As the features of industrial process images are more complex, this paper introduces Pyramid Hybrid Vision Transformer (PHVT) model, which have stronger feature extraction capabilities and spatial perception, as feature extraction module. In order to improve the transferability of the model, this paper introduces the In-Cross Domain Hybrid Transfer Learning (ICTL) method. By fusing the general object features from ResNet50 which pre-trained under public dataset of common object and the features extracted from PHVT which pre-trained under industrial dataset of multiple working conditions, the adaptability of the model to different scenes is enhanced. The experimental results based on Pronto dataset of Process System Engineering lab of Cranfield University show that the proposed transfer learning method has excellent performance.

AB Recently, large pretrained language models (PLMs) have led a revolution in the information retrieval community. In most PLMs-based retrieval frameworks, the ranking performance broadly depends on the model structure and the semantic complexity of the input text. Sequence-to-sequence generative models for question answering or text generation have proven to be competitive, so we wonder whether these models can improve ranking effectiveness by enhancing input semantics. This article introduces SE-BERT, a semantically enhanced bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) based ranking framework that captures more semantic information by modifying the input text. SE-BERT utilizes a pretrained generative language model to summarize both sides of the candidate passage and concatenate them into a new input sequence, allowing BERT to acquire more semantic information within the constraints of the input sequence's length. Experimental results from two Text Retrieval Conference datasets demonstrate that our approach's effectiveness increasing as the length of the input text increases.

AB The text in the natural scene can express rich semantic information, which helps people understand and analyse daily things. This paper focuses on the problems of discrete text spatial distribution and variable text geometric size in natural scenes with complex backgrounds and proposes an end-to-end natural scene text detection method based on DBNet. The authors first use IResNet as the backbone network, which does not increase network parameters while retaining more text features. Furthermore, a module with Transformer is introduced in the feature extraction stage to strengthen the correlation between high-level feature pixels. Then, the authors add a spatial pyramid pooling structure in the end of feature extraction, which realises the combination of local and global features, enriches the expressive ability of feature maps, and alleviates the detection limitations caused by the geometric size of features. Finally, to better integrate the features of each level, a dual attention module is embedded after multi-scale feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the MSRA-TD500, CTW1500, ICDAR2015, and MLT2017 data set are conducted. The results showed that IDBNet can improve the average precision, recall, and F-measure of a text compared with the state of art text detection methods and has higher predictive ability and practicability.
   This paper designs an improved natural text detection algorithm based on DBNet to solve the problems of discrete spatial distribution of text and diversity of a text geometric size. On multiple public text detection datasets, the F-measure of the proposed method achieves advanced detection performance, which fully verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.image

To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight and efficient road damage detection algorithm LE-YOLOv5 based on YOLOv5. We propose a global shuffle attention module to improve the shortcomings of the SE attention module in MobileNetV3, which in turn builds a better backbone feature extraction network. It greatly reduces the parameters and GFLOPS of the model while increasing the computational speed. To construct a simple and efficient neck network, a lightweight hybrid convolution is introduced into the neck network to replace the standard convolution. Meanwhile, we introduce the lightweight coordinate attention module into the cross-stage partial network module that was designed using the one-time aggregation method. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free attentional feature fusion (PAFF) module, which significantly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information at a long distance by guiding and enhancing correlation learning between the channel direction and spatial direction without introducing additional parameters. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to make the anchor boxes more suitable for the dataset. Finally, we use a label smoothing algorithm to improve the generalization ability of the model. The experimental results show that the LE-YOLOv5 proposed in this document can stably and effectively detect road damage. Compared to YOLOv5s, LE-YOLOv5 reduces the parameters by 52.6% and reduces the GFLOPS by 57.0%. However, notably, the mean average precision (mAP) of our model improves by 5.3%. This means that LE-YOLOv5 is much more lightweight while still providing excellent performance. We set up visualization experiments for multialgorithm comparative detection in a variety of complex road environments. The experimental results show that LE-YOLOv5 exhibits excellent robustness and reliability in complex road environments.

AB In this article, we study the size of strong basins of attractions for the non-convex sparse spike estimation problem. We first extend previous results to obtain a lower bound on the size of sets where gradient descent converges with a linear rate to the minimum of the non-convex objective functional. We then give an upper bound that shows that the dependency of the lower bound with respect to the number of measurements reflects well the true size of basins of attraction for random Gaussian Fourier measurements. These theoretical results are confirmed by experiments.

AB A core issue inherent to decision-making and path-planning tasks is managing the uncertainties in the motion of dynamic obstacles. Therefore, this article proposes a new decision-making and path-planning framework, based on game theory, that considers the multistate future actions of surrounding vehicles. First, multistate future actions of neighboring vehicles, whose driving styles vary, are estimated and fed into a decision-making module for risk assessment. Then, based on the Stackelberg game theory, the ego vehicle and the rear object vehicle are modeled as two players in the game, and their optimal decisions are obtained. In addition, the path-planning model incorporates a potential-field model that utilizes several potential functions to explain the varied styles and physical limitations of the surrounding vehicles. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control that is based on the outputs of the decision-making and constructed potential-field models. The results of simulation experiments that used designed scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method effectively manages various social interactions and generates safe and appropriate trajectories for autonomous vehicles. In addition, the simulation results demonstrate that considering multistate trajectories caused the decision-making and path-planning modules to be appropriate for unpredictable environmental conditions.
   This approach first estimates the multimodal trajectories of traffic agents, whose driving styles vary. Then, decision-making module considers the existing and intentional risk generating different constraints. Agents' optimal decisions are obtained through game theory and potential field models for simultaneously achieving well generalization and interpretation capabilities. Finally, the trajectory of the ego vehicle is obtained through model predictive control.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Graph-based neural networks and unsupervised pre-trained models are both cutting-edge text representation methods, given their outstanding ability to capture global information and contextualized information, respectively. However, both representation methods meet obstacles to further performance improvements. On one hand, graph-based neural networks lack knowledge orientation to guide textual interpretation during global information interaction. On the other hand, unsupervised pre-trained models imply rich semantic and syntactic knowledge which lacks sufficient induction and expression. Therefore, how to effectively integrate graph-based global information and unsupervised contextualized semantic and syntactic information to achieve better text representation is an important issue pending for solution. In this paper, we propose a representation method that deeply integrates Unsupervised Semantics and Syntax into heterogeneous Graphs (USS-Graph) for inductive text classification. By constructing a heterogeneous graph whose edges and nodes are totally generated by knowledge from unsupervised pre-trained models, USS-Graph can harmonize the two perspectives of information under a bidirectionally weighted graph structure and thereby realizing the intra-fusion of graph-based global information and unsupervised contextualized semantic and syntactic information. Based on USS-Graph, we also propose a series of optimization measures to further improve the knowledge integration and representation performance. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that USS-Graph consistently achieves state-of-the-art performances on inductive text classification tasks. Additionally, extended experiments are conducted to deeply analyze the characteristics of USS-Graph and the effectiveness of our proposed optimization measures for further knowledge integration and information complementation.

AB Traditional convolution neural networks (CNN) have achieved good performance in multi-organ segmentation of medical images. Due to the lack of ability to model long-range dependencies and correlations between image pixels, CNN usually ignores the information of channel dimension. To further improve the performance of multi-organ segmentation, a hybrid attention mechanism model is proposed. First, a CNN was used to extract multi-scale feature maps and fed into the Channel Attention Enhancement Module (CAEM) to selectively pay attention to target organs in medical images, and the Transformer encoded tokenized image patches from CNN feature maps as the input sequence to model long-range dependencies. Second, the decoder upsampled the output from Transformer and fused with the CAEM features in multi-scale through skip connections. Finally, we introduced a Refinement Module (RM) after the decoder to improve feature correlations of the same organ and the feature discriminability between different organs. The model outperformed on dice coefficient (%) and hd95 on both the synapse multi-organ segmentation and cardiac diagnosis challenge datasets. The hybrid attention mechanisms exhibited high efficiency and high segmentation accuracy in medical images.
   We design a hybrid attention mechanism networks to segment multi-organ in medical image. On the one hand, self-attention and channel attention are integrated to capture global and local features which adapt to the different contrast among organs; on the other hand, a refinement module refine is constructed to refine organ details to further optimize segmentation accuracy. Our model helps to identify organs and boundaries in medical images, significantly improving the segmentation accuracy of medical images.image

AB Unlike two-wheeled balancing robots, which are mechanically stable in one direction, unicycle robots use only one bottom wheel to maintain pitching balance, leaving the robot unable to maintain rolling balance. This study proposes an intelligent balancing control (IBC) system to address the highly nonlinear and underactuated behavior of the unicycle robot through the fuzzy control approach. The IBC system comprises three controllers: the fuzzy movement control (FMC), the fuzzy rolling control (FRC) and the fuzzy steering control (FSC). The FMC enables the unicycle robot to move at a desired speed in the longitudinal direction while maintaining balance, the FRC causes the roll angle to approach zero in the lateral direction, and the FSC controls the robot to rotate in place in the yaw direction. In addition, because the movement of bicycle robot is relatively complex, most of them only tend to simple movement patterns or linear movements. Further, this study proposes a trajectory tracking control (TTC) system using the fuzzy control approach to enable the bicycle robot to track a desired trajectory with high accuracy. Finally, the proposed control strategy is implemented using a 32-bit STM32F446RE microcontroller. Six experimental scenarios are studied to help test the robot's stability and maneuverability. The experimental results not only proved the balance of the IBC system in challenging terrain, but also proved the accuracy of the TTC system in tracking the command trajectory.

AB Image downscaling is an essential operation to reduce spatial complexity for various applications and is becoming increasingly important due to the growing number of solutions that rely on memory-intensive approaches, such as applying deep convolutional neural networks to semantic segmentation tasks on large images. Although conventional content-independent image downscaling can efficiently reduce complexity, it is vulnerable to losing perceptual details, which are important to preserve. Alternatively, existing content-aware downscaling severely distorts spatial structure and is not effectively applicable for segmentation tasks involving document images. In this paper, we propose a novel image downscaling approach that combines the strengths of both content-independent and content-aware strategies. The approach limits the sampling space per the content-independent strategy, adaptively relocating such sampled pixel points, and amplifying their intensities based on the local gradient and texture via the content-aware strategy. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we plug our adaptive downscaling method into a deep learning-based document image segmentation pipeline and evaluate the performance improvement. We perform the evaluation on three publicly available historical newspaper digital collections with differences in quality and quantity, comparing our method with one widely used downscaling method, Lanczos. We further demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method by using three different training scenarios: stand-alone, image-pyramid, and augmentation. The results show that training a deep convolutional neural network using images generated by the proposed method outperforms Lanczos, which relies on only content-independent strategies.

TI Dual adaptive training of photonic neural networks
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Photonic neural networks (PNNs) are remarkable analogue artificial intelligence accelerators that compute using photons instead of electrons at low latency, high energy efficiency and high parallelism; however, the existing training approaches cannot address the extensive accumulation of systematic errors in large-scale PNNs, resulting in a considerable decrease in model performance in physical systems. Here we propose dual adaptive training (DAT), which allows the PNN model to adapt to substantial systematic errors and preserves its performance during deployment. By introducing the systematic error prediction networks with task-similarity joint optimization, DAT achieves high similarity mapping between the PNN numerical models and physical systems, as well as highly accurate gradient calculations during dual backpropagation training. We validated the effectiveness of DAT by using diffractive and interference-based PNNs on image classification tasks. Dual adaptive training successfully trained large-scale PNNs under major systematic errors and achieved high classification accuracies. The numerical and experimental results further demonstrated its superior performance over the state-of-the-art in situ training approaches. Dual adaptive training provides critical support for constructing large-scale PNNs to achieve advanced architectures and can be generalized to other types of artificial intelligence systems with analogue computing errors.
   Despite their efficiency advantages, the performance of photonic neural networks is hampered by the accumulation of inherent systematic errors. Zheng et al. propose a dual backpropagation training approach, which allows the network to adapt to systematic errors, thus outperforming state-of-the-art in situ training approaches.

TI Cascading AB-YOLOv5 and PB-YOLOv5 for rib fracture detection in frontal
   and oblique chest X-ray images
SO IET COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE bone; computer vision; diseases
AB Convolutional deep learning models have shown comparable performance to radiologists in detecting and classifying thoracic diseases. However, research on rib fractures remains limited compared to other thoracic abnormalities. Moreover, existing deep learning models primarily focus on using frontal chest X-ray (CXR) images. To address these gaps, the authors utilised the EDARib-CXR dataset, comprising 369 frontal and 829 oblique CXRs. These X-rays were annotated by experienced radiologists, specifically identifying the presence of rib fractures using bounding-box-level annotations. The authors introduce two detection models, AB-YOLOv5 and PB-YOLOv5, and train and evaluate them on the EDARib-CXR dataset. AB-YOLOv5 is a modified YOLOv5 network that incorporates an auxiliary branch to enhance the resolution of feature maps in the final convolutional network layer. On the other hand, PB-YOLOv5 maintains the same structure as the original YOLOv5 but employs image patches during training to preserve features of small objects in downsampled images. Furthermore, the authors propose a novel two-level cascaded architecture that integrates both AB-YOLOv5 and PB-YOLOv5 detection models. This structure demonstrates improved metrics on the test set, achieving an AP30 score of 0.785. Consequently, the study successfully develops deep learning-based detectors capable of identifying and localising fractured ribs in both frontal and oblique CXR images.
   Two significant contributions are made. First, the authors propose two deep learning models, AB-YOLOv5 and PB-YOLOv5, capable of accurately detecting the location of rib fractures in both frontal and oblique chest X-ray images. These models enhance the detection capability for identifying fracture locations. Second, the authors propose a two-stage cascade detector that leverages a two-stage detection approach. This innovative method enables the detection of smaller fracture locations, ultimately leading to improved results.image

   learning; Noisy labels; Label correlations; Data augmentation
AB In partial multi-label learning (PML) problems, each training sample is partially annotated with a candidate label set, among which only a subset of labels are valid. The major hardship for PML is that its training procedure is prone to be misled by false positive labels concealed in the candidate label set. To train a noise-robust multi-label predictor for PML problem, most existing methods hold the assumption that sufficient training samples are available. However, in actual fact, especially when dealing with new tasks, we more often only have a few PML samples for the target task. In this paper, we propose a unified model called FsPML-SF (Few-shot Partial Multi-Label Learning with Synthetic Features Network). FsPML-SF includes three modules: label disambiguation, data augmentation and classifier induction. Specifically, FsPML-SF attempts to update the label credibility of each PML sample by leveraging the feature and semantic similarities, the label credibility of other samples and label co-occurrence in a unified objective function. Next, FsPML-SF introduces a synthetic feature network to generate more training samples from pairs of given samples with corresponding label credibility values. FsPML-SF then utilizes the original and synthesized samples to induce a noise-tolerant multi-label classifier. We conducted extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, FsPML-SF outperforms recent competitive PML baselines and few-shot solutions. Both the label denoising and data augmentation improve the performance of PML on few-shot data.

AB Highly sensitive pressure sensors, with a wide operating range, are needed in applications such as wearables, prostheses, and haptic-based interactive systems. Herein, fully 3D printed capacitive pressure sensors comprising polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam-based dielectric layer, sandwiched between the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate and silver nanowire-based electrodes, are presented. The printed electrodes exhibit excellent electrical properties (1.6 & omega; sq-1, 20.35 kS m-1) and bendability. Various ratios of PDMS to ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) are evaluated to obtain dielectric layer with optimum pore sizes for better performance and ease of fabrication. The device with a PDMS:NH4HCO3 ratio of 4:0.8 exhibits a linear response with a sensitivity of 0.0055 kPa-1 in the tested pressure range of 5-170 kPa. The fully 3D printed sensors also show excellent repeatability over 500 cycles with an average hysteresis of 1.53%, and fast response and recovery times of 89 and 195 ms, respectively. The superiority of the presented 3D printed foam-based device is confirmed by 30% higher sensitivity in comparison with PDMS-based sensors. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, the pressure sensors presented in this study are assessed for their suitability in underwater environments and touch-based object recognition.
   This study introduces fully 3D printed capacitive pressure sensors using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) foam as dielectric layer. The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate and silver nanowires electrodes provide exceptional flexibility and electrical properties. The optimized device shows about 30% higher sensitivity compared to the PDMS-based sensors. Further, the sensors offer good repeatability, fast response/recovery times. The sensors are evaluated for underwater pressure monitoring and touch-based object recognition.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

The fabricated FeTFT exhibits a highly linear conductance response (|& alpha;| = 0.21) with a large dynamic range (Gmax/Gmin & AP; 53.2), although identical program pulses are applied to the device. In addition, because the inner metal layer of the FeTFTs has an MFMIS structure, the electric field is uniformly applied to the entire IGZO channel, which reduces the cycle-to-cycle variation (& sigma; = 0.47%) in the conductance responses. In the system simulation with the measured synaptic characteristics, the high classification accuracy of & AP;97.0% is achieved in the MNIST image set, verifying the feasibility of FeTFT-based neuromorphic systems.

AB Dentistry diseases are worldwide concern with the fact that 5% of medical budget is spent on it. Dental diagnosis requires frequent visits to clinic and multiple personal check-ups by an expert. This delays the process of diagnosis as well as introduces the danger of oral infection spread. Automation is boon to speed up the process of diagnosis, reduce expert's involvement and help in handling volume of patients. In situations like pandemic as seen in this decade, computer based automatic systems in health have proven their importance and necessity. For dental diagnosis, images are useful tool for better anatomical views and accurate decision of treatment. However, manual dental analysis increases load on dentists for initial check-up that can be easily performed with automated systems or self-kits. Oral cavity is a dental illness, if not identified and treated on time may lead to other serious ailments. This work presents a framework that performs tooth image classification for cavity and non-cavity with new bag of features (NBoF) method. NBoF method is an attempt to improve the performance of bag of features (BoF) using the proposed reinforcement Aquila optimization (RAO) and weighted Bayesian Gaussian mixture modelling (WBGMM). An analysis of the performance of the NBoF using the proposed RAO and WBGMM is conducted using standard metrics. The comparative study of results proves that the proposed NBoF method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB Abnormal discharge (AD) is a discharge mode in electroencephalogram (EEG) with sharp outlines. Lack of related open-access datasets and insufficient annotation hamper the development of AD detection, while cognitive neuroscience, clinical research and pilots' neural screening demand stable and reliable AD detection methods. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference method for AD detection is proposed in this work. First, a probability-density-based (PD) method is proposed to extract lognormal amplitude features from EEG envelopes. Second, the subtractive clustering method (SCM) is modified so that clustering radii can adapt to cluster shapes for each dimension instead of using identical radii for each cluster. The outputs of modified SCM (mSCM), coordinates of cluster centers and adjusting rates for radius components are used to automatically initialize Gaussian membership functions of adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Finally, we conducted multiple experiments to validate mSCM-based ANFIS, comparing it with traditional machine learning classifiers (support vector machines, multi-layer perceptrons, deci-sion trees, and random forests) and the state-of-the-art deep learning-based time-series classification methods InceptionTime and Minirocket, using synthetic data, small-size datasets and a private EEG data-set. Results show that combining PD features with features proposed in previous studies, such as smoothed nonlinear energy operator features and discrete wavelet transform features, achieved higher accuracy (95.13 & PLUSMN; 0.86%) and recall (89.17 & PLUSMN; 3.06%) than other feature combinations. mSCM created more suitable cluster boundaries than SCM on small-size datasets, and its clustering results demonstrated potential in helping interpretation of classification rules built in the ANFIS network. Results of compar-ison experiments showed that mSCM-based ANFIS produced competitive results in accuracy and recall for AD detection, with lower computational cost, compared to the top 2 results obtained by InceptionTime and Minrocket.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

ID ATTACKS; DEFENSE
AB Adversarial training is the most popular and general strategy to improve Deep Neural Network (DNN) robustness against adversarial noises. Many adversarial training methods have been proposed in the past few years. However, most of these methods are highly susceptible to hyperparameters, especially the training noise upper bound. Tuning these hyperparameters is expensive and difficult for people not in the adversarial robustness research domain, which prevents adversarial training techniques from being used in many application fields. In this study, we propose a new adversarial training method, named Adaptive Margin Evolution (AME). Besides being hyperparameter-free for the user, our AME method places adversarial training samples into the optimal locations in the input space by gradually expanding the exploration range with self-adaptive and gradient-aware step sizes. We evaluate AME and the other seven well-known adversarial training methods on three common benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet) under the most challenging adversarial attack: AutoAttack. The results show that: (1) On the three datasets, AME has the best overall performance; (2) On the Tiny ImageNet dataset, which is much more challenging, AME has the best performance at every noise level. Our work may pave the way for adopting adversarial training techniques in application domains where hyperparameter-free methods are preferred.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the bipartite consensus tracking control problem with full-state constraints for p-norm multiagent systems. For the full-state constraints problem of p-norm multiagent systems, a transformed function is utilized to achieve the objective of the constraints, which has the property of low complexity because it avoids the intervention of log-type functions or trigonometric functions in the controllers. Meanwhile, the bipartite control performance of p-norm multiagent systems is also guaranteed. Moreover, under the simplified reinforcement learning framework, a compensation strategy is utilized to compensate the unknown ideal weights caused by the simplified reinforcement learning algorithm of critic-actor method, and greatly improve the accuracy of the tracking performance for p-norm multiagent systems. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is illustrated by an actual simulation.

AB Fully distributed secure consensus control of nonlinear multiagent systems under communication link attacks is achieved, where the design criteria are independent of the Laplacian matrix related to the communication topology and its corresponding eigenvalues. Firstly, this article proposes an edge-based fully distributed adaptive protocol for leaderless nonlinear multiagent systems with communication link attacks to achieve secure consensus control, where the interaction strengths between neighboring agents are adaptively adjusted on the foundation of the transmitted relative states to counteract influences of communication link attacks. Then, the problem of secure consensus control for leaderless nonlinear multiagent systems with communication link attacks is transformed into the stability of secure consensus error systems, and sufficient conditions for leaderless nonlinear multiagent systems achieving fully distributed secure consensus control are given. Furthermore, main results for leaderless nonlinear multiagent systems are extended to leader-following cases. Finally, theoretical results are verified by two numerical examples.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Drawing from memory the face of a friend you have not seen in years is a difficult task. However, if you happen to cross paths, you would easily recognize each other. The biological memory is equipped with an impressive compression algorithm that can store the essential, and then infer the details to match perception. The Willshaw Memory is a simple abstract model for cortical computations which implements mechanisms of biological memories. Using our recently proposed sparse coding prescription for visual patterns [34], this model can store and retrieve an impressive amount of real-world data in a faulttolerant manner. In this paper, we extend the capabilities of the basic Associative Memory Model by using a Multiple-Modality framework. In this setting, the memory stores several modalities (e.g., visual, or textual) of each pattern simultaneously. After training, the memory can be used to infer missing modalities when just a subset is perceived. Using a simple encoder-memory-decoder architecture, and a newly proposed iterative retrieval algorithm for the Willshaw Model, we perform experiments on the MNIST dataset. By storing both the images and labels as modalities, a single Memory can be used not only to retrieve and complete patterns but also to classify and generate new ones. We further discuss how this model could be used for other learning tasks, thus serving as a biologically-inspired framework for learning.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

ID NETWORKS
AB Contrastive learning has made breakthrough advancements in graph representation learning, which encourages the representation of positive samples to be close and those of negative samples to be far away. However, existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) frameworks have made great efforts toward designing different augmentation strategies for positive samples, while randomly utilizing all other nodes as negative samples and treating them equally, completely ignoring the differences between negative samples. Moreover, almost every GCL framework replaces original graph with different augmented views, which may lead to unexpected information missing caused by randomly perturbing edges and features. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised graph Contrastive learning framework with Curriculum negative sampling, called ConCur, which feeds negative samples in an easy-to-hard fashion for contrastive learning by performing our proposed curriculum negative sampling strategy. More specif-ically, ConCur consists of two phases: Graph Augmentations and Curriculum Contrastive Training. Graph Augmentations aim at constructing positive and negative samples through different graph augmentation strategies. In the Curriculum Contrastive Training, we first utilize a triplet network to learn node repre-sentations by receiving original graph and different augmented views as input. Then, we propose a cur-riculum negative sampling strategy to enumerate negative samples from easy to hard for contrastive training. Finally, we utilize a unified contrastive loss to optimize node representations. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets reveal that ConCur yields substantial relative encouraging results on the node classification task.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper examines a private distributed online convex optimization problem in which each agent strives to minimize the sum of objective functions while also tending to keep their individual objective functions confidential. We use differential privacy as the metric to safeguard each agent's privacy and offer a distributed online mirror descent technique that is differentially private. We demonstrate that for strongly convex objective functions, our proposed algorithm satisfies the expected regret bound of O(ln (T)) while maintaining differential privacy, where T is the number of iterations. The established expected regret bound matches the optimal theoretical regret bound with respect to T. We further illu-minate the trade-off between the extent of privacy-preserving and the expected regret bound through numerical simulations.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Ice-hockey puck tracking is a non-trivial task in hockey video analysis as it highlights the puck in the video for broadcasting, tactical play analysis, or referee assisting. However, difficulties, such as high speed, low texture features in images and constantly changing shape, make well-developed object tracker fail to track the puck. This paper introduces a real-time online-learning ice hockey puck detection and tracking system solely depending on video input to tackle this problem. The proposed approach categorizes pucks into free-moving and control-moving states, using a combination of contour fitting, correlation filter, and motion estimation techniques to detect and track them. A thorough analysis is performed focusing on the tracking scenario using broadcast video. To our knowledge, this is the first approach addressing detection and tracking nearly invisible high-speed pucks when shooting actions take place. Experiments with a comparison between a previous work targeting puck tracking show promising results in detection and tracking the ice hockey puck through broadcast video. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Communication recovery is necessary for rescue and reconstruction scenarios including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, etc. The rapid and stable communication link can provide efficient victims' real-time information for the rescue process. However, traditional centralized communication links cannot traverse the further victims with information-sharing requirements. And the even communication link distribution leads to a load burden on the crowded victim area. Thus, we propose a three-layer architecture consisting of the emergency communication vehicle, backbone links, and branch links to rapidly recover communication via mobile robots. Then, considering victims' distribution, an improved MaxMin distance algorithm is presented as the basis of robot dispatch. The relay probability of the link is also estimated with closed formulae. Finally, simulation results verify that our proposed algorithm can recover communication with lower delay and higher packet delivery ratio.

AB The paper proposes an innovation method of integrating a multi-agent reinforcement learning and 3D A* search, <MARL, A*>, to tackle the facility layout problem with the goal of minimizing connector-assembly cost, including wires and pipes, in a finite three-dimensional space subjected to complex constraints. The mathematical model is established through the bounding boxes and grids, and an improved 3D A* algorithm is used to evaluate the route quality of connectors. After defining facility states in the ranking way, the position and orientation of each facility are iteratively solved by the multi-agent reinforcement learning, Wolf Policy Hill-Climbing (Wolf-PHC), with three actions of horizontal movement, rotation and swap. Then a pure water manufacturing system has been taken as a case to carry out a series of combination comparative experiments with other approaches (Dijkstra; Ant colony optimization; Genetic algorithm) used in the relevant literatures and the parameter values of these approaches have been sampled by Latin Hypercube. The results show that the stability, efficiency and solving quality of <MARL, A*> are better.

AB Ensemble classifiers have been investigated by many in the artificial intelligence and machine learning community. Majority voting and weighted majority voting are two commonly used combination schemes in ensemble learning. However, understanding of them is incomplete at best, with some properties even misunderstood. In this paper, we present a group of properties of these two schemes formally under a geometric framework. Two key factors, every component base classifier's performance and dissimilarity between each pair of component classifiers are evaluated by the same metric-the Euclidean distance. Consequently, ensembling becomes a deterministic problem and the performance of an ensemble can be calculated directly by a formula. We prove several theorems of interest and explain their implications for ensembles. In particular, we compare and contrast the effect of the number of component classifiers on these two types of ensemble schemes. Some important properties of both combination schemes are discussed. And a method to calculate the optimal weights for the weighted majority voting is presented. Empirical investigation is conducted to verify the theoretical results. We believe that the results from this paper are very useful for us to understand the fundamental properties of these two combination schemes and the principles of ensemble classifiers in general. The results are also helpful for us to investigate some issues in ensemble classifiers, such as ensemble performance prediction, diversity, ensemble pruning, and others.

AB The main challenge in addressing constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) lies in achieving a balance among convergence, diversity, and feasibility. To address this issue, this paper proposes a constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with Pareto estimation via neural network named CMOEA-PeNN. In order to exploit and explore the decision space, the proposed algorithm employs a dual-population mechanism, which is trained with a self-organizing map (SOM). Firstly, the population distribution structure in decision space is mapped to objective space while preserving neighborhood information, and then the neuron weight is utilized to estimate the Pareto front (PF). Secondly, a novel approach is devised to preserve the feasibility of the population and enhance the estimation of the Pareto front by SOM. The achievement scalarizing function (ASF) is employed to choose promising solutions. This strategy could guide the population toward the optimal solution while exploring the small feasible regions. Finally, the performance of CMOEA-PeNN is compared with five stateof-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (CMOEAs) on three widely used benchmark problems and a real-world problem. The experimental results show that CMOEA-PeNN could archive competitive performance in solving CMOPs.

TI Global and local neural cognitive modeling for student performance

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Knowledge tracing; Cognitive diagnosis; Student performance prediction;
   Student modeling
AB Student performance prediction is a critical task in supporting decision-making for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Correct predictions of student performance are prerequisites for ITS to supply intelligent services and optimize learning efficiency, e.g., recommending the most appropriate learning resources for each student. Existing methods mainly include cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing, both of which focus on students' cognitive modeling based on their interactions on a sequence of items and give predictions by assessing if their cognitive states can meet the item requirements. Specifically, cognitive diagnosis only considers students' global static cognitive states, while knowledge tracing focuses on students' local dynamics. However, both global and local features are critical for predicting student performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Global and Local Neural Cognitive (GLNC) model to capture both global and local features in student item interactions for more accurate predictions. Specifically, we first learn students' global cognitive level according to all student-item interactions. Then, we propose a self-attentive encoder based on the scaled dot product attention mechanism to extract the local cognitive dynamics and the dependencies between students' recent interactions. Finally, to obtain better predictions, we design a fused gate based on the similarity between students' recently responded items and the item to be predicted to adaptively combine the global and local features. To evaluate the effectiveness of GLNC, we compare it with both cognitive diagnosis and knowledge tracing methods. All experiments are conducted on three public datasets that contain real student item interactions on mathematics or language courses from various ITS. The experimental results demonstrate that GLNC achieves an average score of 0.7810 on the AUC metric, 0.7627 on the ACC metric, 0.3987 on the RMSE metric, 0.2023 on the r2 metric, respectively achieving an average improvement of 1.84%, 1.07%, 1.87%, and 11.38% in contrast to existing state-of-the-art methods (i.e., NCD and LPKT). Moreover, we further analyze the performance of GLNC under different probabilities of guessing and slipping, the results indicate that GLNC is more robust against the influence of noisy data while considering both global and local features. Benefiting from the superior accuracy and stability, our proposed GLNC has a wide range of potential implications for ITS, which can be easily applied to improve students' learning efficiency and experience.

AB Flatness deviations in the tandem cold-rolling process of steel strips have a direct impact on product quality and shape, leading to strip breakage, reduced working speed, and equipment damage. However, conventional physics-based numerical models are inadequate for accurately predicting flatness in the complex operating conditions and variables of tandem rolling environments. To address this challenge, a novel approach is proposed that utilizes deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) based on real industrial data from tandem cold rolling. The multi-input and multi-output architecture of our DCNNs enables them to solve the multi-level nonlinear problem associated with flatness prediction in the tandem cold-rolling process. The flatness profiles are effectively predicted using the proposed method, incorporating multiple variables without requiring additional data pre-processing methods. Additionally, the effects of network width, depth, and topology on flatness prediction performance are thoroughly investigated. The developed Inception-ResNet demonstrates remarkable predictive performance while using fewer model parameters and exhibiting lower computational complexity compared to other network architectures. Specifically, the proposed Inception-ResNet-39 model, consisting of 39 layers of learnable parameters, achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance. Our deep learning-based approach accurately predicts flatness in tandem cold-rolling through end-to-end modeling and provides complete pipelines for model transfer construction to ensure efficient implementation.

AB As an efficient information retrieval technique, cross-modal hashing has received increasing attention. However, the remaining challenges include (1) designing effective kernelization techniques to sufficiently strengthen the connections among different samples in kernel space and improve the class separability of data; (2) learning robust compact common representations to fully extract the correlation information between different modalities; and (3) fully leveraging underlying semantic information and embedding it into optimal hash codes. To conquer these challenges, we propose a novel algorithm called Asymmetric Low-rank Double -level Cooperation Hashing (ALDCH). First, we propose a novel Nonlinear Normalized Space Kernelization submodule (NNSK) to obtain the high-quality kernelized features, which can not only capture the more powerful nonlinear structure representations but also better express the nonlinear intra-modal correlations among the original features. To learn high-quality compact representations, we further propose a novel Low-rank Double-level Cooperation Mapping submodule (LDCM) with the L21-norm constraint, which can enhance the correlation of the coefficient spaces from different modalities and enable the samples to learn constrained and compact hash representations. Besides, our proposed method fully utilizes the underlying semantic label information by introducing the Semantic Pairwise Correlation Learning submodule (SPCL). Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of ALDCH, which outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.

AB This article describes our study on the alignment of two complementary knowledge graphs useful in agriculture: the thesaurus of cultivated plants in France named French Crop Usage (FCU) and the French national taxonomic repository TAXREF for fauna, flora, and fungi. FCU describes the usages of plants in agriculture: "tomatoes" are crops used for human food, and "grapevines" are crops used for human beverage. TAXREF describes biological taxa and associated scientific names: for example, a tomato species may be "Solanum lycopersicum" or a grapevine species may be "Vitis vinifera". Both knowledge graphs contain vernacular names of plants but those names are ambiguous. Thus, a group of agricultural experts produced some mappings from FCU crops to TAXREF taxa. Moreover, new RDF properties have been defined to declare those new types of mapping relations between plant descriptions. The metadata for the mappings and the mapping set are encoded with the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM), a new model which, among other qualities, offers means to report on provenance of particular interest for this study. The produced mappings are available for download in Recherche Data Gouv, the federated national platform for research data in France.

AB Time series is a common type of data that widely exists in various real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow data, network KPI, financial data, which can be regarded as time series. Anomaly detection in time series is an interesting research topic with a wide range of real-world applications, such as network intrusion detection, traffic situation monitoring and sensor error detection. In the real-world scenario, the frequency of anomalies is very low and little anomalous sample is available for analysis. Therefore, unsupervised methods are usually used for anomaly detection. In this paper, based on spectrum analysis and time series decomposition, an unsupervised deep framework for anomaly detection in time series data is designed. First, we decompose the original time series into trend series, seasonal series and residual series based on spectrum analysis. Then, prediction models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed to predict the trend series and seasonal series, respectively, and the residual series is reconstructed based on a Gaussian distribution. Next, the time series data are reconstructed by superimposing the predicted trend series and seasonal series and reconstructed residual series. Finally, we compare the original time series with the reconstructed time series and detect anomalies according to a certain threshold. The method proposed in this paper integrates prediction-based and reconstruction-based methods, and the experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of our method.

AB Video question answering (VideoQA) is a challenging video understanding task that requires a comprehensive understanding of multimodal information and accurate answers to related questions. Most existing VideoQA models use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture temporal-spatial interactions between objects. Despite achieving certain success, we argue that current schemes have two limitations: (i) existing graph-based methods require stacking multi-layers of GNN to capture high-order relations between objects, which inevitably introduces irrelevant noise; (ii) neglecting the unique self-supervised signals in the high-order relational structures among multiple objects that can facilitate more accurate QA. To this end, we propose a novel Multi-scale Self-supervised Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MSHCL) framework for VideoQA. Specifically, we first segment the video from multiple temporal dimensions to obtain multiple frame groups. For different frame groups, we design appearance and motion hyperedges based on node semantics to connect object nodes. In this way, we construct a multi-scale temporal-spatial hypergraph to directly capture high-order relations among multiple objects. Furthermore, the node features after hypergraph convolution are injected into a Transformer to capture the global information of the input sequence. Second, we design a self-supervised hypergraph contrastive learning task based on the node- and hyperedge-dropping data augmentation and an improved question-guided multimodal interaction module to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the VideoQA model. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MSHCL compared with stat-of-the-art methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Specular highlights in images pose a significant challenge in algorithms for image segmentation, object detection and other image-based decision-making systems. However, most systems ignore this particular scenario and neglect input images with specular highlights instead of mitigating it in the pre-processing stage. In this paper, we leverage deep neural networks and take advantage of the varying illumination information in polarimetric images for synthesizing specular-free images. We propose a multi-domain Specular Highlight Mitigation Generative Adversarial Network (SHMGAN) with self-attention. SHMGAN consists of a single generator-discriminator pair trained simultaneously using polarimetric images. The proposed GAN uses a dynamically generated attention mask based on a specularity segmentation network without requiring additional manual input. The network is able to learn the illumination variation between the four polarimetric images and a pseudo-diffuse image. Once trained, SHMGAN is able to generate specular-free images from a single RGB image as input; without requiring any additional external labels. The proposed network is trained and tested publicly available datasets of real-world images. SHMGAN is able to accurately identify the specularity affected pixels and generates high visual quality images with mitigated specular reflections. The generated images are realistic and have very low noise, distortions and aberrations compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods for specular highlight removal.

AB Human motion prediction is crucial for the human-robot inter-action and self-driving. We human beings learn an action with two stages, i.e., the approximation stage and the adjustment stage. While the first stage learns an approximate pose in general, the second stage learns more details. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a new two-stage framework to predict the upcoming human motion poses progressively based on a historical sequence. In the approximation stage, we adopt the motion attention network to derive an approximation of the upcoming poses. In the adjustment stage, we propose a novel fine-tuning network that can extract both spatial and temporal features to enhance the prediction accuracy. To imitate the action learning procedure of our humans, the adjustment stage in our progressive prediction framework continuously adjusts the pose many times via a series of fine-tuning networks. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW) show that our proposed method can outperform state-of-the-art methods in both short-term and long-term predictions.

AB In this study, we investigate the dynamic energy-scheduling problem of a prosumer (producer/ consumer) with an energy storage device (EDS) and elastic loads. The goal is to develop efficient real-time scheduling strategies for prosumers, and to minimise their total long-term costs (i.e. cost of energy purchased from the external grid and depreciation cost of the EDS). The challenges are twofold: the uncertainty of the energy output of the prosumer and the time-coupling constraints of the EDS and elastic loads. To address these challenges, we first describe the dynamic energy-scheduling problem as a Markov decision process. Then, an approximate state dual-agent Q-learning algorithm is proposed to solve the optimal dynamic scheduling problem by improving the model-free reinforcement learning(RL) method. Compared with the traditional RL method, the proposed algorithm reduces the system-state dimensions and exhibits improved performance. The proposed algorithm can only be assisted by mutual interactions between the environment with a reward feedback mechanism to dynamically respond to uncertain changes in the environments, without modelling or predicting the system environments. Finally, extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces are conducted to study the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the total cost of the prosumer by up to 6.3%, 11.7% and 22.4% compared with the traditional RL method, Lyapunov optimisation and greedy algorithm, respectively.

   Sweetimator; Sweet-enhanced estimators
AB Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search has garnered attention due to its training-free nature and rapid search speed. However, existing zero-shot estimators commonly suffer from low consistency, which hampers their practicality. In this work, we theoretically analyze that network generalization and convergence are highly correlated with Sweet Gradient of Parameter, i.e., the number of parameters whose gradient absolute values are within a certain interval. Empirical results indicate that Sweet Gradient of Parameter brings a higher consistency than the overall number of parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate a positive correlation between the network depth and the proportion of parameters with sweet gradients in each layer. Based on the analysis, we propose a training-free method to find the Sweet Gradient interval and obtain an estimator, named Sweetimator. Furthermore, Sweet Gradient can be an effective and general approach to promote the consistency of zero-shot estimators. Experiments show that Sweetimator and Sweet-enhanced estimators have significant consistency improvement in multiple benchmarks. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 256x speedup in NAS-Bench-201 and maintains high competitiveness in DARTS, MobileNet, and Transformer search spaces.

   Short-term motion-appearance dynamics
AB As a pixel-wise dense forecast task, video prediction is challenging due to its high computation complexity, dramatic future uncertainty, and extremely complicated spatial-temporal patterns. Many deep learning methods are proposed for the task, which bring up significant improvements. However, they focus on modeling short-term spatial-temporal dynamics and fail to sufficiently exploit long-term ones. As a result, the methods tend to deliver unsatisfactory performance for a long-term forecast requirement. In this article, we propose a novel unified memory network (UNIMEMnet) for long-term video prediction, which can effectively exploit long-term motion-appearance dynamics and unify the short-term spatial-temporal dynamics and long-term ones in an architecture. In the UNIMEMnet, a dual branch multi-scale memory module is carefully designed to extract and preserve long-term spatial-temporal patterns. In addition, a short-term spatial-temporal dynamics module and an alignment and fusion module are devised to capture and coordinate short-term motion -appearance dynamics with long-term ones from our designed memory module. Extensive experiments on five video prediction datasets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios are conducted, which validate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method UNIMEMnet over state-of-the-art methods.

ID LOIHI
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown much promise as an energy-efficient alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs). Such methods trained by surrogate gradient (SG) descent are now capable of dealing with frame-or event-based vision tasks beyond classification (e.g. object detection, semantic segmentation). However, important questions about their behavior w.r.t fundamental design choices remain under-explored (e.g. how a specific neural coding scheme impacts the performance/robustness? Does a higher temporal latency necessarily imply better results?). In this paper, we focus on single object localization as a context to analyze deep convolutional SNNs on (1) the importance of temporal latency (i.e. the number of time-steps) on performance ; (2) their robustness against sensor corruptions ; and (3) the impact of neural coding schemes on performance with static images. We design a simple SNN baseline for frame-and event-based single object localization and compare it against a similar ANN architecture. Our experiments show that our approach can achieve competitive or better performance in accuracy and robustness against common sensor corruptions with significantly lower energy consumption. More importantly, our experimental analysis draws conclusions significantly different from well-known studies focused on SNNs trained with bio-plausible learning rules, which helps in the design of SG-trained architectures, and offers insight to design priorities in future neuromorphic technologies.

AB Automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems are highly vulnerable to synthetic speech attack. And the artifacts are the key spoofing clue to distinguish real and synthetic speech. In this paper, we focus on the detection of artifacts and proposed the twice attention networks (TA-networks). It is an end-to-end network which consists of feature extraction module and back-end classifier. The feature extraction module is the core of the TA-networks, and it is a twice attention Unet (TA-Unet). It contains two sequential attention modules: (1) a five-layer U-shaped network with attention gate to first obtain the general contour of artifacts and then (2) a softmax-based filter with adaptive coefficient to dynamically highlight the differences between different frequencies, and these differences can be regarded as elaborate artifacts. After the processing of the TA-Unet, the feature maps of real and synthetic speech are more discriminative for the back-end SCG-Res2Net50 classifier. Experimental results show that the TA-networks achieve equal error rates of 1.62% on ASVspoof 2019 logical access sub-challenge, and it is significantly better than most of the other experimental models.

DE Image retrieval; Deep hashing; Attention; Knowledge distillation
ID QUANTIZATION; CODES
AB Hashing has received broad attention in large-scale image retrieval due to its appealing efficiency in computation and storage. Particularly, with the drawn of deep learning, much efforts have been directed towards using deep neural networks to learn feature representations and hash codes simultaneously, and the developed deep hashing methods have shown superior performance over conventional hashing methods. In this paper, we propose Deep Attention Sampling Hashing (DASH), a novel deep hashing method that yields high-quality hash codes to enable efficient image retrieval. Specifically, we employ two sub-networks in DASH, i.e., a master branch and a part branch, to capture global structure features and discriminative feature representations, respectively. Furthermore, we develop an Attention Sampler Module (ASM), which consists of an Object Region Extraction (ORE) block and an Informative Patch Generation (IPG) block, to yield richer informative image patches. The ORE block provides a well-designed multi-scale attentional fusion mechanism to highlight and extract the significant regions of images, and the IPG block employs a direction -specific shift mechanism to generate desired image patches with discriminative details. Both blocks could be seamlessly integrated into various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Subsequently, we conduct knowledge distillation optimization to transfer the details learned by the part branch into the master branch to guide hash code learning. In addition, we design a Weibull quantization loss to minimize the information loss caused by binary quantization. The experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DASH with respect to different evaluation metrics.

SO NEUROCOMPUTING

DE Data imbalance; Image synthesis; Conditional GANs; Contrastive learning
AB Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) are well developed on balanced datasets as default standards for generating high-quality images of expected classes. However, the common problem in practice is that training datasets are imbalanced, and there is still a lack of clear conclusions of influences and solutions for imbalanced conditional image synthesis. In this paper, we first introduced a new baseline model by combining state-of-the-art CGANs with resampling and differentiable augmentation to revisit the imbalanced CGANs training. We demonstrate that class-confusion: Synthesized images mixing the attributes belonging to other classes, is the critical factor for low-quality results. To solve this, we proposed Style-Mix Assised Noise Distortion GAN (SandGAN), which explicitly learns style-controllable and style-uncontrollable features to alleviate the effect of data bias though: (i) A learnable selector layer to distort noise by combining features from noise or class-embedding for each class adaptively. (ii) An auxiliary contrastive loss constrains relative distances between sources and style-mix classes in the latent space. The style-mix-based contrastive loss assists in optimizing the distortion weights generated by the selector layer to improve the image quality and keep the intra-class diversity. Finally, experiments on imbalanced CIFAR-10, TinyImageNet and CUB-200 demonstrate that the proposed SandGAN reduces the effect of class confusion caused by data bias and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

DE Semantic textual similarity analysis; Residual network; Representational
   model; Interactive model; Data augmentation
AB Semantic textual similarity analysis is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing. Both representational and interactive models are extensively employed for this purpose. However, representational models often suffer from issues such as semantic defocus, semantic shift, and low accuracy. In contrast, interactive models can accurately capture the semantic focus of a text and extract ample semantic information, but hindered by high time costs and low retrieval efficiency. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Chinese Text Similarity Analysis model based on Residual Fusion (CTSARF). This model effectively implements the semantic feature fusion of representational and interactive models through a constant mapping method using residual networks. Therefore CTSARF can achieve both high accuracy and retrieval efficiency simultaneously. In this study, we employ the cosine-based loss function CoSENT and the fine-tuned pre-trained model Mengzi to optimize performance in text similarity analysis tasks. Additionally, we utilize a data augmentation method based on text editing to enhance the robustness of CTSARF when evaluating text similarity on unbalanced datasets. We conducted optimization comparison experiments, benchmark model comparison experiments, and ablation experiments of the CTSARF model on four Chinese datasets. The results demonstrate improvements in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores, thereby highlighting the necessity and superiority of the model fusion method based on residual networks.

ID VISUAL-ODOMETRY
AB 6DoF camera localization is an important component of autonomous driving and navigation. Deep learning has achieved impressive results in localization, but its robustness in dynamic environments has not been adequately addressed. In this paper, we propose a framework based on hybrid attention mechanism which can be generally applied to existing CNN-based pose regressors to improve their robustness in dynamic environments. Specifically, we propose a novel Transformer Bottleneck (TBo) block including convolution, channel attention, and a position-aware self-attention mechanism, which extracts more geometrically robust features by capturing the corresponding long-term dependencies between pixels. Furthermore, we introduce shuffle attention (SA) before the pose regressor, which integrates feature information in both spatial and channel dimensions, forcing the network to learn geometrically robust features, reducing the effects of dynamic objects and illumination conditions to improve camera localization accuracy. We evaluate our method on commonly benchmarked indoor and outdoor datasets and the experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve localization performance compared compare favorably to contemporary pose regressors schemes. In addition, extensive ablation evaluations are conducted to prove the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid attention bottleneck block for pose regression networks.

AB Deep learning has significantly advanced three-dimensional computer vision applied to point clouds. Never-theless, the substantial consumption of time, storage, and energy substantially limits its deployment on edge devices with constrained resources. Extremely low bit quantization has received wide attention due to its extremely high compression ratio, but the problem of a significant drop in accuracy cannot be ignored. To alleviate the obvious accuracy degradation for extreme low-bit quantization, this paper proposes a novel compression framework for binary and ternary neural networks applied to point clouds, which introduces in-formation geometry to model quantization to compensate the severe feature manifold distortion. It applies differential geometry on manifolds to study the implicit information of the point cloud feature data. Based on the theoretical analysis from the novel perspective of information geometry, two optimization modules are proposed to alleviate severe geometry distortions on differential manifolds. The first module, scaling recovery, provides layer-wise scaling parameters to reduce geometric distortion caused by quantization. The second module, Pooling Recovery, is specially designed to alleviate more severe pooling geometry distortions in point clouds. These two modules benefit both binary and ternary neural networks with ignored overheads. For ternary quantization, optimizations on convolution weights and gradients are additionally introduced. The proposed self -adaptive gradient estimation provides a more accurate approximation to the non-differential ternary staircase function. Convolution weight optimization is implemented on an information-geometry optimized model to achieve even higher accuracy and less memory consumption. Experimental results validate that the proposed models significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate better scalability.

AB Objective: This study develops new machine learning architectures that are more adept at detecting interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in scalp EEG. A comparison of results using the average precision (AP) metric is made with the proposed models on two datasets obtained from Baptist Hospital of Miami and Temple University Hospital. Methods: Applying graph neural networks (GNNs) on functional connectivity (FC) maps of different frequency sub-bands to yield a novel architecture we call FC-GNN. Attention mechanism is applied on a complete graph to let the neural network select its important edges, hence bypassing the extraction of features, a model we refer to as CA-GNN.Results: On the Baptist Hospital dataset, the results were as follows: Vanilla Self-Attention -> 0.9029 +/- 0.0431, Hierarchical Attention-* 0.8546 +/- 0.0587, Vanilla Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-> 0.92 +/- 0.0618, Satelight -> 0.9219 +/- 0.046, FC-GNN -> 0.9731 +/- 0.0187, and CA-GNN -> 0.9788 +/- 0.0125. In the same order, the results on the Temple University Hospital dataset are 0.9692, 0.9113, 0.97, 0.9575, 0.963, and 0.9879. Conclusion: Based on the good results they yield, GNNs prove to have a strong potential in detecting epileptogenic activity. Significance: This study opens the door for the discovery of the powerful role played by GNNs in capturing IEDs, which is an essential step for identifying the epileptogenic networks of the affected brain and hence improving the prospects for more accurate 3D source localization.

AB Accurately estimating object numbers plays a crucial role in industrial applications. However, object counting in computer vision poses a formidable challenge, particularly when dealing with images containing tiny, similar, and stacked objects. Therefore, this paper proposes an encoder-decoder-based convolutional neural network named AMSA-CAFF Net to accurately count and regress high-quality density maps from X-ray images of highly dense microscopic components. AMSA-CAFF Net has three major components: an adaptive multi-scale feature aggregation (AMSA) module for encoding adaptive multi-scale features in the encoder, a channel-wise adaptive feature fusion (CAFF) module to ensure smooth feature fusion, and a continuous feature enhancement mechanism to promote information integration in the decoder. In addition, there is still a lack of datasets dedicated to industrial object counting tasks. To address the limitations associated with the existing datasets, we construct a novel and large-scale object counting dataset named X-ray-based industrial electronic component counting dataset (XRAY-IECCD), consisting of 1,460 X-ray images of 10 types of components, resulting in a total of 2,915,126 objects annotated with points. To the best of our knowledge, the XRAY-IECCD is the first dataset of tiny, dense, multi-class object counts with a substantial number of annotations. We evaluate the performance of AMSA-CAFF Net on three datasets: the XRAY-IECCD, crowd counting benchmark ShanghaiTech dataset, and object counting benchmark CARPK dataset. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches over the proposed XRAY-IECCD and CARPK datasets, highlighting its effectiveness. Furthermore, we achieve competitive results on the ShanghaiTech dataset, which demonstrates the generalization capability of our method.

AB Artificial Intelligence applications gradually move outside the safe walls of research labs and invade our daily lives. This is also true for Machine Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligence's decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human-as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the taxonomy. Finally, research gaps in the field of Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs are identified for future research.

AB The well-known H. control design gives robustness to a controller by rejecting perturbations from the external environment, which is difficult to do for completely unknown affine nonlinear systems. Accordingly, the immediate objective of this paper is to develop an on-line real-time synergetic learning algorithm, so that a data-driven H. controller can be received. By converting the H. control problem into a two-player zero-sum game, a model-free Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation (MF-HJIE) is first derived using off-policy reinforcement learning, followed by a proof of equivalence between the MF-HJIE and the conventional HJIE. Next, by applying the temporal difference to the MF-HJIE, a synergetic evolutionary rule with experience replay is designed to learn the optimal value function, the optimal control, and the worst perturbation, that can be performed on-line and in real-time along the system state trajectory. It is proven that the synergistic learning system constructed by the system plant and the evolutionary rule is uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation results on an F16 aircraft system and a nonlinear system back up the tractability of the proposed method.

   generation; Text-to-image generation; Autoregressive generation
AB For autoregressive image generation, vector-quantized VAEs (VQ-VAEs) quantize image features with discrete codebook entries and reconstruct images from quantized features. However, they treat each codebook entry separately, which causes losses of image details. In this paper, we propose to reparameterize image features with weight vectors to treat all codebook entries as an entity, and present a novel dynamically vector quantized VAE (DVQ-VAE) to quantize reparameterized image features. Specifically, each image feature corresponds to a weight vector and we sum weighted codebook entries to obtain values of image features. In this way, image features can incorporate information from different codebook entries. Additionally, a novel continuous weight regularization loss is proposed to improve the reconstruction of image details. Our method achieves competitive results with prior state-of-the-art works for image generation and extensive experiments are conducted to take a deep insight into our DVQ-VAE.

AB In the forensic studies of painting masterpieces, the analysis of the support is of major importance. For plain weave fabrics, the densities of vertical and horizontal threads are used as main features, while angle deviations from the vertical and horizontal axis are also of help. These features can be studied locally through the canvas. In this work, deep learning is proposed as a tool to perform these local densities and angle studies. We trained the model with samples from 36 paintings by Velazquez, Rubens or Ribera, among others. The data preparation and augmentation are dealt with at a first stage of the pipeline. We then focus on the supervised segmentation of crossing points between threads. The U-Net with inception and Dice loss are presented as good choices for this task. Densities and angles are then estimated based on the segmented crossing points. We report test results of the analysis of a few canvases and a comparison with methods in the frequency domain, widely used in this problem. We concluded that this new approach successes in some cases where the frequency analysis tools fail, while improves the results in others. Besides, our proposal does not need the labeling of part of the to be processed image. As case studies, we apply this novel algorithm to the analysis of two pairs of canvases by Velazquez and Murillo, to conclude that the fabrics used came from the same roll.

AB Image compression has become an indispensable part of the digital world, reducing the costs of storing and transmitting high-quality images. Vector quantization method, which stands out among image compression methods, facilitates the storage and transmission of images without compromising image quality in the process of reducing their size. It uses a codebook to represent similar patterns in a set of images in this method. If the optimum codebook design is achieved, the loss in image quality is minimized by increasing the data compression ratio. It is efficient to use nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms in the optimization of complex and multidimensional problems such as optimum codebook generation in the image compression process. In this paper, Adolescent Identity Search Algorithm (AISA), which simulates the identity search process of adolescents, is designed for the first time of optimum codebook generation in the block-based image compression process. In addition, improved AISA with various modifications has been proposed to avoid the capture of the conventional AISA by local minimums and to customize the search space. The proposed improved AISA is compared with various well-known metaheuristic algorithms in the literature, and the visual and numerical results are evaluated on various metrics. Based on the simulation results, it has been shown that the proposed IAISA is more efficient than the other metaheuristic algorithms for block-based image compression.

AB Anomaly detection is vital in complex distributed systems. However, existing methods did not take into full account the temporal and spatial characteristics of data from multiple sources in the system. That will lead to less accurate of anomaly detection. To address this limitation, in this paper we propose a multi-source data based anomaly detection method through temporal and spatial characteristics. Specifically, we first considered the spatial characteristics. We propose a Transformer encoder to parse log templates and output template vectors, then an attention-based CNN is introduced to obtain the spatial characteristics from traces. Next, we considered the temporal characteristics. We propose Bi-LSTM network to obtain the temporal characteristics of multi-source data of the distributed systems, followed by anomaly detection. Finally, extensive comparative experiments verify the effectiveness of our method, the F1-score reaches 0.859 and improves by 2.14% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) with large-scale face images takes a significant amount of processing resources and the tuning/optimization time cost for face-based authentication. It must continue to improve its accuracy and speed during the matching phase. In this study, we propose a method, mu PEWFace, that inherits not only the benefits of recent DCNNs with adaptive loss functions, such as MagFace, ElasticFace, and AdaFace, for boosting accuracy but also the means to reduce matching time. Consequently, our method expands on the weighted voting mechanism that leverages suboptimal trained models to improve the discriminative capabilities of face-based authentication, as opposed to searching for the best optimal model. In order to boost the efficiency of face-based authentication, we also propose performing the matching phase for each model in parallel. To demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method, we conduct exhaustive experiments using a variety of well-known benchmarks, including LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB-30, CALFW, CPLFW, and IJB-B. The experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed method for face-based authentication achieves state-of-the-art results and exhibits remarkable performance.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article

   Deep learning
AB Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The EcoPort performance level serves as a basic indicator to determine the environmental status of a port and its achievement of certification standards. The European Sea Ports Organization has defined ten essential EcoPort criteria that contribute significantly to the assessment of EcoPort performance. The primary motivation for this study is to determine the importance of the criteria from the perspective of academics and chief officers, as well as to evaluate the EcoPort performance of six port authorities that comply with three basic certification standards for environmental management systems. The research methodology and application are conducted in four phases. In the first phase, experts, criteria, and alternative ports are identified. In the second phase, the importance levels of experts are determined using neutrosophic sets, while the criteria are weighted using the intuitionistic fuzzy weighting averaging operator. In the third phase, the alternative ranking order method ac-counting for two-step normalization (AROMAN) based on the intuitionistic fuzzy sets is introduced to evaluate the EcoPort performance of the ports. In the fourth phase, the results are supported by sensitivity analysis scenarios. The research results identified air pollution as the most critical criterion, while the Valencia Port Authority secured the highest rank in terms of EcoPort performance. Ultimately, this research contributes to the literature by developing and applying the new IF-AROMAN method for EcoPort performance evaluation.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of deep transfer learning methods, supervised methods, and semi-supervised methods in the context of protein fitness prediction, with a focus on small datasets. The analysis includes the exploration of the combination of different data sources to enhance the performance of the models. While deep learning and deep transfer learning methods have shown remarkable performance in situations with abundant data, this study aims to address the more realistic scenario faced by wet lab researchers, where labeled data is often limited. The novelty of this work lies in its examination of deep transfer learning in the context of small datasets and its consideration of semi-supervised methods and multi-view strategies. While previous research has extensively explored deep transfer learning in large dataset scenarios, little attention has been given to its efficacy in small dataset settings or its comparison with semi-supervised approaches. Our findings suggest that deep transfer learning, exemplified by ProteinBERT, shows promising performance in this context compared to the rest of the methods across various evaluation metrics, not only in small dataset contexts but also in large dataset scenarios. This highlights the robustness and versatility of deep transfer learning in protein fitness prediction tasks, even with limited labeled data. The results of this study shed light on the potential of deep transfer learning as a state-of-the-art approach in the field of protein fitness prediction. By leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on small datasets, researchers can achieve competitive performance surpassing traditional supervised and semi -supervised methods. These findings provide valuable insights for wet lab researchers who face the challenge of limited labeled data, enabling them to make informed decisions when selecting the most effective methodology for their specific protein fitness prediction tasks. Additionally, the study investigated the combination of two different sources of information (encodings) through our enhanced semi-supervised methods, yielding noteworthy results improving their base model and providing valuable insights for further research. The presented analysis contributes to a better understanding of the capabilities and limitations of different learning approaches in small dataset scenarios, ultimately aiding in the development of improved protein fitness prediction methods.

AB Reconstructing and segmenting cortical surfaces from MRI is essential to a wide range of brain analyses. However, most approaches follow a multi-step slow process, such as a sequential spherical inflation and registration, which requires considerable computation times. To overcome the limitations arising from these multi-steps, we propose SEGREcoN, an integrated end-to-end deep learning method to jointly reconstruct and segment cortical surfaces directly from an MRI volume in one single step. We train a volume-based neural network to predict, for each voxel, the signed distances to multiple nested surfaces and their corresponding spherical representation in atlas space. This is, for instance, useful for jointly reconstructing and segmenting the white-to-gray-matter interface and the gray-matter-to-CSF (pial) surface. We evaluate the performance of our surface reconstruction and segmentation method with a comprehensive set of experiments on the MindBoggle, ABIDE and OASIS datasets. Our reconstruction error is found to be less than 0.52 mm and 0.97 mm in terms of average Hausdorff distance to the FreeSurfer generated surfaces. Likewise, the parcellation results show over 4% improvements in average Dice with respect to FreeSurfer, in addition to an observed drastic speed-up from hours to seconds of computation on a standard desktop station.

AB Osteoporosis is a prevalent bone disease that causes fractures in fragile bones, leading to a decline in daily living activities. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and quantitative computed tomography (QCT) are highly accurate for diagnosing osteoporosis; however, these modalities require special equipment and scan protocols. To frequently monitor bone health, low-cost, low-dose, and ubiquitously available diagnostic methods are highly anticipated. In this study, we aim to perform bone mineral density (BMD) estimation from a plain X-ray image for opportunistic screening, which is potentially useful for early diagnosis. Existing methods have used multi-stage approaches consisting of extraction of the region of interest and simple regression to estimate BMD, which require a large amount of training data. Therefore, we propose an efficient method that learns decomposition into projections of bone-segmented QCT for BMD estimation under limited datasets. The proposed method achieved high accuracy in BMD estimation, where Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.880 and 0.920 were observed for DXA-measured BMD and QCT-measured BMD estimation tasks, respectively, and the root mean square of the coefficient of variation values were 3.27 to 3.79% for four measurements with different poses. Furthermore, we conducted extensive validation experiments, including multi-pose, uncalibrated-CT, and compression experiments toward actual application in routine clinical practice.

AB The rapid advancement of emerging technologies in the information age has resulted in intricate, diverse, and rapidly changing user requirements, thereby reducing the effectiveness of traditional requirement development approaches. This paper proposes a multi-layer heterogeneous network-based method for product requirement development to identify key requirements in the product development process and address the complex relationships among users, requirements, products, and requirement development teams. By incorporating the theory of hesitant fuzzy into the expert decision-making process, this method constructs four single-layer networks: user attention network, expert trust network, requirement correlation network, and component combination network, which assigns realistic significance to nodes in each network layer and establishes connections between different networks, forming a multi-layer heterogeneous network model for product requirement development. Furthermore, this paper defines indicators such as layer significance and node comprehensive significance and proposes a calculation method for node comprehensive significance based on biased random walk, which enables deep integration of node's realistic significance and topological centrality. The proposed method is applied to a data experiment of product requirement development for a specific type of new energy vehicle. By analyzing the calculation results of node comprehensive significance, high-quality recommendations are provided for the development team from the perspectives of functional requirements, product components, and user groups. Moreover, comparative experiments to assess algorithm performance demonstrate that the average accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 0.95, which is significantly higher than that of the commonly used single-layer network node centrality measurement methods and recently proposed multi -layer network node centrality measurement methods. These results reflect the advancement and applicability of the proposed method in product development scenarios.

AB Waste management contributes in various fields for global development. A multi-objective waste management (MOWM) problem is devised in an area that generates commercial, industrial and residential waste items. The target is to reduce the negative impact of waste items on social, economical and environmental sites by completing a closed-loop MOWM through a vehicle routing problem under time window restriction. This MOWM problem is optimizing the objectives including maximum profit, minimum carbon emission under carbon cap-and-trade policy, and minimum work load deviation to maintain the sustainability. Here, neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy (NHF) environment is preferred to overcome the hesitancy of MOWM problem. A new ranking approach is initiated for defuzzifying NHF data. The appropriateness of the formulated model is justified by evaluating two realistic applications. To derive the Pareto-optimal solution of the proposed MOWM problem, two fuzzy techniques, namely, neutrosophic linear programming and neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy programming, and one non-fuzzy technique global criterion method are utilized in NHF environment. The obtained Pareto-optimal solutions are compared by TOPSIS for determining the final Pareto-optimal solution and to select a better approach among the proposed three approaches. Comparison analysis, sensitivity analysis, managerial insights and conclusions with future research scopes are outlined at the end.

AB The exponential growth of the internet and inter-connectivity has resulted in an extensive increase in network size and the corresponding data, which has led to numerous novel attacks that pose significant challenges to network security. However, conventional network security approaches predominantly rely on the metadata of network traffic, utilized in numeric form, which is becoming ineffective against new attacks that hide within the content of the traffic. Therefore, it raises the need for security systems to adapt to the changing dynamics of network attacks. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called SeNet-I that leverages computer vision capabilities to combine low-level features and develop a more abstract and high-level representation of network traffic without requiring feature engineering. The proposed approach utilizes the raw network traffic information and transforms it into serialized three-channel images, which are employed as input to a proposed deep concatenated convolutional neural network model. Additionally, SeNet-I can easily incorporate packet level information, which is often challenging for conventional approaches due to its high dimensionality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we tested SeNet-I on both packet-based and flow-based network traffic, comparing it with current state-of-the-art methods and different image-based approaches. With F1 scores of 96% and 83% achieved in the multi-class classification of flow-based and packet-based network intrusion detection, our proposed approach outperformed other existing methods in the literature. Lastly, we discussed the advantages and limitations of the proposed method.

AB Bistable composite shells with high storage efficiency have great potential applications in deployable space structures. This paper proposes a constrained vibration optimization approach for improving the bending -mode frequency of cantilevered bistable reeled composite shells (BRCS) with respect to fiber orientation angles using a machine learning (ML) method. First, the bistability and a specific coiled diameter are considered as constraints to classify the input data. The data set of the support vector regression (SVR) model is constructed based on the finite element (FE) simulation results, followed by constricted particle swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the bending-mode vibration frequency of a cantilevered BRCS. A 15.5% improvement of the vibration frequency with respect to the benchmark is achieved at a = 59.3 degrees and beta = 32.2 degrees, which maintains great consistency with published results. Additionally, the optimization approach based on ML is further utilized to improve the vibration frequency of BRCS subjected to constraints of constant arc length and coiled diameter. The vibration frequency is improved by 85.3% with respect to the benchmark shell with optimized parameters of R = 16 mm, y = 358 degrees, and the stacking laminate sequence of [60/80/0/-80/-60]. Evaluation and validation analyses of the ML model demonstrate that vibration optimization using ML yields high computing efficiency and accuracy. This optimization approach has great potential in real-life engineering applications.

AB Since the start of COVID-19, a fair amount of work has been undertaken by scholars around the world to model its progression. It became clear from the start of pandemic that its progression is affected by various factors within different communities. Subsequently, the necessary means and the range of measures used to effectively control the virus would vary from place to place. And we have been witness to different approaches adopted around the world to maintain the virus under check both in the short term and the long term. So, in this unexpected situation, it is a great challenge for the world health organization (WHO) to save the lives of COVID-19 patients. For this, several mathematical models have been made for better understanding the coronavirus contagion. Mostly, these models are based on classical integer-order derivative using real numbers which cannot capture the fading memory. Thus, in this unexpected situation, fuzzy sets (FSs) are considered due to their inherent capability to deal with uncertainty. Fuzzy sets (FSs) theory has the ability to manage uncertain situations. Thus, the goal of this research is to present newly mathematical methods based on complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets (CPyFSs) and their operators, namely complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric operator, and induced complex Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid geometric operator to reduce the spreading rate of COVID-19. At the end of the paper an illustrative example is constructed to show the effectiveness, reliability of the new techniques.

AB In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the selection and use of appropriate activation functions is of critical importance. It has been seen that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is widely used in many CNN models. Looking at the recent studies, it has been seen that some non-monotonic activation functions are gradually moving towards becoming the new standard to improve the performance of CNN models. It has been observed that some non-monotonic activation functions such as Swish, Mish, Logish and Smish are used to obtain successful results in various deep learning models. However, only a few of them have been widely used in most of the studies. Inspired by them, in this study, a new activation function named Gish, whose mathematical model can be represented by y=x & BULL;ln(2-e-ex)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$y=x\cdot ln(2-{e}<^>{{-e}<^>{x}})$$\end{document}, which can overcome other activation functions with its good properties, is proposed. The variable x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$x$$\end{document} is used to contribute to a strong regulation effect of negative output. The logarithm operation is done to reduce the numerical range of the expression (2-e-ex)\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$(2-{e}<^>{{-e}<^>{x}})$$\end{document}. To present our contributions in this work, various experiments were conducted on different network models and datasets to evaluate the performance of Gish. With the experimental results, 98.7% success was achieved with the EfficientNetB4 model in the MNIST dataset, 86.5% with the EfficientNetB5 model in the CIFAR-10 dataset and 90.8% with the EfficientNetB6 model in the SVHN dataset. The obtained performances were shown to be higher than Swish, Mish, Logish and Smish. These results confirm the effectiveness and performance of Gish.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid heuristic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and whale optimization algorithm (PSO-WOA), to solve a multi-objective optimization problem relating to point-to-point trajectory planning of space robots. First of all, the kinematics of the space robot is introduced, and the motion of each revolute joint of the manipulator is parameterized by Bezier curve. Then, contradictory objective functions are proposed, and the trajectory planning problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem. The pose of the end-effector at the end of motion is set as the primary objective. The base disturbance, execution time, and manipulability of the end-effector are also taken into account. Furthermore, self-collision avoidance during the motion is also considered. The trajectory planning problem finally comes down to finding an optimal parameter of the Bezier curve for each joint. We propose a novel hybrid PSO-WOA, which is supposed to take advantages of the best of both methods: the exploration feature of the WOA and exploitation feature of the PSO. In order to enhance the performance of the PSO-WOA, the good point set and levy flight stochastic steps are employed for the initialization and updating process, respectively. The proposed method is applied to generate an optimal trajectory for a redundant free-floating space robot. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO-WOA.

AB The dynamic landscape of public health occurrences presents a formidable challenge to the emotional well-being of college students, necessitating a precise appraisal of their mental health (MH) status. A pivotal metric in this realm is the Mental Health Assessment Index, a prevalent gauge utilized to ascertain an individual's psychological well-being. However, prevailing indices predominantly stem from a physical vantage point, neglecting the intricate psychological dimensions. In pursuit of a judicious evaluation of college students' mental health within the crucible of public health vicissitudes, we have pioneered an innovative metric, underscored by temporal perception, in concert with a hybrid clustering algorithm. This augmentation stands poised to enrich the extant psychological assessment index framework. Our approach hinges on the transmutation of temporal perception into a quantifiable measure, harmoniously interwoven with established evaluative metrics, thereby forging a novel composite evaluation metric. This composite metric serves as the fulcrum upon which we have conceived a pioneering clustering algorithm, seamlessly fusing the fireworks algorithm with K-means clustering. The strategic integration of the fireworks algorithm addresses a noteworthy vulnerability inherent to K-means-its susceptibility to converging onto local optima. Empirical validation of our paradigm attests to its efficacy. The proposed hybrid clustering algorithm aptly captures the dynamic nuances characterizing college students' mental health trajectories. Across diverse assessment stages, our model consistently attains an accuracy threshold surpassing 90%, thus outshining existing evaluation techniques in both precision and simplicity. In summation, this innovative amalgamation presents a formidable stride toward an augmented understanding of college students' mental well-being during times of fluctuating public health dynamics.

AB In all areas of business, employee attrition has a detrimental impact on the accuracy of profit management. With modern advanced computing technology, it is possible to construct a model for predicting employee attrition to minimize business owners' costs. Despite the reality that these types of models have never been evaluated under real-world conditions, several implementations were developed and applied to the IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset to evaluate how these models may be incorporated into a decision support system and their effect on strategic decisions. In this study, a Transformer-based neural network was implemented and was characterized by contextual embeddings adapting to tubular data as a computational technique for determining employee turnover. Experimental outcomes showed that this model had significantly improved prediction efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art models. In addition, this study pointed out that deep learning, in general, and Transformerbased networks, in particular, are promising for dealing with tabular and unbalanced data.

AB When a well-trained model learns a new class, the data distribution differences between the new and old classes inevitably cause catastrophic forgetting in order to perform better in the new class. This behavior differs from human learning. In this article, we propose a class incremental object detection method for remote sensing images to address the problem of catastrophic forgetting caused by distribution differences among different classes. First, we introduce a class similarity distillation (CSD) loss based on the similarity between new and old class prototypes, ensuring the model's plasticity to learn new classes and stability to detect old classes. Second, to better extract class similarity features, we propose a global similarity distillation (GSD) loss that maximizes the mutual information between the new class feature and old class features. Additionally, we present a region proposal network (RPN)-based method that assigns positive and negative labels to prevent mislearning issues. Experiments demonstrate that our method is more accurate for class incremental learning on public DOTA and DIOR datasets and significantly improves training efficiency compared to state-of-theart class incremental object detection methods.

AB Although human factors (e.g., cognitive functions, behaviors and skills, human error models, etc.) are key elements to improve software development productivity and quality, the role of software developers' emotions and their personality traits in software engineering still needs to be studied. A major difficulty is in assessing developers' emotions, leading to the classic problem of having difficulties understanding what cannot be easily measured. Existing approaches to infer emotions, such as facial expressions, self-assessed surveys, and biometric sensors, imply considerable intrusiveness on developers and tend to be used only during normal working periods. This article proposes to assess the feasibility of using social media posts (e.g., developers' posts on Twitter) to accurately determine the polarity of emotions of software developers over extended periods in a non-intrusive manner, allowing the identification of potentially abnormal periods of negative or positive sentiments of developers that may affect software development productivity or software quality. Our results suggested that Twitter data can serve as a valid source for accurately inferring the polarity of emotions. We evaluated 31 combinations of unsupervised lexicon-based techniques using a dataset with 79,029 public posts from Twitter from sixteen software developers, achieving a macro F1-Score of 0.745 and 76.8% of accuracy with the ensemble comprised of SentiStrength, Sentilex-PT, and LIWC2015_PT lexicons. Among other results, we found a statistically significant difference in tweets' polarities posted during working and non-working periods for 31.25% of the participants, suggesting that emotional polarity monitoring outside working hours could also be relevant. We also assessed the Big Five personality traits of the developers and preliminarily used them to ponder the polarities inferences. In this context, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion were frequently related to neutral and positive posts, while Neuroticism is associated with negative posts. Our results show that the proposed approach is accurate enough to constitute a simple and non-intrusive alternative to existing methods. Tools using this approach can be applied in real software development environments to support software team workers in making decisions to improve the software development process.

Drawing from the model of an idealized teamwork process, we discuss the teamwork requirements for successful human-AI teaming in interdependent and complex work domains, including e.g., responsiveness, situation awareness, and flexible decision-making. We emphasize the need for team-centered AI that aligns goals, communication, and decision making with humans, and outline the requirements for such team-centered AI from a technical perspective, such as cognitive competence, reinforcement learning, and semantic communication. In doing so, we highlight the challenges and open questions associated with its implementation that need to be solved in order to enable effective human-AI teaming.

Using hourly data from buildings at the University of Granada, we have examined their electricity demand and designed a model to predict energy consumption. Our proposal was conducted with the aid of time series techniques as well as the combination of artificial neural networks and clustering algorithms. Both approaches proved to be suitable for energy modelling although nonfuzzy models provided more variability and less robustness than fuzzy ones. Despite the relatively small difference between fuzzy and nonfuzzy estimates, the results reported in this study show that the fuzzy solution may be useful to enhance and enrich energy predictions.

AB In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the selection and use of appropriate activation functions is of critical importance. It has been seen that the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) is widely used in many CNN models. Looking at the recent studies, it has been seen that some non-monotonic activation functions are gradually moving towards becoming the new standard to improve the performance of CNN models. It has been observed that some non-monotonic activation functions such as Swish, Mish, Logish and Smish are used to obtain successful results in various deep learning models. However, only a few of them have been widely used in most of the studies. Inspired by them, in this study, a new activation function named Gish, whose mathematical model can be represented by y = x center dot ln(2 - e(-ex)), which can overcome other activation functions with its good properties, is proposed. The variable x is used to contribute to a strong regulation effect of negative output. The logarithm operation is done to reduce the numerical range of the expression (2 - e(-ex)). To present our contributions in this work, various experiments were conducted on different network models and datasets to evaluate the performance of Gish. With the experimental results, 98.7% success was achieved with the EfficientNetB4 model in the MNIST dataset, 86.5% with the EfficientNetB5 model in the CIFAR-10 dataset and 90.8% with the EfficientNetB6 model in the SVHN dataset. The obtained performances were shown to be higher than Swish, Mish, Logish and Smish. These results confirm the effectiveness and performance of Gish.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid heuristic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, and whale optimization algorithm (PSO-WOA), to solve a multi-objective optimization problem relating to point-to-point trajectory planning of space robots. First of all, the kinematics of the space robot is introduced, and the motion of each revolute joint of the manipulator is parameterized by Bezier curve. Then, contradictory objective functions are proposed, and the trajectory planning problem is transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem. The pose of the end-effector at the end of motion is set as the primary objective. The base disturbance, execution time, and manipulability of the end-effector are also taken into account. Furthermore, self-collision avoidance during the motion is also considered. The trajectory planning problem finally comes down to finding an optimal parameter of the Bezier curve for each joint. We propose a novel hybrid PSO-WOA, which is supposed to take advantages of the best of both methods: the exploration feature of the WOA and exploitation feature of the PSO. In order to enhance the performance of the PSO-WOA, the good point set and levy flight stochastic steps are employed for the initialization and updating process, respectively. The proposed method is applied to generate an optimal trajectory for a redundant free-floating space robot. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PSO-WOA.

AB This article investigates the event-triggered switching control (ETSC) of switched nonlinear time-delay systems (SNTDSs) with asynchronous switching. First, we study the input-to-state stability (ISS) and integral ISS (iISS) for SNTDSs with asynchronous switching, where switching instants are generated based on the designed event-triggered mechanism. Among existing works on the ETSC, systems behavior at event-triggered instants is neglected. In fact, whenever an event is triggered, the systems mode will jump suddenly such that a switch is imposed to the systems, leading to the change of subsystems. Moreover, asynchronous switching behavior may occur between the actual subsystem and its corresponding controller. These facts bring great challenges for the event-triggered mechanism design and ISS analysis. To tackle these problems, a new Lyapunov-based event-triggered mechanism with adjustable parameters is designed to establish the relationship between systems switches and event triggers, and exclude the Zeno phenomenon. The analysis of the asynchronous switching behavior can be implemented and some ISS and iISS criteria of SNTDSs are derived utilizing the merging switching technique. Finally, two numerical examples, including a practical stirred tank reactor system, are presented to show the validity of the proposed methods.

   relationship preservation (REpre)
AB Graph clustering, which learns the node representations for effective cluster assignments, is a fundamental yet challenging task in data analysis and has received considerable attention accompanied by graph neural networks (GNNs) in recent years. However, most existing methods overlook the inherent relational information among the nonindependent and nonidentically distributed nodes in a graph. Due to the lack of exploration of relational attributes, the semantic information of the graph-structured data fails to be fully exploited which leads to poor clustering performance. In this article, we propose a novel self-supervised deep graph clustering method named relational redundancy-free graph clustering (R(2)FGC) to tackle the problem. It extracts the attribute-and structure-level relational information from both global and local views based on an autoencoder (AE) and a graph AE (GAE). To obtain effective representations of the semantic information, we preserve the consistent relationship among augmented nodes, whereas the redundant relationship is further reduced for learning discriminative embeddings. In addition, a simple yet valid strategy is used to alleviate the oversmoothing issue. Extensive experiments are performed on widely used benchmark datasets to validate the superiority of our R(2)FGC over state-of-the-art baselines. Our codes are available at https://github.com/yisiyu95/R2FGC.

AB The classification problem for short time-window steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) is important in practical applications because shorter time-window often means faster response speed. By combining the advantages of the local feature learning ability of convolutional neural network (CNN) and the feature importance distinguishing ability of attention mechanism, a novel network called AttentCNN is proposed to further improve the classification performance for short time-window SSVEP. Considering the frequency-domain features extracted from short time-window signals are not obvious, this network starts with the time-domain feature extraction module based on the filter bank (FB). The FB consists of four sixth-order Butterworth filters with different bandpass ranges. Then extracted multimodal features are aggregated together. The second major module is a set of residual squeeze and excitation blocks (RSEs) that has the ability to improve the quality of extracted features by learning the interdependence between features. The final major module is time-domain CNN (tCNN) that consists of four CNNs for further feature extraction and followed by a fully connected (FC) layer for output. Our designed networks are validated over two large public datasets, and necessary comparisons are given to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed network. In the end, in order to demonstrate the application potential of the proposed strategy in the medical rehabilitation field, we design a novel five-finger bionic hand and connect it to our trained network to achieve the control of bionic hand by human brain signals directly.

AB In an era of unprecedented technological advancement, the power industry is undergoing a transformative evolution, particularly in intelligent power grid enterprises. The integration of cutting-edge information science and technology has ushered in a new era of automation, informatization, and intelligence within these enterprises. While this progression promises enhanced production, operation, and management capabilities, it also brings forth a daunting challenge: the effective governance of the burgeoning volumes of power data. This paper aims to conduct in-depth research on evaluating the effectiveness of data governance in power grid enterprises based on deep learning to integrate more closely with their business systems. The main objective is to provide effective and convenient intelligent services for decision-making within an innovative power grid enterprise management system and strengthen the data architecture of these enterprises in data management. First, the deep learning neural network's principle structure and training methods are introduced in detail and combined with the deep learning neural network. This is a different evaluation model for the data governance effectiveness of power grid enterprises based on penalty variable weight. The difference probability density of the power difference data series in the power grid is taken as the evaluation index. The evaluation model for the governance effectiveness of different data is modified. Build a different evaluation model of power grid enterprise data governance effectiveness based on punishment and weight change, comprehensively consider the extent to which the data volume of power grid abnormal data in power grid enterprises affects the evaluation of data governance effectiveness, and complete the assessment of power grid enterprise data governance effectiveness based on deep learning. Experimental results underscore the method's efficacy, demonstrating an exceptional accuracy rate of 94%. This empirical validation highlights the method's efficient evaluation process, offering invaluable technical support for enhancing power data management's consistency, precision, and reliability within power grid enterprises. Moreover, comparative analyses against other methodologies, including KNN, SVM, RF, DT, and RNN, reaffirm the superiority of the DNN model, solidifying its outstanding performance.

AB Cross-efficiency (CE) evaluation is an extension of the data envelopment analysis approach that allows decision making units (DMUs) to assess their peers by means of their own appreciation weights. As a result, each DMU is presented with a vector of CE scores, which need to undergo an aggregation operation to yield the ultimate ranking score. The aggregation is commonly carried out through an appropriate aggregation operator. In this paper, we propose an induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator with dual preference setting (2-IOWA) as a new aggregation device. The 2-IOWA aggregation novelty resides in its twined order inducing variables, which are defined by exploiting exclusively the appreciative properties of the CE matrix. The first-order inducing variable is the voting rank order that characterizes the preference voting system embedded within the CE matrix. The corresponding IOWA-level 1 aggregation produces a composite vote for each DMU by employing as arguments the individual votes assigned to it. The second-order inducing variable is represented by these composite votes, which are adopted to induce a common order on the rows of the CE matrix as a part of the IOWA-level 2 aggregation. The 2-IOWA aggregation process is conducted with OWA weights that are generated through different minimax disparity models by using different optimism level values in order to corroborate the influence of subjectivity on the structure of the ranking patterns besides evaluating the robustness of the proposed methodological framework.

AB The paper aims to provide a theoretical basis for the application of revenue-sharing contract under bounded rationality and capital constraints. We consider an uncooperative ordering model in a supplier-Stackelberg game and coordination strategy with revenue-sharing contract for a loss-averse and capital-constrained retailer. We drive the existence and uniqueness conditions of the optimal solutions under bank financing and revenue-sharing contract. We also develop a series of propositions and corollaries to determine the optimal solutions and offer some managerial insights. The key contribution of the paper is to deepen and expand the revenue-sharing contract under the risk-neutral assumption, and to provide a theoretical basis for the application of revenue-sharing contract under bounded rationality and capital constraints. We find that the revenue-sharing ratio of loss-averse and capital-constrained retailer is larger than that of neutral retailer and the expected utility of loss-averse and capital-constrained retailer is larger than that of neutral retailer under coordination strategy with revenue-sharing contract.

AB The bus passenger detection algorithm is a key component of a public transportation bus management system. The detection techniques based on the convolutional neural network have been widely used in bus passenger detection. However, they require high memory and computational requirements, which hinder the deployment of bus passenger detectors in the bus system. In this paper, a lightweight bus passenger detection model based on YOLOv5 is introduced. To make the model more lightweight, the inner and outer cross-stage bottleneck modules, called ICB and OCB, respectively, are proposed. The proposed module reduces the quantity of parameter and floating point operations and increases the detection speed. In addition, the neighbour feature attention pooling is adopted to improve detection accuracy. The performance of the lightweight model on the bus passenger dataset is empirically demonstrated. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is lightweight and efficient. Compared lightweight YOLOv5n with the original algorithm, the model weight is reduced by 31% to 2.6M, and the detection speed is increased by 6% to 40FPS without an accuracy drop.
   We propose a lightweight bus passenger detector based on the network YOLOv5 to improve the bus passenger detection speed. The inner cross bottleneck ICB and outer cross bottleneck OCB are introduced into the YOLOv5 network to achieve model compression, maintain detection accuracy and improve speed. The NFP pooling module is incorporated into the network to aggregate discriminative features and improve the detection accuracy of the model.image

DE Cyber-physical systems; modeling and verification; AADL; process algebra
AB Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are the next generation of intelligent systems that integrate information control devices with physical resources. With increasingly close connections between CPS components and frequent interactions, potential defects grow exponentially, rendering the operating environment of CPS unreliable. Therefore, research on methods and theories to ensure the correctness, safety and reliability of CPS is not only an important research topic but also an inevitable challenge. In this paper, we propose a CPS modeling and verification method based on Architecture Analysis & Design Language (AADL) and process algebra to address this challenge. Due to the continuous, time-constrained, stochastic, uncertain and concurrent characteristics of CPS, this paper considers both flexibility and rigor in the modeling process. We first extend the ability of AADL to describe the multiple characteristics of CPS and propose Hybrid Probability-AADL (HP-AADL). Second, this paper introduces conditional execution, conditional interruption and probability operators into Temporal Calculus of Communication Systems (TCCS) and designs a new formal modeling language Hybrid Probability-Temporal Calculus of Communication Systems (HP-TCCS). However, HP-AADL is a semi-formal modeling language that cannot be directly used for formal verification, it cannot strictly guarantee the quality of the established CPS models, including its functional correctness and safety. Therefore, this paper proposes transformation rules from HP-AADL to HP-TCCS, which enables model checking of CPS models described in HP-AADL within HP-TCCS. Additionally, this paper designs a new formal specification language HPAT-Spatial Temporal Logic (HPAT-STL) based on Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) and Spatial Logic, which characterizes the temporal, probabilistic and spatial properties of CPS model. To achieve formal verification of HP-TCCS model and HPAT-STL formulas, this paper proposes a model checking algorithm HPAT-Model Checking Algorithm (HPAT-MCA). Finally, we discuss a typical CPS example to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in ensuring correct, safe and reliable CPS.

AB Currently, there are demands for machine tools with higher dynamic performance as a result of their high machining accuracy and efficiency in designing complex parts in the manufacturing industry. The motion delays in each of the motion axes cause dynamic tracking errors or tool tracking errors which greatly affect the surface quality of machined parts; hence, tuning the dynamic parameters like the position gains of the motion axis causing the defect is as good as eliminating the error source rather than tuning the parameters of all the motion axes. This work proposes a decoupling method to identify the particular motion axis that greatly affects or causes the tool tracking error by using the ISO BK3 kinematic test, and this involves orientation contour error estimation and motion axis error computation based on inverse kinematics of the machine tool transformation. An experiment was carried out on an industrial machine tool with a tilting rotary table to verify the simulation results; the feed servo system model of the motion axes was constructed using MATLAB Simulink tools. The results obtained show that the tool tracking errors are greatly influenced by some dynamic parameters like the feedrate and the position gains emanating from a particular motion axis with dynamic deficiency, and the proposed decoupling method robustly identifies the individual motion axes greatly affecting the dynamic tracking error which makes it very relevant to tune only the dynamic parameters of those particular motion axes instead tuning all.

AB In this paper, we propose the problem of multi-constrained-s-t simple paths enumeration on temporal graph, which aims to list all temporal paths with the minimum timestamp in the given time interval. To solve this problem, a two-stage algorithm based on temporal subgraph is proposed. In the first stage, two algorithms for creating temporal subgraph are proposed to reduce the search scope. The first creates subgraph based on temporal graph, which uses the results of the vertex pruning algorithm to prune the temporal graph. The second creates temporal subgraph based on edge stream, which reorders the edge stream, traverses the edge stream bidirectionally, and uses the flags to prune edges. In the second stage, the depth-first search algorithm is used to find the paths on the temporal subgraph, and the pruning strategies are used to reduce the search scope. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 8 real datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

ID LOCAL SEARCH; MOEA/D; SELECTION
AB Due to the rapid development of the financial market, the portfolio selection problem has become of the most complex problem in finance. This paper proposes a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on multi-population, called MP-MOEA, to handle the multi-objective constrained portfolio optimization problem (MOCPOP) in order to achieve an optimal trade-off between return and risk. MP-MOEA uses a multi-population strategy to improve the solution's quality and considerably accelerate the convergence. Furthermore, two types of archives (local and global) are employed, where the archives local are used to store the non-dominated solutions corresponding to each subpopulation, and the external archive global is used to store the Pareto solutions. The external archive global is controlled using crowding distance to limit the archive size and avoid increasing the complexity of the MP-MOEA algorithm. Several experiments are conducted on two datasets of instances to compare our algorithm with three elevant state-of-art algorithms including AR-MOEA, MOEA/D-AGR, MOEA/D-GR, MOEA/D, MODEwAwL, and MOPSO. The first dataset consists of 5 instances from OR-Library, while other dataset consists 15 instances from NGINX. Statistical analysis of the comparative results obtained using ANOVA and Wilcoxon test demonstrate the merits and the outperformance of our MP-MOEA algorithm.

   Hyper-parameters and probability distribution
AB Several web services comprise a Recommender System (RS) that assists the user to discover new products and services such as movies, books, articles, jobs, etc. It plays a significant role in filtering data and providing adequate information to users The main goal of RS is to generate the prediction probability in user preferences and user interest in the items depending on users' past choices. However, due to scalability, diversity, accuracy and data sacristy issues, neighborhood selection is more problematic with rapidly maximizing user's quantity and movies. To resolve this problem, the Improved Restricted Boltzmann Machine (IRBM-BO) method is proposed to optimize the hyperparameters of the recommender system. The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a non-deterministic method that is used to learn the probability distribution. The fine-tuning of a predictive model uses hyperparameter settings for enhancing the prediction quality. The RBM integrated with the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm forms an IRBM-BO. The IRBM-BO method is used to address the fine-tuning parameter problems of RBM using the BO algorithm. This BO algorithm optimized three hyperparameters such as learning rate, momentum, and weight-cost with fixed weights for every validation of the proposed method. The proposed IRBM-BO is verified using datasets namely MovieLens 100 K, MovieLens 1 M, and Netflix which are assessed by various evaluation measures namely Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The experiments showed that BO approach enhance the effectiveness of IRBM-BO significantly and also enhance the prediction accuracy of a recommender system efficiently.

AB In this paper, the passivity-based state estimation problem is investigated for Markov jump singularly perturbed neural networks, in which the partially known transition rate matrix and the nonlinear characteristics of sensors are considered simultaneously. By using a new inequality, a novel perturbed parameter dependent Lyapunov function is constructed for Markov jump singularly perturbed neural networks. Based on those, some sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the stochastically mean-square stable for the considered system with the property of passivity. Besides, a less conservativeness state estimator design method is established for Markov jump singularly perturbed neural networks subject to sensor nonlinearity and partially known transition rates. At last, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity of the obtained results.

In particular, AI-based text and image generators are now widely used. This raises a variety of ethical issues. The present paper first gives an introduction to generative AI and then to applied ethics in this context. Three specific image generators are presented: DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. The author goes into technical details and basic principles, and compares their similarities and differences. This is followed by an ethical discussion. The paper addresses not only risks, but opportunities for generative AI. A summary with an outlook rounds off the article.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The density peak clustering (DPC) is one of the most popular algorithms for segmenting images due to its simplicity and efficiency. Since DPC and its variants are not specifically designed for image segmentation, their segmentation results do not necessarily meet both subjective and objective metrics. We propose an expanded relative density-based clustering algorithm as a solution to the above problems, which can automatically determine the cluster number and make the image segmentation results more consistent with subjective criteria. First, the image is pre-segmented into superpixels using the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, and the superpixels are represented by feature vectors containing color and texture information. Secondly, the expanded relative density of the data point is obtained by comparing the tightness of a mini-cluster with its neighboring mini-clusters. The Sigmoid function is then applied to the data point with small density but large relative distance to further adjust its relative distance so that the distribution of cluster centers matches the characteristics of the image. Next, the optimal cluster number is determined by the rate of change of the sum of squared errors. Finally, the cluster center pairs with smaller distances are merged using the cluster center merging algorithm. The experiments conducted on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms.

ID LEADER-FOLLOWER FORMATION
AB The paper presents a neural control system for a swarm of underwater vehicles. A swarm consists of a leader vehicle and follower vehicles. The leader leads the swarm along a predetermined trajectory, detects obstacles and determines obstacle avoidance manoeuvrers for the whole swarm, while the followers follow the leader in a specific formation and avoid the leader and each other. In order to keep the formation without colliding with other members of the swarm, the followers are equipped with a neural control system designed with a neuro-evolutionary algorithm called Hill Climb Assembler Encoding. The system is fed with three sources of information. The first is the leader which, using an acoustic communication system, sends information about its manoeuvrers as well as about the desired type of formation. The second source is sonar, i.e. underwater acoustic radar, whose disadvantage is the difficulty in interpreting the results of operation, i.e. it is difficult to determine whether the observed object is another vehicle or an obstacle. The third source is a camera observation unit consisting of three cameras located around the vehicle. Unfortunately, the disadvantage of this unit is a very short range in opaque water. The proposed control system was tested in simulation conditions and proved to be highly effective. The results of the simulation as well as the design of the system are presented in the paper.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Lightweight recurrent cross-modal encoder for video question answering
SO KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Video question answering; Cross-modality; Lightweight; Learnable token
AB A video question answering task essentially boils down to how to fuse the information between text and video effectively to predict an answer. Most works employ a transformer encoder as a crossmodal encoder to fuse both modalities by leveraging the full self-attention mechanism. Due to the high computational cost of the self-attention and the high dimensional data of video, they either have to settle for: (1) only training the cross-modal encoder on offline-extracted video and text features or (2) training the cross-modal encoder with the video and text feature extractor, but only using sparselysampled video frames. Training only from offline-extracted features suffers from the disconnection between the extracted features and the data of the downstream task because the video and text feature extractors are trained independently on different domains, e.g., action recognition for the video feature extractor and semantic classification for the text feature extractor. Training using sparsely-sampled video frames might suffer from information loss if the video contains very rich information or has many frames. To alleviate those issues, we propose Lightweight Recurrent Cross-modal Encoder (LRCE) that replaces the self-attention operation with a single learnable special token to summarize the text and video features. As a result, our model incurs a significantly lower computational cost. Additionally, we perform a novel multi-segment sampling which sparsely samples the video frames from different segments of the video to provide more fine-grained information. Through extensive experiments on three VideoQA datasets, we demonstrate the LRCE achieves significant performance gains compared to previous works. The code of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/Sejong-VLI/VQALRCE-KBS-2023.

AB Phenotypes (i.e., symptoms and clinical signs) are essential for clinical diagnosis and research related to symptom science and precision health. As clinical observational manifestations of a disease, symptoms are clinically significant because they act as direct causes for patients to seek medical care and the primary indicators for clinicians to provide diagnosis/treatments. However, a comprehensive phenotypic knowledge base and high-quality symptom-gene associations are lacking. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the relationships between symptoms and other entities is urgently needed to support scientific research and clinical health care. In this paper, we constructed a systematic, largescale, and high-quality symptom -gene associations network system named SympGAN (accessible at http://www.sympgan.org/). We provide access to the database with millions of associations between symptoms, genes, diseases, and drugs, as well as the system for users to search, analyze, knowledge inference, and present data visualization. We utilize state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms as the backbone to form the final dataset. In addition, we utilize the RoBERTaPubMed neural network for name entity recognition to assist in data screening. The knowledge graph is adopted to organize the relationships between different entities. We adopt ConvE, TuckER, and HypER methods for knowledge completion experiments to validate the quality of final knowledge graph triples. Based on the results, we provide online automatic knowledge inference interfaces. The system, SympGAN, has promising value for disease diagnosis, decision support in health care, precision health, and scientific research, as researchers and practitioners can easily access information about symptoms, diseases, targets, gene ontology, and drugs.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Discrepancy representation metric completely determines the transfer diagnosis performance of deep domain adaptation methods. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) based on the mean statistic, as the commonly used metric, has poor discrepancy representation in some cases. MMD is generally known from the aspect of kernel function, but the inherent relationship between the two is unknown. To deal with these issues, the authors theoretically explore their relationship first. With the revealed relationship, a novel discrepancy representation metric named maximum mean square discrepancy (MMSD), which can comprehensively reflect the mean and variance information of data samples in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, is constructed for enhancing domain confusion. Additionally, for the real application under limited samples and ensuring the effectiveness of MMSD, biased and unbiased empirical MMSD statistics are developed, and the error bounds between the two empirical statistics and the real distribution discrepancy are derived. The proposed MMSD is successfully applied to the end-to-end fault diagnosis of planetary gearbox of wind turbine without labeled target-domain samples. The experimental results on twelve cross-load transfer tasks validate that MMSD has a better ability of discrepancy representation and a higher diagnosis accuracy compared with other well-known discrepancy representation metrics.

AB Nowadays, there is a growing interest among researchers in health monitoring using body sensor data due to its usage in diverse applications. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) utilizes smart wearable devices, particularly in healthcare, to help the elderly population improve their lifestyle by preventing forthcoming exceptional events such as health risks and falls. Although various types of sensors are available to recognize human behaviors, wearable sensors provide consistent information about the lifestyle and functionality of subjects. However, accurate recognition requires intelligent algorithms to extract temporal features of time series data from raw sensor readings. In order to recognize human activities more accurately from time series data, this paper proposes a crossover Aquila-optimized Tri-kernel Extreme Learning Machine (CSA-TkELM) classifier. The sensor data utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA-TkELM classifier is obtained from the USC Human Activity Dataset (USC-HAD), the Public domain dataset for Real-life human activity recognition using smartphone Sensors (PDS-SS), and the OPPORTUNITY dataset. The direct application of raw time series data to the classifier affects its recognition performance. Therefore, preprocessing steps such as noise removal, handling missing values, standardization, and segmentation are executed. The proposed CSA-TkELM classifier extracts significant temporal features from the time series information and recognizes activities. Several performance metrics, such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1 score, are measured to investigate the results of the proposed CSA-TkELM classifier. The proposed CSA-TkELM classifier achieves a recall of 98.1%, precision of 97.6%, accuracy of 97.9%, and F1 score of 97.3%, which are higher than those of other compared existing techniques.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The evaluation of systems that claim to recognize emotions expressed by human beings is a contested and complex task: The early pioneers in this field gave the impression that these systems will eventually recognize a flash of anger, suppressed glee/happiness, momentary disgust or contempt, lurking fear, or sadness in someone's face or voice (Picard and Klein, 2002; Schuller et al., 2011). Emotion recognition systems are trained on 'labelled' databases - collection of video/audio recording comprising images and voices of humans enacting one emotional state. Machine learning programmes then regress the pixel distributions or wave forms against the labels. The system is then said to have learnt how to recognize and interpret human emotions and rated using information science metrics. These systems are adopted by the world at large for applications ranging from autistic spectrum communications to teaching and learning, and onwards to covert surveillance. The training databases depend upon human emotions recorded in ideal conditions - faces looking at the camera and centrally located, voices articulated through noise-cancelling microphones. Yet there are reports that the posed training data set, that is racially-skewed and gender unbalanced, does not prepare these systems to cope with data-in-the-wild and that expression-unrelated variations (like illumination, head pose, and identity bias (Li and Deng, 2020)) can impact their performance as well. Deployments of these systems tend to adopt one or other and apply it to data collected outside laboratory conditions and use the resulting classifications in subsequent processing. We have devised a testing method that helps to quantify the similarities and differences of facial emotion recognition systems (FER) and speech emotion recognition systems (SER). We report on the development of a data base comprising videos and sound track of 64 politicians and 7 government spokespersons (25 F, 46 M; 34 White Europeans, 19 East Asians, and 18 South Asians), ranging in age from 32-85 years, and each of the 71 has on average three 180 s videos; a total of 16.66 h of data. We have compared the performance of two FERs (Emotient and Affectiva) and two SERs (OpenSmile and Vokaturi) on our data by analysing emotions reported by these systems on a frame-by-frame basis. We have analysed the directly observable head movements, and the indirectly observable muscle movement parts of the face and for the muscle movements in the vocal tract. There was marked disagreement in emotions recognized, and the differences were exacerbated more women than for men, and more for South and East Asians than for White Europeans. Levels of agreement and disagreement on both high-level (i.e. emotion labels) and lower-level features (e.g. Euler angles of head movement) are shown. We show that inter-system disagreement may also be used as an effective response variable in reasoning about data features that influence disagreement. We argue that reliability of subsequent processing in approaches that adopt these systems may be enhanced by restricting action to cases where systems agree within a given tolerance level. This paper may be considered as a foray into the greater debate about the socalled algorithmic (un)fairness and data bias in the development and deployment of machine learning systems of which FERs and SERs are a good exemplar.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB An efficient convolution kernel could transform images into more expressive representations, which usually determines the quality of image classification models. Algorithms in the field of hyper-parameter optimization and neural architecture search could be applied to mining optimal kernels, while hyper-parameter optimization algorithms always require multiple training sessions to evaluate hyper-parameter configurations, resulting in a high time consumption. Recent gradient-based archi-tecture search algorithms could deal with such problems within a single training session. However, there are currently no gradient-based NAS algorithms that could be used to efficiently optimize convolution kernels. This paper proposes a novel gradient-based algorithm, SoftStep, which could precisely and efficiently fine-tune the hyper-parameters of kernels. The proposed SoftStep is applied for the optimization of the convolution kernel's key hyper-parameters and generalized to more hyper-parameters in deep learning. In experiments, architecture search tasks on multiple challenging datasets are compared to various state-of-art hyper-parameter optimization and architecture search algorithms. The reported results show that SoftStep could mine optimal kernels far more efficiently than other SOTA methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   learning; Reinforcement learning; Spurious paths
AB Multi-hop knowledge graph question answering targets at pinpointing the answer entities by inferring across multiple triples in knowledge graphs. To enhance model interpretability, path-based methods are proposed. Specifically, with the advances of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), this paper explores to extend the line of RL-based approaches. However, existing solutions suffer from the issue of spurious paths. A major reason lies in that the agent takes an opportunistic way to explicitly pursue the predictive accuracy of answer entities instead of considering correct reasoning paths. To overcome this challenge, our idea is inspired by adversarial learning and we expect that a discriminator could effectively distinguish whether the reasoning chain is correct or not. To this end, we propose an interpretable reasoning method based on adversarial reinforcement learning for multi -hop KGQA, namely Adversarial Reinforcement Reasoning Network (AR2N). AR2N consists of two crucial components: an answer generator (i.e., policy network of RL) and a path discriminator. By alternately updating two components in an adversarial manner, the generator is able to infer answer entities by following the correct reasoning chain, the discriminator is capable of evaluating the plausibility of reasoning paths. Extensive experiments conducted over three benchmark datasets well demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.1 & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BAYESIAN NETWORKS; ALGORITHM
AB Causal discovery plays a vital role in the human understanding of the world. Searching a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observed data is one of the most widely used methods. However, in most existing approaches, the global search has poor scalability, and the local search is often insufficient to discover a reliable causal graph. In this paper, we propose a generic metaheuristic method to discover the causal relationship in the DAG itself instead in of any equivalent but indirect substitutes. We first propose several novel heuristic factors to expand the search space and maintain acyclicity. Second, using these factors, we propose a metaheuristic algorithm to further search for the optimal solution closer to real causality in the DAG space. Theoretical studies show the correctness of our proposed method. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify its generalization ability, scalability, and effectiveness on real-world and simulated structures for both discrete and continuous models by comparing it with other state-of-the-art causal solvers. We also compare the performance of our method with that of a state-of-the-art approach on well-known medical data.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Instance segmentation; Fine-grained feature perception; Cross-path

AB Most existing instance segmentation methods are based on object detection models, and their segmentation performance is limited by the accuracy of the detection boxes. To overcome the limitation of detection boxes, we propose an instance segmentation algorithm based on fine-grained feature perception and cross-path aggregation. Our approach aims to find strongly distinguished feature regions without relying on detection boxes and to perform precise local segmentation. Therefore, a fine-grained feature perception module is designed in the decoding stage by compressing the number of channels to aggregate scattered feature responses and then using an activation function to obtain a weight matrix. Finally, the weight matrix is used to find feature maps that focus on different mask regions to perform precise local segmentation. In addition, we also design a new cross-path aggregation structure in the encoding stage to reduce the loss of foreground instance information during network propagation.

AB Newsrooms and journalists today rely on many different artificial-intelligence, big-data and knowledge based systems to support efficient and high-quality journalism. However, making the different systems work together remains a challenge, calling for new unified journalistic knowledge platforms. A software reference architecture for journalistic knowledge platforms could help news organisations by capturing tried-and-tested best practices and providing a generic blueprint for how their IT infrastructure should evolve. To the best of our knowledge, no suitable architecture has been proposed in the literature. Therefore, this article proposes a software reference architecture for integrating artificial intelligence and knowledge bases to support journalists and newsrooms. The design of the proposed architecture is grounded on the research literature and on our experiences with developing a series of prototypes in collaboration with industry. Our aim is to make it easier for news organisations to evolve their existing independent systems for news production towards integrated knowledge platforms and to direct further research. Because journalists and newsrooms are early adopters of integrated knowledge platforms, our proposal can hopefully also inform architectures in other domains with similar needs. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

DE Deep neural network; Sparse reparameterization; Regularization technique
AB Sparse reparameterization in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) aims to achieve a better tradeoff between the network parameter count and performance. Recently, the lottery ticket hypothesis suppose that excellent sub-networks ("winning tickets") exist in dense randomly-initialized networks. These sparse sub-networks trained from scratch are able to reach the performance of their dense counterparts. Compared with Iterative Magnitude Pruning that relies on pruning strategies, the Continuous Sparsification algorithm learns the "winning tickets" with gradient-based methods, achieving better performance. In this paper, we propose Layer-wise Continuous Sparsification (LCS) scheme for finding sparse sub-networks, in which the parameterized relaxation of step functions used to remove network parameters in each layer is integrated into the DNN loss as an optimization objective. LCS utilizes a family of sigmoid functions to asynchronously filter important per-layer weights throughout training, yielding sparser and better sub-networks. Experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-theart methods for sparse reparameterization. Additionally, the proposed method can be utilized as a regularization technique to further improve the accuracy of dense networks1.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CANCER RISK-ASSESSMENT; BREAST-CANCER; SMOTE
AB Class imbalance hinders the performance of some standard classifiers. However, class imbalance may not be solely responsible for the decrease in performance. Research efforts show that imbalanced datasets suffer from overlapping problems and borderline samples, which often deteriorate the classification performance. Conventional imbalanced learning methods mainly focus on balancing the distribution between classes but ignore difficulties caused by the above problems, thus underperforming drastically. This paper proposes a hybrid network called SemiPro-Empha to alleviate the aforementioned problems by learning a feature space with good inter-class separability and intra-class compactness. SemiPro-Empha comprises two modules: a feature learning loss called Semi-Prototype contrastive loss (Semi-Proto), guiding the feature extractor to learn a feature space where the projections of original overlapping classes can be separated, thereby improving classification performance. Additionally, this paper also presents a robust valuable borderline sample mining strategy called Emphasizing (Empha). Emphasizing identifies "valuable"borderline samples and eliminates noisy samples to create an auxiliary training dataset during each training epoch, providing up-to-date global classification boundary information for the training model while ensuring its robustness. Extensive experiments conducted on the breast cancer dataset and seven imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SemiPro-Empha. & COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Heterogeneous graph neural network; Iterative similarity distillation;
   Self-distillation; Metapath correlation
AB This paper focuses on the self-supervised learning issue on heterogeneous graph. Currently, contrastive learning has become the dominant approach on various heterogeneous graph tasks. Its performance is highly dependent on the elaborate selection strategy of negative samples. However, it is difficult to design such an ideal strategy giving sufficient consideration to the characteristics of graph, such as structural similarity and feature similarity. To circumvent this problem, we propose a novel negative sample-free self-supervised framework named HGISD (Heterogeneous Graph learning based on Iterative Similarity Distillation), where the student improves itself by imitating the teacher's behavior and the teacher updates itself as a slow-moving average of the student. Moreover, metapath-based HGNN is employed as the built-in information encoder. We argue that previous metapath-based HGNNs neglect the correlation among metapaths and the locality within metapaths. To tackle these issues, we respectively propose IMCD (Inter-Metapath Correlation Distillation) and IMSD (Intra-Metapath Similarity Distillation) within the self-distillation framework. Both IMCD and IMSD treat the embeddings in the shallow layers as the knowledge source, which well preserves the inter-metapath correlation and the intra-metapath locality. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several real -world heterogeneous graph datasets. The results show that the proposed HGISD achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Motivated with recent advances in inferring users' mental state in social media posts, we identify and formulate the problem of finding causal indicators behind mental illness in self-reported text. In the past, we witness the presence of rule-based studies for causal explanation analysis on curated Facebook data. The investigation on transformer-based model for multi-class causal categorization in Reddit posts point to a problem of using long-text which contains as many as 4000 words. Developing end-to-end transformer-based models subject to the limitation of maximum-length in a given instance. To handle this problem, we use Longformer and deploy its encoding on transformer-based classifier. The experimental results show that Longformer achieves new state-of-the-art results on M-CAMS, a publicly available dataset with 62% F1-score. Cause-specific analysis and ablation study prove the effectiveness of Longformer. We believe our work facilitates causal analysis of depression and suicide risk on social media data, and shows potential for application on other mental health conditions. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE Decentralized federated learning; Hierarchical framework; Privacy

AB Federated Learning (FL) breaks the "data island"and lets clients cooperate in training a shared model with private data locally. And hierarchical framework is used in FL to alleviate the problem of excessive communication overhead. FL provides a certain degree of privacy, but privacy inference and Byzantine attacks still affect the existing FL methods. Moreover, the parameter server brings new security troubles, and the group size limits the model's robustness. Thus, this paper presents a new decentralized FL framework called Trustiness-based Hierarchical Decentralized Federated Learning (TH-DFL) via a Security Robust Aggregation (SRA) rule, which introduces a trust mechanism. This study provides privacy protection and robustness even if there are malicious nodes. Besides, it somewhat reduces communication overhead. A series of comparative studies are also implemented to evaluate the performance of the model. In this process, the Gaussian, the bit-flipping, and other attacks are launched in the simulated federated learning. The results show that on the basis of ensuring privacy and robustness, TH-DFL seeks a better balance between privacy and robustness when the size of the group changes. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a hardware-based QUATRE algorithm is designed and implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). To facilitate the implementation of the QUATRE algorithm on hardware, this paper simplifies the co-evolutionary matrix generation process. Compared with the original QUATRE algorithm, the simplified QUATRE algorithm may reduce latency and resource occupation. The Vivado High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design tool is used to complete the IP core design of the QUATRE algorithm. Through the benchmark function test under different population sizes, compared with the QUATRE algorithm implemented by software, both the running speed and optimization performance of the QUATRE algorithm implemented by hardware are significantly better than the former. Compared with the GA, DE, and PSO algorithms implemented by hardware, the QUATRE algorithm also shows strong competitiveness.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION
AB Real-life objects typically contain complex structures, and the graph is a prevalent presentation for describing such objects. Multi-graph multi-label (MGML) learning is a supervised learning framework for learning complicated objects associated with multiple labels, where each object is described as a bag-of-graphs representation. However, existing methods are dependent on transforming graphs into instances, which prevents the structure information from being fully utilized; in addition, the adaptability of MGML is insufficient for the assumptions that the label set is in a closed environment and complete. In real applications, some novel labels may exist outside the fixed set, and some values of labels are missing. Existing MGML approaches are unable to deal with these novel and missing labels. In this paper, we propose a new multi-graph multi-label learning with novel and missing labels (MGMLNM) algorithm, which is the first attempt to learn novel and missing labels in the MGML problem. To preserve the structure information, we exploit the specific graph kernels to generate an efficient graph representation. To learn multi-graph data with novel and missing labels, we propose a unified objective function, which has a two-perspective regularization term, a projection-similarity regularization term, and a bag-dependent regularization term, enabling novel and missing labels to be modeled simultaneously and exploring the complex relationship between bag and graph labels. Two first-order proximity optimization methods are then developed to solve the unified problem efficiently. A theoretical analysis of the generalization bound is provided for the unified objective. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How to extract discriminative latent feature representations from electroencephalography (EEG) signals and build a generalized model is a topic in EEG-based emotion recognition research. This study proposed a novel emotion recognition model based on deep latent feature fusion of EEG signals and multi-task learning, referred to as MTLFuseNet. MTLFuseNet learned spatio-temporal latent features of EEG in an unsupervised manner by a variational autoencoder (VAE) and learned the spatio-spectral features of EEG in a supervised manner by a graph convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) network. Afterward, the two latent features were fused to form more complementary and discriminative spatio-temporal-spectral fusion features for EEG signal representation. In addition, MTLFuseNet was constructed based on multi-task learning. The focal loss was introduced to solve the problem of unbalanced sample classes in an emotional dataset, and the triplet-center loss was introduced to make the fused latent feature vectors more discriminative. Finally, a subject-independent leave-one-subject-out cross-validation strategy was used to validate extensively on two public datasets, DEAP and DREAMER. On the DEAP dataset, the average accuracies of valence and arousal are 71.33% and 73.28%, respectively. On the DREAMER dataset, the average accuracies of valence and arousal are 80.43% and 83.33%, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed MTLFuseNet model achieves excellent recognition performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI An efficient semi-supervised balanced cut with hard pairwise constraints

DE Graph-based clustering; Semi-supervised clustering; Pairwise constraints
AB With a small scale of prior information, including pairwise constraints and partial labels, semi supervised clustering algorithms can improve clustering performance by imposing certain restrictions on the clustering results, and have accordingly attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Moreover, a large number of graph-based semi-supervised clustering algorithms have been proposed, since graphs are naturally suited to pairwise constraints. However, most graph-based approaches involve a two-step process and are not scalable to large-scale datasets due to their high time complexity. Additionally, they also encounter a serious problem of constraint violation. To deal with this issue, we propose a new non-parametric model to directly obtain the indicator matrix by minimizing the cut of the graph with a regularization term that corresponds to the balance of the clusters. To simultaneously support the two forms of prior information, our approach restricts the indicator matrix during optimization, while also ensuring that the clusters obtained by our approach do not violate any constraints. The computational complexity of the proposed approach is nearly linear to the data size n. Experiments show that the algorithm proposed in this paper achieves significant improvements in both clustering performance and efficiency.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COMPUTATION
AB Graph similarity estimation is a challenging task due to the complex graph structure. Though important and well-studied, three key aspects are yet to be fully handled in a unified framework: (i) how to exploit the node embedding by leveraging both local spatial neighborhood information and the global context, (ii) how to effectively learn richer cross graph interactions from a pairwise node perspective and (iii) how to map the similarity matrix into a similarity score by exploiting the inherent structure in the similarity matrix. To solve these issues, we explore multiple attention mechanisms for graph similarity learning in this work. More specifically, we propose a unified graph similarity learning framework involving (i) a hybrid of graph convolution and graph self-attention for node embedding learning, (ii) a cross graph co-attention (GCA) module for graph interaction modeling, (iii) similarity-wise self-attention (SSA) module for graph similarity matrix alignment and (iv) graph similarity matrix learning for predicting the similarity scores. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks including LINUX, AIDS, and IMDBMulti demonstrate that the proposed NA-GSL performs favorably against state-of-the-art graph similarity estimation methods.

AB A real-world dataset often generates a huge concept lattice that may be difficult to understand and impractical to use. The principle of granular computing is that we can understand and use a complex whole at multiple levels of granularity. In light of this, we propose a unified tri-granularity model of various types of concept lattices, which allows us to examine a huge concept lattice at three levels of granularity (i.e., the elementary granularity, local granularity and global granularity). Attribute reduction plays a fundamental role in three-way concept analysis, it simplifies the expression of three-way concepts and thus contributes to a better perception of the knowledge in three-way concept lattices. The tri-granularity model suggests an opportunity to investigate the tri-granularity attribute reduction of three-way concept lattices. The existing research on attribute reduction works at the global granularity but pays little attention to the local granularity, or, even less, to the elementary granularity. Driven by these issues, we supply definitions and methods of local granularity and elementary granularity attribute reduction of three-way concept lattices. These newly proposed two levels of attribute reduction with the existing global granularity attribute reduction together provide a framework for the tri-granularity attribute reduction of three-way concept lattices. We further analyze the relationships among the three levels of attribute reduction. Moreover, the efficacy of our suggested approach is illustrated by an example via the trisections induced by three-way concepts. Finally, we design two tri-granularity attribute reduction algorithms whose effectiveness is further examined by numerical experiments. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A dynamic adaptive iterative clustered federated learning scheme

LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; Distributed machine learning
AB Clustered federated learning (CFL), as an important research branch of personalized federated learning (FL), can better cope with the highly statistically heterogeneous federated learning environment and provide higher quality services to clients. However, existing CFL schemes have difficulties in adapting to real-time data distribution changes due to disadvantages such as relatively fixed cluster structure. This poses a great challenge to the practical deployment of CFL schemes. To address the common problems of existing CFL schemes, we propose a more flexible dynamic adaptive cluster federated learning scheme (AICFL). AICFL uses the mutual sensitivity between models and data as intuition to perform cluster identity estimation, cluster addition, cluster model updating, and cluster deletion in the early iterations of FL to find the optimal client cluster partitioning. Firstly, this process does not require a priori estimation of the number of clusters and does not require the online participation of all clients. Secondly, during cluster partitioning, AICFL is able to adjust the cluster structure in real time based on the overall data distribution. Moreover, AICFL has the same ability to adapt to changes in the system environment in the middle and late stages of FL. The experimental results show that our scheme gives the most reasonable cluster partitioning results in all cases which indicates that AICFL is able to cope with the above-mentioned distribution changes well, and has better adaptability and better flexibility than other schemes.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Forecasting incoming water demand is a critical step in efficient reservoir management and revenue optimization in large-scale cascade hydropower stations. It depends on multiple factors, such as weather conditions, grid dispatch, and electricity demand, and, in turn, facilitates a range of downstream decision-making, from natural hazards control and water ecology protection to power generation plans. Current efforts mainly rely on methodologies from statistical machine learning or deep neural networks to model the hydrological patterns from historical time series for inflow forecasting. However, existing models are restricted by short-term temporal dependencies and are prone to error accumulation issues due to the underlying autoregressive architecture. Meanwhile, most recent self-attention time-series models fail to achieve real-time inflow forecasting because of tremendous parameters and computational bottlenecks on learning long time series with fine granularity. We propose a novel framework, called DTODE (Dynamic Transformer Ordinary Differential Equations), for capturing nonlinear and non-stationary evolving patterns inherent in hydrological time series. Specifically, we present the dynamic self-attention mechanism combining transformer and ordinary differential equations that simultaneously captures long-range dependencies of observations from a dynamic system perspective. DTODE exploits a continuum of self-attention layers (instead of discrete counterparts) to learn the dynamics of multivariate time series while paying attention to the co-evolving time-related factors. Besides, our model is flexible in inferring the complex states at any time step, allowing us to forecast inflows at multiple time horizons. Comprehensive evaluations on real-world datasets show that DTODE significantly reduces forecasting errors compared to state-of-the-art inflow prediction systems. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

This is because the amount of medical image data is generally small, the lesion area is small, and Unet ignores the importance of different information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Unet-based attention network for accurate segmentation of liver CT images. Specifically, we first creatively design an attention mechanism module (DASGC) that pays attention to both multi-scale spatial information and inter-channel information at the same time, which can give more weight to important feature information and perform the feature information screening task well. Secondly, based on the advantages of DASGC's efficient development of limited information, we masterly design an improved Unet network (DASGC-Unet) to solve the problem that the Unet network cannot effectively use less image information to complete accurate segmentation. Finally, on the LiTS2017 public dataset, our method achieves the best results on mIoU, IoU, and Dice coefficient compared to other advanced attention mechanism networks.

   parameter learning
AB Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm in which decentralized client devices collaboratively train shared model under the coordinating of a central server without sharing local data. Data heterogeneity is one of the major challenges faced by federated learning, which leading to lagged convergence and decreased accuracy of the global model. Moreover, existing personalized federated learning (PFL) methods suffer from limited personalization capabilities and slow model convergence. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Hypernetwork based layer-wise PFL algorithm, pFedLHN. The Hypernetwork located on the server is collaboratively trained by the clients to generate unique personalized models based on their local data distribution. Unlike previous PFL algorithms that focus on optimizing and personalizing the whole shared model, we implement layer-wise modules with parameter sharing mechanisms in the Hypernetwork. This approach allows the Hypernetwork to generate parameters independently for each layer of the client's network, enabling the layer-wise modules to focus on learning the different utilities in the network. Consequently, this enhances the model's personalized ability and training efficiency. We conducted several experiments on various PFL benchmark datasets, demonstrating that pFedLHN outperforms previous methods and has better generalization ability on clients that did not participate in the training phase.

ID MODEL
AB Currently, Android malware detection methods always focus on one kind of app feature, such as structural, semantic, or other statistical features. This paper proposes a novel Android malware detection method that integrates multiple features of Android applications. First, to effectively extract the structural and semantic features, we propose a new type of call graph named the class-set call graph (CSCG) that uses the sets of Java classes as nodes and the call relationships between class sets as edges, and we design a dynamic adaptive CSCG construction method that can automatically determine the node size for applications with different scales. The topic model is used to mine the source code semantics from the class sets as the node features. Then, we use a graph attention network (GAT) with max pooling to extract the CSCG feature that encompass both the semantic and structural features of the Android application. Furthermore, we construct a deep multimodal feature fusion network to fuse the CSCG features with permission features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a detection accuracy of 97.28%-99.54% on the three constructed datasets, which is better than the existing methods.

AB Perception algorithms that provide estimates of their uncertainty are crucial to the development of autonomous robots that can operate in challenging and uncontrolled environments. Such perception algorithms provide the means for having risk-aware robots that reason about the probability of successfully completing a task when planning. There exist perception algorithms that come with models of their uncertainty; however, these models are often developed with assumptions, such as perfect data associations, that do not hold in the real world. Hence the resultant estimated uncertainty is a weak lower bound. To tackle this problem we present introspective perception - a novel approach for predicting accurate estimates of the uncertainty of perception algorithms deployed on mobile robots. By exploiting sensing redundancy and consistency constraints naturally present in the data collected by a mobile robot, introspective perception learns an empirical model of the error distribution of perception algorithms in the deployment environment and in an autonomously supervised manner. In this paper, we present the general theory of introspective perception and demonstrate successful implementations for two different perception tasks. We provide empirical results on challenging real-robot data for introspective stereo depth estimation and introspective visual simultaneous localization and mapping and show that they learn to predict their uncertainty with high accuracy and leverage this information to significantly reduce state estimation errors for an autonomous mobile robot.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Matching the similarity between a template and search region is crucial in Siamese trackers. However, due to the limited information provided by a fixed template, existing trackers are not robust enough in complex scenarios, such as severe deformation, background clutters, out-of-view, illumination variation, low resolution, scale variation, fast motion, and full occlusion. Therefore, it is essential to use an informative template. Additionally, since the Transformer has superior model capability compared to traditional cross-correlation in tracking, some Siamese trackers have integrated Transformers and achieved exceptional performance. In this paper, we present a novel tracking architecture with Multiple Templates Transformer (MTT) to address the above issues. By utilizing multiple templates, the proposed method can grasp more contextual information and historical changes about the target, which can be leveraged to enhance the response in the search region using an encoder-decoder framework. We also explore different mechanisms to fuse templates effectively to achieve higher accuracy. We evaluate MTT in several famous benchmarks such as GOT-10k, TrackingNet, UAV123, OTB2015, VOT2018, and LaSOT. Extensive experimental results indicate that our tracker is capable of achieving better robustness in the face of different challenges while maintaining a considerable real-time speed.

AB SiC (silicon carbide), as the most important third-generation semiconductor material, has huge market prospects in numerous fields, such as 5G base stations and new energy vehicle charging piles. The identification of SiC crystal defects is essential for improving crystal quality. Currently, this study relies mainly on artificial methods to identify defects, which have significant limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Thus, to quickly detect and classify different SiC crystal defects in complex scenarios, a convolutional neural network-based SiC crystal defect detection (SCDD-Net) model is presented for the first time in this study. SCDD-Net uses an improved online convolutional re-parameterization method that can effectively extract the features of SiC crystal defects and decrease the large training overhead. We devised a new spatial pyramid pooling module that, when combined with the global context block, enables the fast fusion of high-level crystal defects and underlying features. We also designed an anchor-based decoupling detection head network to identify smaller crystal defects. By collecting and processing more than 5300 high-quality microscopic images, we built a fine-grained labeled SiC crystal defect image dataset, SiC-Crystal-5K, for the first time. The experimental results show that the SCDD-Net has excellent detection accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models. The mean average precision for high-resolution SiC crystal defect identification reached 99.53%, corresponding to a single-image detection speed of 102 fps. In addition to crystal-defect detection, the SCDD-Net model can be used as a general-purpose detector in a wide range of scenarios.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Natural neighbor (NaN) is an adaptive neighbor concept for automatically determining k value for k-nearest neighbors, which has been proved effective in clustering analysis, classification, and outlier detection. However, the existing algorithms for searching NaN employ the global search strategy, which increases unnecessary consumption of time on non-critical points. To solve this problem, we propose a novel accelerated algorithm by utilizing a local search strategy, called ASNN. ASNN is based on the fact that if remote points have reverse nearest neighbors, others are likely to have reverse nearest neighbors. Firstly, it extracts the remote points by defining remote radius. Secondly, only the neighbors of remote points are searched, so that ASNN can quickly obtain the natural neighbor eigenvalue (NaNE). Compared to existing algorithms for searching NaNs, ASNN drastically reduces the number of query points and time consumption. The efficiency and effectiveness of ASNN are proved on synthetic and real datasets.

AB Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in terms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. Comprehensive sets of data and annotations are difficult to acquire. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training, with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter adjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly detection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets (tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain CT), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. Overall, we find that a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives state-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research.Code for our DAE model and coarse noise is provided at: https://github.com/AntanasKascenas/DenoisingAE.

ID DIFFEOMORPHIC IMAGE REGISTRATION
AB We present KeyMorph, a deep learning-based image registration framework that relies on automatically detecting corresponding keypoints. State-of-the-art deep learning methods for registration often are not robust to large misalignments, are not interpretable, and do not incorporate the symmetries of the problem. In addition, most models produce only a single prediction at test-time. Our core insight which addresses these shortcomings is that corresponding keypoints between images can be used to obtain the optimal transformation via a differentiable closed-form expression. We use this observation to drive the end-to-end learning of keypoints tailored for the registration task, and without knowledge of ground-truth keypoints. This framework not only leads to substantially more robust registration but also yields better interpretability, since the keypoints reveal which parts of the image are driving the final alignment. Moreover, KeyMorph can be designed to be equivariant under image translations and/or symmetric with respect to the input image ordering. Finally, we show how multiple deformation fields can be computed efficiently and in closed-form at test time corresponding to different transformation variants. We demonstrate the proposed framework in solving 3D affine and spline-based registration of multi-modal brain MRI scans. In particular, we show registration accuracy that surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large displacements.

ID STOCHASTIC CONFIGURATION NETWORKS
AB By generating prediction intervals (PIs) to quantify the uncertainty of each prediction in deep learning regression, the risk of wrong predictions can be effectively controlled. High-quality PIs need to be as narrow as possible, whilst covering a preset proportion of real labels. At present, many approaches to improve the quality of PIs can effectively reduce the width of PIs, but they do not ensure that enough real labels are captured. Inductive Conformal Predictor (ICP) is an algorithm that can generate effective PIs which is theoretically guaranteed to cover a preset proportion of data. However, typically ICP is not directly optimized to yield minimal PI width. In this study, we propose Directly Optimized Inductive Conformal Regression (DOICR) for neural networks that takes only the average width of PIs as the loss function and increases the quality of PIs through an optimized scheme, under the validity condition that sufficient real labels are captured in the PIs. Benchmark experiments show that DOICR outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for regression problems using underlying Deep Neural Network structures for both tabular and image data.

DE Neural network; Long-tailed recognition; Imbalanced learning;
   Contrastive learning
AB Real-world data often exhibits a long-tailed distribution, in which head classes occupy most of the data, while tail classes only have very few samples. Models trained on long-tailed datasets have poor adaptability to tail classes and the decision boundaries are ambiguous. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model, named Dual-Branch Long-Tailed Recognition (DB-LTR), which includes an imbalanced learning branch and a Contrastive Learning Branch (CoLB). The imbalanced learning branch, which consists of a shared backbone and a linear classifier, leverages common imbalanced learning approaches to tackle the data imbalance issue. In CoLB, we learn a prototype for each tail class, and calculate an inter-branch contrastive loss, an intra-branch contrastive loss and a metric loss. CoLB can improve the capability of the model in adapting to tail classes and assist the imbalanced learning branch to learn a well-represented feature space and discriminative decision boundary. Extensive experiments on three long-tailed benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT and Places-LT, show that our DB-LTR is competitive and superior to the comparative methods.

AB Monocular depth estimation has received more and more attention due to its wide range of application scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel simple framework, called CATNet, which treats monocular depth estimation as an ordinal regression problem. At present, in order to obtain higher performance, the research on monocular depth estimation is achieved by increasing the amount of calculation and parameters of the model. Based on this, we propose a novel simple encoder-decoder architecture that aims to reduce the SOTA model parameters and complexity while keeping the depth estimation accuracy as high as possible rather than aiming for extremely lightweight. Meanwhile, in order to further refine the multi-scale information extracted by the encoder, we propose a Multi-dimensional Convolutional Attention (MCA) module. To enhance the extraction of global information for accurate pixel classification, we propose a Dual Attention Transformer (DAT) module to extract global features of images. Furthermore, experimental results on the KITTI and NYU datasets demonstrate that the advantage of our proposed framework is that it achieves almost equivalent depth estimation performance to the current SOTA with fewer parameters and lower complexity. To the best of our knowledge, CATNet is the first work that achieves nearly the same depth estimation accuracy as Transformer-based large model encoders with so few parameters.

AB Rural microcredit plays an important role in promoting rural economic development and increasing farmers' income. However, traditional credit risk assessment models may have insufficient adaptability in rural areas. This study is based on the improved Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm using self organizing method, aiming to design an optimized evaluation model for rural microcredit risk. The improved LSTM algorithm can better capture the long-term dependence between the borrower's historical behavior and risk factors with its advantages in sequential data modeling. The experimental results show that the rural microcredit risk assessment model based on the self organizing LSTM algorithm has higher accuracy and stability compared to traditional models, and can effectively control credit default risk, providing more comprehensive risk management support for financial institutions. In addition, the model also has real-time monitoring and warning functions, which helps financial institutions adjust their decisions in a timely manner and reduce credit losses. The practical application of this study is expected to promote the stable development of rural economy and the advancement of financial technology. However, future work needs to further validate the practical application effectiveness and interpretability of the model, taking into account the special circumstances of different rural areas, in order to achieve sustainable application of the model in the rural microcredit market.

AB Rician noise removal is an important problem in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Among the existing approaches, the variational method is an essential mathematical technique for Rician noise reduction. The previous variational methods mainly employ the total variation (TV) regularizer, which is a first-order term. Although the TV regularizer is able to remove noise while preserving object edges, it suffers the staircase effect. Besides, the adaptability has received little research attention. To this end, we propose a spatially variant high-order variational model (SVHOVM) for Rician noise reduction. We introduce a spatially variant TV regularizer, which can adjust the smoothing strength for each pixel depending on its characteristics. Furthermore, SVHOVM utilizes the bounded Hessian (BH) regularizer to diminish the staircase effect generated by the TV term. We develop a split Bregman algorithm to solve the proposed minimization problem. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of SVHOVM over some existing variational models for Rician noise removal.

AB The mental health problem of college students has gradually become the focus of people's attention. The music appreciation course in university is a very effective approach of psychological counseling, and it is urgent to explore the role of music appreciation in psychological adjustment. Therefore, we propose an emotion classification model based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to study the effect of inter active music appreciation teaching on the mental health of college students. We first extract musical features as input. Then, the extracted music appreciation features generate subtitles of music information. Finally, we weight the above features, input them into the network, modify the network through particle swarm optimization, and output the emotional class of music. The experimental results show that the music emotion classification model has a high classification accuracy of 82.6%, and can obtain the emotional categories included in interactive music appreciation, which is helpful to guide the mental health of college students in music appreciation teaching.

ID FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION
AB With an increasing number of human-computer interaction application scenarios, researchers are looking for computers to recognize human emotions more accurately and efficiently. Such applications are desperately needed at universities, where people want to understand the students' psychology in real time to avoid catastrophes. This research proposed a self-aware face emotion accelerated recognition algorithm (SFEARA) that improves the efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the recognition of facial emotions. SFEARA will recognize that critical and noncritical regions of input data perform high-precision computation and convolutive low-precision computation during the inference process, and finally combine the results, which can help us get the emotional recognition model for international students. Based on a comparison of experimental data, the SFEARA algorithm has 1.3x to 1.6x higher computational efficiency and 30% to 40% lower energy consumption than conventional CNNs in emotion recognition applications, is better suited to the real-time scenario with more background information.

To alleviate this problem, we propose a self-supervised depth super-resolution method with contrastive multiview pre-training. Unlike existing contrastive learning methods for classification or segmentation tasks, our strategy can be applied to regression tasks even when trained on a small-scale dataset and can reduce information redundancy by extracting unique features from the guide. Furthermore, we propose a novel mutual modulation scheme that can effectively compute the local spatial correlation between cross-modal features. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that our method attains superior performance with respect to state-of-the-art GDSR methods and exhibits good generalization to other modalities.

AB Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is essential for understanding diseases and developing novel treatments. It measures the gene expression of each fine-grained area (i.e., different windows) in the tissue slide with low throughput. This paper proposes an exemplar guided graph network dubbed EGGN to accurately and efficiently predict gene expression from each window of a tissue slide image. We apply exemplar learning to dynamically boost gene expression prediction from nearest/similar exemplars of a given tissue slide image window. Our framework has three main components connected in a sequence: (i) an extractor to structure a feature space for exemplar retrievals; (ii) a graph construction strategy to connect windows and exemplars as a graph; (iii) a graph convolutional network backbone to process window and exemplar features, and a graph exemplar bridging block to adaptively revise the window features using its exemplars. Finally, we complete the gene expression prediction task with a simple attention-based prediction block. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets indicate the superiority of our approach when compared with past state-of-the-art methods. We release our code at https://github.com/Yan98/EGN.

AB Accurate prediction on influent wastewater quality is of great importance to energy saving and chemical dosage reduction of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, the existing methods ignore the data noise caused by water sensors working in harsh conditions and the intrinsic variable dynamics inherent in the time series of wastewater quality. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called wt-ResLSTM (wavelet transform and Residual Long Short -Term Memory) to predict the influent wastewater quality. Specifically, we adopt wavelet transform and semi-soft thresholding to remove the noise from influent wastewater quality data adaptively. Then, we use autoencoder to learn the latent representation of the recent fluctuation of wastewater quality to capture its transient uncertainty. Further, the residual LSTM is adopted to learn both the long-term and short-term sequential dependencies of influent wastewater quality from the historical wastewater quality and the latent representation of its recent fluctuation. Experiments on the dataset from a large-scale urban WWTP in Beijing demonstrate that the proposed wt-ResLSTM approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in predicting influent wastewater quality in terms of level accuracy and directional accuracy.

TI Active learning for medical image segmentation with stochastic batches
SO MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
DE Active learning; Segmentation; Medical image analysis; Uncertainty
AB The performance of learning-based algorithms improves with the amount of labelled data used for training. Yet, manually annotating data is particularly difficult for medical image segmentation tasks because of the limited expert availability and intensive manual effort required. To reduce manual labelling, active learning (AL) targets the most informative samples from the unlabelled set to annotate and add to the labelled training set. On the one hand, most active learning works have focused on the classification or limited segmentation of natural images, despite active learning being highly desirable in the difficult task of medical image segmentation. On the other hand, uncertainty-based AL approaches notoriously offer sub-optimal batch-query strategies, while diversity-based methods tend to be computationally expensive. Over and above methodological hurdles, random sampling has proven an extremely difficult baseline to outperform when varying learning and sampling conditions. This work aims to take advantage of the diversity and speed offered by random sampling to improve the selection of uncertainty-based AL methods for segmenting medical images. More specifically, we propose to compute uncertainty at the level of batches instead of samples through an original use of stochastic batches (SB) during sampling in AL. Stochastic batch querying is a simple and effective addon that can be used on top of any uncertainty-based metric. Extensive experiments on two medical image segmentation datasets show that our strategy consistently improves conventional uncertainty-based sampling methods. Our method can hence act as a strong baseline for medical image segmentation. The code is available on: https://github.com/Minimel/StochasticBatchAL.git.

AB The training of state-of-the-art deep learning models generally requires significant high-quality data, including personal and sensitive data. To ensure privacy of the sensitive data used in training deep learning models, many methods have been designed by the research community. However, it has been observed that many privacy-preserving approaches for image-based deep learning model training incur significant time in the processing of images and/or have low accuracy on trained models when a large number of images is used for classification tasks. Hence, in this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient approach to preserve image privacy while maintaining the availability of the training set. Specifically, we design the pixel block mixing algorithm for facial image classification privacy preservation in deep learning. Experimental findings show that the models trained by the mixed training set generated by the proposed algorithm maintain their availability. The comparison results of the structural similarity index measure between images in the new training set and the original training set show that our scheme preserves image privacy. Our evaluations also reveal that the data augmentation can be applied to the mixed training set to improve the training effectiveness. We also demonstrate it is computationally challenging for attackers to restore the mixed training set to the original one.

AB Image enhancement has recently gained considerable attention owing to its benefits in cleaning input images before final processing and, thus, helping decision systems. The outstanding success of generative adversarial networks has been exploited in image enhancement to handle various image generation challenges, and complex image enhancers incorporating new architectures and/or the use of metrics as loss functions have been proposed. However, degradation-aware loss functions that would help the generator deal with degradation have not been investigated. In this study, we propose a new adversarial learning paradigm, referred to as a degradation-level-based learnable generative adversarial network (DLL-GAN). In addition to the discriminator and L1 losses, a new loss is included in the DLL-GAN; it is calculated by using a convolutional-neural-network -based regressor that estimates the amount of degradation that is still present in the generator output and must be optimized during the learning process. The DLL-GAN is validated on three widely adopted and challenging image enhancement tasks: super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG artifact removal. An extensive experimental analysis reveals that the DLL-GAN improves the baseline performance through significant gains, which are confirmed in visual results. The DLL-GAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in three applications, especially at high and challenging degradation levels.

AB Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been demonstrated to be an effective method for game player expertise level classification, as it can reflect the activity state of the player's brain during the game task. Although many efforts have been made to classify the expertise level of game players based on EEG signals, existing methods still need to be improved in identifying common brain patterns across different subjects. In this article, we propose a Spatiotemporal-Based Brain Pattern Recognition Network (BPR-STNet), which uses depthwise separable convolution to extract the spatiotemporal features of EEG signals and incorporates Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) interpretable technology to explore common brain patterns among different subjects. To evaluate the model's performance, we use non-invasive wearable devices to collect EEG signals from 19 subjects during the game process. The results of the leave-one-out cross-subject experiments demonstrate that the average accuracy of the model's game player expertise level classification is 82%-86.32% in the five frequency bands (6, 0, a, /3, y). Among them, the y frequency band has the highest accuracy of 86.32%. More importantly, the average accuracy of our method is 1.56%-5.79% higher than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, interpretable results indicate the model can learn biologically significant features from EEG frequency bands. Overall, this study can offer a new idea of using deep learning to explore common brain patterns and features among different subjects at the same level. The BPR-STNet code is available at https://github.com/L000077/BPR-STNet.

   Pareto optimization; Directed search
AB This work proposes a novel approach, the stochastic directed search, for optimizing deep neural networks framed as high-dimensional multi-objective problems which typically cannot be addressed with current methods. The proposed algorithm is based on the gradient-based predictor-corrector directed search method and it allows the efficient fine-tuning of a neural network (NN) without retraining the entire model. The contributions include the computation of the Jacobian using batches of data to account for GPU memory limitations, special routines for better approximating boundaries, and an early stopping criterion that limits the search space. Additionally, the proposed method scales well with the problem dimension given that it employs the Jacobian to steer the search in the objective space. The effectiveness of the algorithm is exemplified by fine-tuning a forecasting NN model, responsible for producing multi-horizon quantile forecasts of the S&P 500 Futures financial time series. The stochastic directed search optimizes the neural network in only 1.5% of the training time, i.e. 29.56 s, and the Pareto front obtained shows that variations of around 30% can be obtained for the objective with a degradation of only 5% in the loss function. When solving large problem instances with dimensions up to 240,000, the results show that it outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III by reducing function evaluations by a factor of 100, while increasing by more than 5% the hypervolume of Pareto fronts. Notably, this work showcases how a large NN model can be fine-tuned using a multi-objective framework.

TI Discrete aggregation hashing for image set classification
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

ID REPRESENTATION; SPARSE
AB With the development of vision technology, image set classification (ISC) has flourished in the image processing field. Different from the one-shot image classification, ISC focuses on the set rather than a one-shot image. Hence, ISC can synthesize the abundant set information to alleviate various appearance variations. Despite the great success of the existing ISC methods, there are still some problems: (1) They usually face an expensive time complexity, which directly limits the practical application; (2) They largely ignore the intrinsic relationships between different sets. In light of this, we propose a novel Discrete Aggregation Hashing (DAH) for fast ISC. To be specific, to extract more semantic information from each set and each sample, we adopt the same projection standard to embed dual semantic labels (i.e., sample label and set label) into instance and set hash codes. Then we regard set hash codes as set-specific centers. A hashing aggregation strategy is proposed to learn compact discriminative instance hash codes via iteratively aggregating intrinsic neighborhood representations around each central node. Therefore, instance hash codes can obtain greater intra-set compactness and inter -set separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DAH can obtain promising performance and outperform these state-of-the-art ISC methods on four image set datasets.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Knowledge distillation, a technique recently gaining popularity for enhancing model generalization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), operates under the assumption that both teacher and student models are trained on identical data distributions. However, its effect on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is less than satisfactory since the graph topology and node attributes are prone to evolve, thereby leading to the issue of distribution shift. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by simultaneously training a group of graph neural networks in an online distillation fashion, where the group knowledge plays a role as a dynamic virtual teacher and the structure changes in graph neural networks are effectively captured. To improve the distillation performance, two types of knowledge are transferred among the students to enhance each other: local knowledge reflecting information in the graph topology and node attributes, and global knowledge reflecting the prediction over classes. We transfer the global knowledge with KL-divergence as the vanilla knowledge distillation does, while exploiting the complicated structure of the local knowledge with an efficient adversarial cyclic learning framework. Extensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our proposed online adversarial distillation approach. The code is published at https://github.com/wangz3066/OnlineDistillGCN.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Zero-shot 3D shape understanding aims to recognize "unseen"3D categories that are not present in training data. Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown promising open-world performance in zero-shot 3D shape understanding tasks by information fusion among language and 3D modality. It first renders 3D objects into multiple 2D image views and then learns to understand the semantic relationships between the textual descriptions and images, enabling the model to generalize to new and unseen categories. However, existing studies in zero-shot 3D shape understanding rely on predefined rendering parameters, resulting in repetitive, redundant, and low-quality views. This limitation hinders the model's ability to fully comprehend 3D shapes and adversely impacts the text-image fusion in a shared latent space. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Differentiable rendering-based multi-view Image-Language Fusion (DILF) for zero-shot 3D shape understanding. Specifically, DILF leverages large-scale language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts enriched with 3D semantics and designs a differentiable renderer with learnable rendering parameters to produce representative multi-view images. These rendering parameters can be iteratively updated using a text-image fusion loss, which aids in parameters' regression, allowing the model to determine the optimal viewpoint positions for each 3D object. Then a group-view mechanism is introduced to model interdependencies across views, enabling efficient information fusion to achieve a more comprehensive 3D shape understanding. Experimental results can demonstrate that DILF outperforms state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot 3D classification while maintaining competitive performance for standard 3D classification. The code is available at https://github.com/yuzaiyang123/DILP.

AB Hidden Markov chains (HMCs) are widely used in unsupervised Bayesian hidden discrete data restoration. They are very robust and, in spite of their simplicity, they are sufficiently efficient in many cases. However, in complex situations, extensions of HMCs models are of interest. In particular, when sojourn time in hidden states is not geometrical, hidden semi-Markov chains (HSMCs) may work better. Besides, hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs) showed its interest in non-stationary situations. In this paper, we propose a new model simultaneously extending HSMCs and HEMCs. Based on triplet Markov chains (TMCs), it is used in an unsupervised framework, parameters being estimated with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We validate its interest through some experiments on hand-drawn images noised with artificial noises. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Multi-aspect preferences; Multi-aspect intents; Multi-behavioral
   sequential recommendation
AB Multi-behavioral sequential recommendation has recently attracted increasing attention. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations. Firstly, user preferences and intents can be described in fine-grained detail from multiple perspectives; yet, these methods fail to capture their multi-aspect nature. Secondly, user behaviors may contain noises, and most existing methods could not effectively deal with noises. In this paper, we present an attentive recurrent model with multiple projections to capture Multi -Aspect preferences and INTents (MAINT in short). To extract multi-aspect preferences from target behaviors, we propose a multi-aspect projection mechanism for generating multiple preference representations from multiple aspects. To extract multi-aspect intents from multi-typed behaviors, we propose a behavior-enhanced LSTM and a multi-aspect refinement attention mechanism. The attention mechanism can filter out noises and generate multiple intent representations from different aspects. To adaptively fuse user preferences and intents, we propose a multi -aspect gated fusion mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model.

ID RECOGNITION; VIDEOS
AB Given an egocentric video, action temporal segmentation aims to temporally segment the video into basic units, each depicting an action. As the camera is constantly moving, some important objects may disappear in some consecutive frames and cause an abrupt change in the visual content. Recently works fail to deal with this condition in the absence of manually annotating abundant frames. In this study, we propose a temporal-aware clustering method for egocentric action temporal segmentation: a self-supervised temporal autoencoder (SSTAE). Instead of directly learning visual features, the SSTAE is implemented by encoding the preceding target frame and predicting subsequent frames in the temporal relationship domain, which takes into account the local temporal consistency. Our proposed algorithm is guided by the reconstruction and predicted losses. Consequently, local temporal contexts are naturally integrated into the feature representation, and a clustering step is performed. Experiments on three egocentric datasets demonstrate the our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by clustering Accuracy(ACC) 7.57%, Normalized Mutual Information(NMI) 8.17%, Adjusted Rand Index(ARI) 8.6%.

   wavelet packet transform; Noisy industrial scenarios
AB The application of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based fault diagnosis methods has shown significant efficacy in industrial settings, facilitating the transfer of operational experience and fault signatures between different operating conditions, different units of a fleet or between simulated and real data. However, in real industrial scenarios, unknown levels and types of noise can amplify the difficulty of domain alignment, thus severely affecting the diagnostic performance of deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose an UDA method called Smart Filter-Aided Domain Adversarial Neural Network (SFDANN) for fault diagnosis in noisy industrial scenarios. The proposed methodology comprises two steps. In the first step, we develop a smart filter that dynamically enforces similarity between the source and target domain data in the time-frequency domain. This is achieved by combining a learnable wavelet packet transform network (LWPT) and a traditional wavelet packet transform module. In the second step, we input the data reconstructed by the smart filter into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN). To learn domain-invariant and discriminative features, the learnable modules of SFDANN are trained in a unified manner with three objectives: time-frequency feature proximity, domain alignment, and fault classification. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SFDANN method based on two fault diagnosis cases: one involving fault diagnosis of bearings in noisy environments and another involving fault diagnosis of slab tracks in a train-track-bridge coupling vibration system, where the transfer task involves transferring from numerical simulations to field measurements. Results show that compared to other representative state of the art UDA methods, SFDANN exhibits superior performance and remarkable stability.

AB Since there have been more and more incidents of women being harassed in the recent past, girls need to think twice before going out of their houses. Sometimes, they are not even safe in their house or workplace. These circumstance does not change for children of all genders who stay alone because of their working parents or for other reasons. Also, there is no such organized procedure to ensure safety and take women and children out of such violence and harassment. To address this problem, the authors of this paper developed an Android -based automated system to detect danger for women and children using audio from the surroundings. As the Android phone is available to everyone nowadays, they focused on using this device rather than developing a system on some external hardware. Different signal processing methods with deep learning techniques are used for this work. This work also addresses noise from the environment for any chaos and nullifies them using different noise reduction techniques such as Reduce Energy Noise, Reduce Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) up Noise, Reduce Median Noise, Reduce Centroid Noise, Audio DeNoise, Noisereduce by Sainburf et al. & Butterworth high pass filter. The Noisereduce by Sainburg et al. along with the InceptionV3 model architecture turns out to be the best to classify audio with 95.51% accuracy. A new model called AudioViT is introduced. It uses a Visual Transformer and Residual Network to identify the audio signal. The Android application also takes necessary action when any unfavorable situation is detected. Android device users can use this application without any cost, which will pave the way to ensure the safety of women and children.

AB The leading cause of vision loss globally is diabetic retinopathy. Researchers are making great efforts to automatically detect and diagnose correctly diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy includes five stages: no diabetic retinopathy, mild diabetic retinopathy, moderate diabetic retinopathy, severe diabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Recent studies have offered several multi-tasking deep learning models to detect and assess the level of diabetic retinopathy. However, the explanation for the assessment of disease severity of these models is limited, and only stops at showing lesions through images. These studies have not explained on what basis the appraisal of disease severity is based. In this article, we present a system for assessing and interpreting the five stages of diabetic retinopathy. The proposed system is built from internal models including a deep learning model that detects lesions and an explanatory model that assesses disease stage. The deep learning model that detects lesions uses the Mask R-CNN deep learning network to specify the location and shape of the lesion and classify the lesion types. This model is a combination of two networks: one used to detect hemorrhagic and exudative lesions, and one used to detect vascular lesions like aneurysm and proliferation. The explanatory model appraises disease severity based on the severity of each type of lesion and the association between types. The severity of the disease will be decided by the model based on the number of lesions, the density and the area of the lesions. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves high accuracy of assessing five stages of diabetic retinopathy comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods and is capable of explaining the causes of disease severity.

AB The present article proposes a probabilistic weighted high-order fuzzy time series (FTS) forecasting model employing Bayesian network (BN) to address complex relationships and uncertainty hidden in time series. As considerable FTS forecasting models considers the fuzzy relationships between precedent moments and the consequent moment as the complex relationships in time series, BN structure learning is utilized to discover and model dependence relationships between each moment in time series. The combination of the fuzzy relationships modeled by fuzzy logical relationships and the dependence relationships modeled by the BN provides a comprehensive establishment and representation of the complex relationships inherent in time series data. The proposed FTS forecasting method calculates the fuzzy-probabilistic weights of each fuzzy logical relationship group using the improved fuzzy empirical probabilities to model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in time series. To this end, the improved fuzzy empirical probabilities are formulated by integrating fuzzy empirical probabilities with the BN to incorporate dependence relationships from the original time series into the FTS forecasting procedure. The efficiency of the proposed forecasting model is validated on fourteen publicly available time series. Experimental results confirm the better performance of the proposed method comparing with nine existing FTS models and six numeric models. Hypothesis tests also validate the robustness and reliability of the proposed method.

AB Human behavior recognition plays a crucial role in the field of smart education. It offers a nuanced understanding of teaching and learning dynamics by revealing the behaviors of both teachers and students. In this study, to address the exigencies of teaching behavior analysis in smart education, we first constructed a teaching behavior analysis dataset called EuClass. EuClass contains 13 types of teacher/student behavior categories and provides multi-view, multi-scale video data for the research and practical applications of teacher/student behavior recognition. We also provide a teaching behavior analysis network containing an attention-based network and an intra-class differential representation learning module. The attention mechanism uses a two-level attention module encompassing spatial and channel dimensions. The intra-class differential representation learning module utilized a unified loss function to reduce the distance between features. Experiments conducted on the EuClass dataset and a widely used action/gesture recognition dataset, IsoGD, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, with the recognition accuracy increased by 1-2% on average.

AB For a nonlinear parabolic distributed parameter system (DPS), a fuzzy boundary sampled-data (SD) control method is introduced in this article, where distributed SD measurement and boundary SD measurement are respected. Initially, this nonlinear parabolic DPS is represented precisely by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) model. Subsequently, under distributed SD measurement and boundary SD measurement, a fuzzy boundary SD control design is obtained via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) on the basis of the T-S fuzzy parabolic PDE model to guarantee exponential stability for closed-loop parabolic DPS by using inequality techniques and a LF. Furthermore, respecting the property of membership functions, we present some LMI-based fuzzy boundary SD control design conditions. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed fuzzy boundary SD controller is demonstrated via two simulation examples.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used in many quantum control tasks, in which rewards are used to guide the agent in acquiring an optimal control strategy. However, designing suitable rewards is usually challenging, which seriously affects the DRL 's application performance, especially for complex quantum control tasks. In this article, we propose a simple and general reward design method by constructing some events, where events are defined by fidelity intervals. In the proposed event-based DRL (EDRL), events are used to describe the evolution of a quantum system. Rewards are designed according to several defined events rather than a large number of specific evolved quantum states, thereby resulting in a reduction in dimensions to be considered. With designed event-attributed rewards, the agent can capture the main evolution characteristics of a quantum system, and then obtain an effective control strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed EDRL method is verified by three quantum systems: i.e., 1) the one-qubit closed quantum system, 2) the two-qubit closed quantum system, and 3) the two-level open quantum system. Numerical comparisons demonstrate that the proposed EDRL outperforms the traditional DRL algorithms (deep Q-network and proximal policy optimization) with some representative reward methods for solving quantum control problems.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Contrastive learning; few-shot learning; information extraction; named
   entity recognition (NER); prompting
AB Prompt tuning has achieved great success in various sentence-level classification tasks by using elaborated label word mappings and prompt templates. However, for solving token-level classification tasks, e.g., named entity recognition (NER), previous research, which utilizes N-gram traversal for prompting all spans with all possible entity types, is time-consuming. To this end, we propose a novel prompt-based contrastive learning method for few-shot NER without template construction and label word mappings. First, we leverage external knowledge to initialize semantic anchors for each entity type. These anchors are simply appended with input sentence embeddings as template-free prompts (TFPs). Then, the prompts and sentence embeddings are in-context optimized with our proposed semantic-enhanced contrastive loss. Our proposed loss function enables contrastive learning in few-shot scenarios without requiring a significant number of negative samples. Moreover, it effectively addresses the issue of conventional contrastive learning, where negative instances with similar semantics are erroneously pushed apart in natural language processing (NLP)-related tasks. We examine our method in label extension (LE), domain-adaption (DA), and low-resource generalization evaluation tasks with six public datasets and different settings, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in most cases.

AB Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities can significantly advance the development of drug discovery. Several graph neural network (GNN)-based methods learn representations of protein-ligand complexes via modeling intermolecule interactions and spatial structures (e.g., distances and angles) of complexes. However, these methods fail to emphasize the importance of bonds and learn hierarchical structures of complexes, which are significant for binding affinity prediction. In this article, we propose the structure-aware graph attention diffusion network (SGADN) to incorporate both distance and angle information for efficient spatial structure learning. We model complexes as line graphs with distance and angle information, focusing on bonds as nodes. Then we perform line graph attention diffusion layers (LGADLs) on line graphs to explore long-range bond node interactions and enhance spatial structure learning. Furthermore, we propose an attentive pooling layer (APL) to refine the hierarchical structures in complexes. Extensive experimental studies on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SGADN for binding affinity prediction.

DE Fetal electrocardiogram; Deep learning; QRS-complex
AB Fetal heart monitoring during pregnancy plays a critical role in diagnosing congenital heart disease (CHD). A noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) provides additional clinical information for fetal heart monitoring. To date, the analysis of noninvasive fECG is challenging due to the cancellation of maternal QRS-complexes, despite significant advances in electrocardiography. Fetal QRS-complex is highly considered to measure fetal heart rate to detect some fetal abnormalities such as arrhythmia. In this study, we proposed a deep learning (DL) framework that stacked a convolutional layer and bidirectional long short-term memory for fetal QRS-complexes classification. The fECG signals are first preprocessed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to remove the noise or inferences. The following step beats and QRS-complex segmentation. The last step is fetal QRS-complex classification based on DL. In the experiment of Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2013, this study achieved 100% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. A stacked DL model demonstrates an effective tool for fetal QRS-complex classification and contributes to clinical applications for long-term maternal and fetal monitoring.

AB The study of logistics distribution network under e-commerce environment is conducive to the establishment of efficient logistics distribution system, but also to promote the further development of e-commerce and improve social benefits of great significance. This study considers multiple fuzzy factors and introduces a customer fuzzy time window with variable coefficients, establishes a multi-objective set allocation integrated multi-level location path planning model, and proposes an archive type multi-objective simulated annealing improvement algorithm based on master-slave parallel framework embedded taboo search to solve the model. Tabu search and large-scale neighborhood algorithm are used to solve the initial solutions of the first level network and the second level network respectively, and archival reception criterion is introduced to deal with the multi-objective problem. The results of the proposed algorithm for the two-level site-routing problem are less than 6% different from the internationally known optimal solution. The master-slave parallel computing framework improves the efficiency of the algorithm by about 6.38%. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and necessity of the improved optimization. In addition, this study simulates the site-routing problem model constructed by the study by extending the data of standard examples. The experimental results prove the correctness and reference significance of the multilevel site-routing problem model with multiple fuzzy factors.

AB The trend of Chinese enterprises has defied the hard-hit international investment and trade activities of recent years. The scale and globalization of local enterprises continue to develop, and the enterprise management efficiency has become increasingly prominent. This paper delves into the strategic importance of FSSC in augmenting corporate value, and examines the link between digital transformation and the formation of FSSC. The introduction of FSSC and its accompanying digital technology marks a new juncture for corporate reform. Based on RBV and DCV, this paper studies the strategic significance of FSSC to enhance corporate value, and deconstructs the relationship between digital transformation and the development process of financial shared service centers. Based on the time-varying DID, 335 listed companies were selected for a quasi-natural experiment. The results showed that: (1) financial shared service centers can significantly promote the improvement of corporate value. (2) Digital transformation can promote the establishment and development of financial sharing service centers, thus promoting the improvement of corporate value. (3) The effects of FSSC and digital transformation are characterized by heterogeneity. The worth of financial shared service centers for non-state-owned and manufacturing companies is substantial. Digital transformation has a noteworthy positive moderating effect on them but has no considerable moderating effect on state-owned and non-manufacturing companies. The government ought to bolster policy direction, keep up the digital transformation of businesses, and aid them in achieving rapid financial transformation; senior executives should remain cognizant of their strategic position and strive to execute a satisfactory job of both internal and external coordination, as the research findings suggest.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has caused drastic fluctuations in the economies of various countries. Meanwhile, the governments' ability to save the economy depends on how banks provide credit to troubled companies. Therefore, the impact of the epidemic on bank credit and inclusive finance are worth exploring. However, most of the existing studies focus on the reform of the financial and economic system, only paying attention to the theoretical mechanism analysis and effect adjustment, scant data support, and insufficient scheme landing. At the same time, with the rise and rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, all walks of life have introduced it into real scenes for multi-source heterogeneous big data analysis and decision-making assistance. Therefore, we first take the Chinese mainland as an example in this paper. By studying the impact of the epidemic on bank credit preference and the mechanism of inclusive finance, we can provide objective decision-making basis for the financial system in the post-epidemic era to better flow credit funds into various entities and form a new perspective for related research. Then, we put forward a model based on Bi-directional Long Short-term Memory Network (BiLSTM) and Attention Mechanism to predict the number of newly diagnosed cases during the COVID-19 pandemic every day. It is not only suitable for COVID-19 pandemic data characterized by time series and nonlinearity, but also can adaptively select the most relevant input data by introducing an Attention Mechanism, which can solve the problems of huge calculation and inaccurate prediction results. Finally, through experiments and empirical research, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will promote enterprises to increase credit. (2) Banks provide more credit to large enterprises. (3) The epidemic has different impacts on credit in different regions, with the most significant one on central China. (4) Banks tend to provide more credit to manufacturing industries under the epidemic. (5) Digital inclusive finance plays a (positive) regulating effect on bank credit in COVID-19 pandemic. Inspired by the research results, policymakers can consider further solving the information asymmetry and strengthening the construction of a credit system, and more direct financial support policies for enterprises should be adopted. (6) By adopting the COVID-19 prediction model based on the BiLSTM-Attention network to accurately predict the epidemic situation in the COVID-19 pandemic, it can provide an important basis for the formulation of epidemic prevention and control policies.

AB In order to improve the accuracy of e-commerce credit risk assessment, this paper suggests utilizing an artificial immune network to upgrade the text mining algorithm. Through this process, a new e-commerce risk assessment model reliant on the improved algorithm can be constructed with the intention of decreasing the likelihood of risk in digital transactions. The results show that the accuracy and loss rate of the improved clustering algorithm are 97.3% and 4.3%, respectively, both of which are better than the comparison algorithm. Then, the empirical analysis of the e-commerce credit risk assessment model proposed in the study shows that the average fitness and accuracy of the model after stability are 0.0022 and 95.63%, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the comparison model. The above results show that the improved algorithm and the risk assessment model have good performance. Therefore, using this model to evaluate the credit risk of e-commerce can not only improve the accuracy of credit evaluation and promote the sustainable development of e-commerce. Furthermore, it can catalyze the adoption of innovative credit evaluation methods and promote the application of artificial intelligence technology in e-commerce.

ID DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; MULTIMODAL OPTIMIZATION
AB Real-world optimization problems often have multiple optimal solutions and simultaneously finding these optimal solutions is beneficial yet challenging. Brain storm optimization (BSO) is a relatively new paradigm of swarm intelligence algorithm that has been shown to be effective in solving global optimization problems, but it has not been fully exploited for multimodal optimization problems. A simple control strategy for the step size parameter in BSO cannot meet the need of optima finding task in multimodal landscapes and can possibly be refined and optimized. In this paper, we propose an adaptive BSO (ABSO) algorithm that adaptively adjusts the step size parameter according to the quality of newly created solutions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a set of multimodal optimization problems to evaluate the performance of ABSO and the experimental results show that ABSO outperforms existing BSO algorithms and some recently developed algorithms. BSO has great potential in multimodal optimization and is expected to be useful for solving real-world optimization problems that have multiple optimal solutions.

AB Approximately 45% of ship delivery delays are due to welding quality. To solve the problematic control of production tempo and process sequence optimization in the welding process, it is urgent to combine the characteristics of the digital twin for dynamic simulation and optimization. Therefore, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization for the ship welding production line (WPL) based on the digital twin is proposed. Firstly, to describe the construction method of the digital twin model and digital twin data, a strategy is proposed for the construction of a digital twin ship component WPL model. Based on the fusion mapping of model and data, the construction of the digital twin model for WPL (DTM-WPL) is achieved. Secondly, by using equipment failure rate, processing time and buffer capacity as evaluation indicators, an WPL optimization model based on digital twins is constructed to solve the WPL production sequencing problem. Thirdly, to illustrate the welding quality traceability and prediction process, a DTM-WPL synchronous mapping for quality prediction and adjustment method is proposed. Finally, taking small and medium-sized WPL as the research object, the capacity evaluation and scheduling optimization system of ship components is developed to evaluate the production capacity of ship components. The validation results indicate that the optimized process scheme has increased production efficiency by 7.27%.

AB This article presents a novel algorithm that accurately predicts market trends and identifies trading entry points for US 30-year Treasury bonds. The proposed method employs a hybrid approach, integrating a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN), long-short term memory (LSTM), and XGBoost algorithms. The 1DCNN is used to learn local and short-term patterns, while LSTM is employed to capture both short and long-term dependencies. Furthermore, we have implemented an algorithm that utilizes hull moving average (HMA) and simple moving average (SMA) crossover data to detect trading entry points and major trends in the market. The combination of the SMA-HMA crossover algorithm and predictions provided by the 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm yields exceptional results in terms of prediction accuracy and profitability. Additionally, these integrated techniques effectively filter out noise and mitigate false breakouts, which are often observed with US 30-year Treasury bonds. In the field of financial time series prediction, the effectiveness of 1DCNN and LSTM in identifying trading entry points and market perturbations has not been comprehensively studied. Therefore, our work fills this gap by demonstrating through experiments that the proposed 1DCNN-BiLSTM-XGBoost algorithm, in combination with moving average crossovers, effectively reduces noise and market perturbations. This leads to the precise identification of trading entry points and accurate recognition of trend signals for US 30-year Treasury bonds. We demonstrate through experiments that our proposed approach achieves an average root mean squared error of 0.0001 and an R-square value of 0.9999, highlighting its promise as a method for predicting market trends and trading entry points for US 30-year Treasury bonds.

AB Artificial intelligence decision systems play an important supporting role in the field of medical information. Medical image analysis is an important part of decision systems and an even more important part of medical diagnosis and treatment. The wealth of cellular information in histopathological images makes them a reliable means of diagnosing tumors. However, due to the large size, high resolution, and complex background structure of pathology images, deep learning methods still have various difficulties in the recognition of pathology images. Based on this, this study proposes a two-stage continuous improvement-based approach for pathology image recognition in medical decision systems. For pathology images with complex backgrounds, normalization and enhancement is performed to remove the effects of noise color, and light-dark inconsistencies on the segmentation network. The continuous refinement PSP Net (CRPSPNet) is then designed for accurate recognition of the pathology images. CRPSPNet is divided into two stages: Pyramid Scene Parsing Network segmentation to obtain coarse segmentation results; and continuous refinement model refines the results of the first stage. Experiments using more than 1,000 osteosarcoma pathology images have shown that the method gives more accurate results with fewer computer resources and processing time than traditional optimization models. Its Intersection over Union achieves 0.76.
   We propose a fine segmentation method for pathology images based on continuous improvement. In this method, we first find the ROI of the pathology image using the OSTU algorithm in order to crop out the regions where cell nuclei are clustered and perform pre-processing and semantic segmentation on the cropped image.image

AB Software architecture security design is a key stage in developing business-oriented system, such as business-critical system, ICT system and AI system. Many typical accidents also remind us that the security of software architecture even plays a more important role than the code security in most software systems. However, there are very few researches which focus on the security of software architecture. Especially, we don't find a systematic and feasible quantitative method to evaluate the security of software architecture. To fill this gap, we launched a research project focusing on software architecture security since 2019 and try to provide a series of quantitative methods for evaluating the security of software architecture. In this paper, a business-oriented quantitative method was proposed to evaluate the security of software architecture from the view of business-critical security insurance. In our method, both business dependency graph (BDG) and multi-hierarchical dependency graph (MHDG) are defined and constructed first for describing businesses and their relationships, and system components and their relationships; then, attack points and business key-points are identified and labeled on BDG and MHDG; and further, all potential attack paths and effective attack paths in the system based on MHDG are detected; and finally, a set of security indicators is defined and used to evaluate the security of software architecture quantitatively. For more effective experiments, we use software architectures with different styles and different evolution versions. Experimental results show that our method can reflect effectively the security characteristics of software architecture with different styles, can find the security changes of different architecture evolution versions for the same system, and can perform quantitative evaluation of software architecture security efficiently.

AB Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a type of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. The GWO has strong local search ability and fast convergence. Moreover, GWO is easily implemented due to its small number of parameters and unique population structure. Nevertheless, GWO still has the shortcoming of low accuracy, and it is easy to fall in local optima. To overcome this shortcoming, an ameliorated grey wolf optimizer (AGWO) is proposed in this paper. In the AGWO, an opposition-based learning strategy is employed to optimize the GWO algorithm for making a balance between exploration and exploitation. This process can efficiently prevent the AGWO from falling into a local optimum. In addition, to solve the problems of dimensional degradation and computational complexity in opposition-based learning, orthogonal design is introduced to reverse in certain dimensions. At the same time, to reduce the calculation time of the algorithm, two most representative individuals (the best individual and the worst individual) are selected to perform orthogonal opposition-based learning. The proposed AGWO is evaluated on 23 benchmark functions and the well-known IEEE CEC2022 benchmark suite. Based on the simulation results, it is observed that AGWO achieves superior solution compared to GWO and most algorithms. Moreover, AGWO is utilized to optimize the parameters of three engineering design problems, and the results show that AGWO can solve real-world engineering problems.

ID DESIGN OPTIMIZATION
AB Jaya is a metaheuristic algorithm that uses a pair of random internal parameters to adjust its exploration and exploitation search behaviors. Such a random setting can negatively affect the search performance of the algorithm by causing inappropriate search behavior in some iterations. To tackle this issue, the present study deals with developing a new fuzzy decision-making mechanism for dynamic adjusting the trade-off between the exploration and exploitation search behaviors of the Jaya method. The new algorithm is named Fuzzy Reinforced Jaya (FRJ) method. The search capability of the FRJ is evaluated in solving a suite of unconstrained mathematical benchmarks and constrained mechanical and structural optimization problems with buckling and natural frequency constraints. Also, the relevant decision variables are selected from both continuous and discrete domains. To provide a deeper insight into the effect of the defined auxiliary fuzzy module, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated and discussed using normalized diversity concept and behavioral diagrams. Also, employing different statistical analyses (e.g., Q-Q diagrams, Wilcoxson and Friedman tests), the significance of the outcomes is evaluated. Also, the numeric achievements are compared with six other well-stablished techniques. Attained outcomes indicate that the proposed FRJ, as a self-adaptive and parameter-free method, provides superior and promising results in the terms of stability, accuracy, and computational cost in solving mathematical and structural optimization problems.

AB The effectiveness of machine learning approaches depends on the quality of the data representation. In fact, some representations may mislead such learning approaches upon concealing relevant explanatory variables. Although feature engineering, that utilizes domain knowledge and/or expert supervision, yields typical data representation techniques, generic unsupervised feature learning represents an even more objective alternative to determine relevant attributes and generate optimal feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy unsupervised feature learning approach (FUL) that automatically derives new features by revealing the intrinsic structure of the data. In fact, FUL exploits the clusters and the associated fuzzy memberships generated by a fuzzy C-means algorithm, and devises new basis functions and their corresponding representation. The experiments results showed that FUL overtakes relevant state of the art approaches. It yielded the highest F1-measure with an improvement of 8%, 11%, 3%, and 4% on Parkinson, Epilepsy, Gait, and breast cancer datasets, respectively.

AB A key issue in tackling multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MMOPs) is achieving the balance between objective space diversity and decision space diversity to obtain multiple Pareto sets (PSs) while guaranteeing convergence to the Pareto front (PF). However, most of the existing methods for MMOPs face the following two shortages: (i) they put insufficient emphasis on improving decision space diversity, resulting in missing some PSs or PS segments; and (ii) they lack the utilization of promising historical individuals which may help search the PSs. To alleviate these limitations, this paper proposes a novel multi-stage evolutionary algorithm with two improved optimization strategies. Specifically, the proposed method decomposes solving MMOP into two tasks, i.e., the Exploration task and the Exploitation task. The Exploration task first aims to explore the decision space to detect the multiple PSs, then, the Exploitation task aims to enhance the diversities on both objective and decision spaces (i.e., exploiting the PF and PSs). To better search PSs, historical individuals that are well-distributed in the decision space are stored as the evolutionary experience, and then used to generate offspring individuals. Moreover, a new differential evolution is designed to force crowded individuals to move to sparse and undetected regions on the PSs to enhance the diversity of PSs. Extensive experimental studies compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art methods tailored for MMOPs on two benchmark test suites. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform others in terms of three performance indicators.

AB Pedestrian gender classification (PGC) is a key task in full-body-based pedestrian image analysis and has become an important area in applications like content-based image retrieval, visual surveillance, smart city, and demographic collection. In the last decade, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have appeared with great potential and with reliable choices for vision tasks, such as object classification, recognition, detection, etc. But CNN has a limited local receptive field that prevents them from learning information about the global context. In contrast, a vision transformer (ViT) is a better alternative to CNN because it utilizes a self-attention mechanism to attend to a different patch of an input image. In this work, generic and effective modules such as locality self-attention (LSA), and shifted patch tokenization (SPT)-based vision transformer model are explored for the PGC task. With the use of these modules in ViT, it is successfully able to learn from stretch even on small-size (SS) datasets and overcome the lack of locality inductive bias. Through extensive experimentation, we found that the proposed ViT model produced better results in terms of overall and mean accuracies. The better results confirm that ViT outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) PGC methods.

DE Clustering; Incremental learning; Human action recognition; Open world
AB Open-world recognition (OWR) is an important field of research that strives to develop machine learning models capable of identifying and learning new classes as they appear. Concurrently, human action recognition (HAR) has received increasing attention from the research community. We approach Open-World HAR in the unsupervised setting. In unsupervised OWR, class labels are available for the initial classes but not for new ones. Hence, we propose a clustering method to label unknown classes automatically for incremental learning (IL). Our framework consists of an Initial Learning phase for initializing the models, an open-set recognition phase for identifying unknown classes, an Automatic Clustering phase for estimating the number of clusters and generating labels, and an IL phase for incorporating new knowledge. The proposed framework was evaluated at each phase separately in eleven experimental settings of the UCF-101 dataset. We also presented parameter sensitivity studies of the main parameters and visual analysis of misclassified videos, revealing interesting visual similarities between overlapped classes. Experiments have shown promising results in all phases of Open-World HAR, even without labels, which closely resembles real-world problems.

ID REVERSIBLE WATERMARKING; SCHEME
AB This paper proposes a robust watermarking method against high-density salt and pepper noise attacks. Automatic region of interest (ROI) detection, embedding encoded data, removing different densities of noise, data extraction by omitting, and labeling the noisy pixels of Region of Non-Interest (RONI), and decoding the extracted data using ROI pixel information as a key, are various steps of the presented scheme. The automatic ROI detection method separates the RONI from ROI with four vertices of the smallest rectangle, for the embedding process. The encoded watermark data is embedded into the least significant bits of RONI in four neighbour pixels. Adaptive Removal of high-density Salt and pepper Noise method can enhance image quality and reduce the effect of salt and pepper noise attacks. The embedded information is preserved from destruction if the host image is impaired through the power of robustness. The best results are obtained through the action of extracting the watermark from RONI pixels, utilizing the same ROI detection method. Omitting and labeling the noisy pixels of the RONI will ensure healthy extracted watermark data, leading to decreased Bit Error Rate (BER) values. Finally, these data are interpreted using the key of ROI pixels, and the watermark data is decoded and retrieved. Due to salt and pepper noise obliterating pixel bits and their corresponding transform coefficients in the transform domain, the spatial domain is employed to enhance robustness against such attacks. The results show the high performance of the presented scheme. The average BER value for five MRI databases in a 97% salt and pepper noise attack is 38.6.
   The high-performance ARSPN method decreases the effect and amount of noise attack and increases the image quality.For watermark extraction, if the RONI noisy pixels are ignored and labeled, the extracted data are healthy and lead to decreasing the BER.The extracted data are interpreted using the key of ROI pixels, and the watermark data are decoded and retrieved.image

AB Oritatami is a mathematical model of co-transcriptional folding, a phenomenon in which, while being synthesized (transcribed) sequentially, an RNA sequence folds upon itself into complex structures via hydrogen bonds between its nucleotides (A, C, G, and U). RNA sequences fold co-transcriptionally to perform computations in-vivo such as gene expression regulation and splicing. Co-transcriptional folding has been recently proven modularly programmable for assembling structures in-vitro in the RNA origami framework as well as for computing arbitrary computable functions in-silico using the oritatami model. In this tutorial, we overview computations in oritatami and their "bricks" to build up from, that is, modules, and then discuss what should be done along with concrete open problems as a seed for further fruitful developments in computation by co-transcriptional folding.

ID VISION
AB Traditional approaches to improving basketball players' shooting skills rely on coaches' experience in adjusting players' biomechanical motions. However, such an approach cannot provide specific instructions or facilitate immediate feedback for improvement of the shooting motion. In this article, a method is presented to quantitatively evaluate four key action indicators of shooting basketballs using a machine-learning model based on Bayesian optimization of a light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). Important motion data for the model are collected by micro-inertial measurement units embedded in a wrist motion sensor and an internet of things (IoT) smart basketball. Basketball shooting motion data are collected from 16 subjects and used for model training and data testing, and four important action indicators that influence the shot quality are selected for quantitative assessment. The LightGBM model is then developed for the regression prediction of the four action indicators of shooting. In the results, it is indicated that for an individual player, the highest correlation scores of the four indexes range from 97.6% to 99.3%. The proposed approach for quantitatively assessing shooting indexes can provide objective and data-based guidance to improve players' shooting performance. Foreseeably, the prediction model can be embedded into a chip of a wearable device to evaluate the real-time shot quality quantitatively.
   System architecture is proposed to quantitatively assess the key action indicators in basketball shooting. Herein, inertial sensors, smart basketball, and cameras are used to collect data. The relative indicators of elbow abduction angle are obtained by using OpenPose. The light gradient boosting machine model combined with Bayesian optimization is used to quantify the four shooting indicators.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Dangerous driving behavior is a major contributing factor to road traffic accidents. Identifying and intervening in drivers' unsafe driving behaviors is thus crucial for preventing accidents and ensuring road safety. However, many of the existing methods for monitoring drivers' behaviors rely on computer vision technology, which has the potential to invade privacy. This paper proposes a radar-based deep learning method to analyze driver behavior. The method utilizes FMCW radar along with TOF radar to identify five types of driving behavior: normal driving, head up, head twisting, picking up the phone, and dancing to music. The proposed model, called RFDANet, includes two parallel forward propagation channels that are relatively independent of each other. The range-Doppler information from the FMCW radar and the position information from the TOF radar are used as inputs. After feature extraction by CNN, an attention mechanism is introduced into the deep architecture of the branch layer to adjust the weight of different branches. To further recognize driving behavior, LSTM is used. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by actual driving data. The results indicate that the average accuracy of each of the five types of driving behavior is 94.5%, which shows the advantage of using the proposed deep learning method. Overall, the experimental results confirm that the proposed method is highly effective for detecting drivers' behavior.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB The fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) algorithm is widely used in greyscale and colour image segmentation, especially in real colour images. However, in the process of interested regions extraction, it performs barely satisfactory due to the use of single distance metric in traditional FCM. In order to address the issue, a fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm based on superpixel merging and multi-feature adaptive fusion measurement (FCM-SM) are proposed. First of all, since superpixel image adapts well to irregular image boundaries, the FCM algorithm is elevated to the superpixel level. Moreover, the superpixel merging module based on colour similarity is introduced to improve the traditional watershed transformation by incorporating more gradient and intensity information. Finally, the multi-feature adaptive fusion measurement is designed in the clustering process to incorporate multiple sources of spatial information, which comprehensively measures the information from different fields to enhance the segmentation capability further. Experiments performed on Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and Brain Tumor Segmentation Dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides better segmentation results than benchmarks during the object extraction.
   A fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm based on superpixel merging and multi-feature adaptive fusion measurement (FCM-SM) is proposed. First, the gradient and color similarity are considered by proposing a superpixel merging module based on to obtain more information. Additionally, the multi-feature adaptive fusion measurement is integrated into the clustering process to combine the multiple information.image

AB Emotion plays a crucial role in human communication, as it adds depth and richness to conversations. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing conversation systems with the ability to generate emotions. However, to create more engaging and realistic interactions, it is essential to consider the influence of personality on emotion generation. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines personality modeling with emotion generation for conversation systems. By incorporating personality traits into the emotion generation process, we aim to create more personalized and contextually appropriate emotional responses. Drawing from BigFive model and emotion computation techniques, our model takes into account individual differences in personality to generate emotions that align with each user's unique characteristics. Experiments show that combining emotion modeling with personality in a dialogue system helps improve the performance of emotion generation models. Additionally, it is also verified that our approach outperforms other baselines on several metrics.

DE Neural radiance field; Dense correspondence; Generative modeling; Shape
   analysis; Computer vision; Computer graphics
AB The neural radiance field (NeRF) has shown promising results in preserving the fine details of objects and scenes. However, unlike explicit shape representations e.g., mesh, it remains an open problem to build dense correspondences across different NeRFs of the same category, which is essential in many downstream tasks. The main difficulties of this problem lie in the implicit nature of NeRF and the lack of ground-truth correspondence annotations. In this paper, we show it is possible to bypass these challenges by leveraging the rich semantics and structural priors encapsulated in a pre-trained NeRF-based GAN. Specifically, we exploit such priors from three aspects, namely (1) a dual deformation field that takes latent codes as global structural indicators, (2) a learning objective that regards generator features as geometric-aware local descriptors, and (3) a source of infinite object-specific NeRF samples. Our experiments demonstrate that such priors lead to 3D dense correspondence that is accurate, smooth, and robust. We also show that established dense correspondence across NeRFs can effectively enable many NeRF-based downstream applications such as texture transfer.

AB The goal of this study is to provide a framework for a novel concept, which is highly effective at expressing ambiguous information in two dimensions. As a result, of the absence of a neutral degree in interval-valued complex Pythagorean fuzzy sets, we developed the theory of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy sets. Moreover, a network security system prevents a variety of potential threats from entering or spreading within a network, thereby protecting a company's infrastructure from damage. This is a broad and comprehensive term that refers to processes, regulations, and settings pertaining to network use, accessibility, and overall threat prevention, as well as hardware and software solutions. It is the field of cybersecurity that focuses on protecting computer networks against cyber threats. To represent and solve the given problem, we establish the new mathematical concept known as interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations, defined as the cartesian product of two interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy sets. Furthermore, a range of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations has been developed, characterized by interesting properties and outcomes. The interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy set and interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations supersede all pre-existing frameworks and methods for dealing with fuzziness. Additionally, this research investigates the application of interval-valued complex spherical fuzzy relations to assess the impact of various communication network security measures and the threats encountered by these networks. We further examine the positive, neutral, and negative effects of one factor on the other factors in the proposed applications, denoted by the membership grade, abstinence grade, and non-membership grade, respectively. Finally, we examine the proposed method to reveal its advantages and superiority to the current approaches.

DE Core features; Dual-attention mechanism; Information propagation; Graph
   neural network; Personalized recommendation
AB As a popular graph learning technique, graph neural networks (GNN) show great advantages in the field of personalized recommendation. Existing GNN-based recommendation methods organized user-item interactions (e.g., click, purchase, review, etc.) as the bipartite graph and captured the higher-order collaborative signal with the aid of the GNN to achieve personalized recommendation. However, there exists two limitations in existing studies. First, core features activating user-item interactions were not be identified, which causes that user-item interactions fail to be accurately exploited at the feature level. Second, existing GNNs ignored the mutual association among neighbors in information propagation, which results in structural signal in the bipartite graph not being sufficiently captured. Towards this end, we developed the core features activated graph dual-attention network, namely C-GDN, for personalized recommendation. Specifically, C-GDN firstly identifies core user and item features activating user-item interactions and employs these core features to initialize the bipartite graph, which effectively optimizes the utilizing of user-item interactions at the feature level. Furthermore, C-GDN designs a novel graph dual-attention network to conduct information propagation, which captures more sufficient structural signal in the bipartite graph by considering information from neighbors as well as their mutual association. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets shows that C-GDN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TI Dynamic feature splicing for few-shot rare disease diagnosis

DT Article
DE Few-shot learning; Rare diseases diagnosis; Transformer; Feature
   splicing; Channel similarity
AB Annotated images for rare disease diagnosis are extremely hard to collect. Therefore, identifying rare diseases under a few-shot learning (FSL) setting is significant. Existing FSL methods transfer useful and global knowledge from base classes with abundant training samples to enrich features of novel classes with few training samples, but still face difficulties when being applied to medical images due to the complex lesion characteristics and large intra-class variance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic feature splicing (DNFS) framework for few-shot rare disease diagnosis. Under DNFS, both low-level features (i.e., the output of three convolutional blocks) and high-level features (i.e., the output of the last fully connected layer) of novel classes are dynamically enriched. We construct the position coherent DNFS (P-DNFS) module to perform low-level feature splicing, where a lesion-oriented Transformer is designed to detect lesion regions. Thus, novel-class channels are replaced by similar base-class channels within the detected lesion regions to achieve diseaser-elated feature enrichment. We also devise a semantic coherent DNFS (S-DNFS) module to perform high-level feature splicing. It explores cross-image channel relations and selects base-class channels with semantic consistency for explicit knowledge transfer. Both low-level and high-level feature splicings are performed dynamically and iteratively. Consequently, abundant spliced features are generated for disease diagnosis, leading to more accurate decision boundary and improved diagnosis performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three medical image classification datasets. Our results suggest that the proposed DNFS achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

AB 3D point clouds are discrete samples of continuous surfaces which can be used for various applications. However, the lack of true connectivity information, i.e., edge information, makes point cloud recognition challenging. Recent edge-aware methods incorporate edge modeling into network designs to better describe local structures. Although these methods show that incorporating edge information is beneficial, how edge information helps remains unclear, making it difficult for users to analyze its usefulness. To shed light on this issue, in this study, we propose a new algorithm called Diffusion Unit (DU) that handles edge information in a principled and interpretable manner while providing decent improvement. First, we theoretically show that DU learns to perform task-beneficial edge enhancement and suppression. Second, we experimentally observe and verify the edge enhancement and suppression behavior. Third, we empirically demonstrate that this behavior contributes to performance improvement. Extensive experiments and analyses performed on challenging benchmarks verify the effectiveness of DU. Specifically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in object part segmentation using ShapeNet part and scene segmentation using S3DIS.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Recently, domain adaptation methods are widely applied to intelligent failure prediction to solve the problem of lack of labeled data for newly designed equipment. Generally, domain adaptation assumes that the target to be predicted is consistent with the label space of the source domain. However, a more practical scenario may be that the distribution of the source domain is a subset of the target's since the new types of equipment may have different failure characteristics. Learning from a single source domain is insufficient to support the prediction task on the target domain. Multiple-source domain adaptation becomes a desperately needed solution. To this end, this paper proposes a locally weighted multi-domain collaborative adaptation method (LWMDCA). A locally weighted technique is introduced to construct the multi-source collaborative joint domain based on the similarity weighted regular coefficient to provide complete diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, to further utilize the knowledge, a new feature extractor based on multi-instance learning with attention mechanism is designed to focus on the important failure characteristics. Finally, comparative analysis with many state-of-the-art failure prediction methods using Alibaba's SSDs datasets is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The high-dimensional datasets in various domains, such as text categorization, information retrieval and bioinformatics, have highlighted the importance of feature selection in data mining. Despite the numerous existing approaches to feature selection, there is still a need for further research in this field. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary filter feature selection approach that can be used for both single-and multi-objective scenarios by introducing an objective function inspired by Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA)-based method and then integrating it into the differential evolution framework. The proposed approach applicable to two scenarios aims to identify an optimal feature subset through an evolutionary search process that maximizes class separation while minimizing the dimensionality. Through comprehensive experimental studies conducted on diverse datasets, the results show that the proposed approach outperforms recently proposed evolutionary information-theoretic, rough set-based and state-of-the-art feature selection approaches in both scenarios. Notably, this study is the first to integrate an NCA-based strategy into an evolutionary feature selection approach. Furthermore, you can access the source code of this approach at https://github.com/ ehancer06/DENCA this link.

   Diffusion model
AB Accurate prediction of the future motion of surrounding vehicles is crucial for ensuring the safety of motion planning in autonomous vehicles. However, it is challenging to perform because of the complex interactions between vehicles. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal vehicle trajectory prediction framework that utilizes a coarse-to-fine approach by first generating initial trajectory proposals with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and then refining them using the conditional diffusion model. We first address the problems of data sparsity and irregularity by converting the trajectory coordinates to the Frenet coordinate system. To enable the model to better distinguish between different features, we employ a temporal encoder to extract trajectory features and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract lane features. The target lane evaluator is utilized to calculate the attention weights for each lane candidate, thereby generating more deterministic future trajectories. We then use the CVAE to generate initial multiple trajectory proposals based on the surrounding scene context and the trajectory features of the target vehicle. Finally, we formulate the trajectory refinement task as a reverse process of the conditional diffusion model, which effectively enhances the multi-modal trajectory proposals. Experiments conducted on Argoverse and nuScenes demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in some evaluation metrics while achieving the optimal trade-off between predictive accuracy and efficiency. Field experiments conducted in urban environments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is used to detect corresponding sentiment polarities toward different aspect terms. In recent years, graph convolutional network-based methods achieve great success for ABSA. However, previous studies ignore syntactic dependency types and aspect-related syntactic distances. Besides, effectively fusing semantic and syntactic information remains a challeng-ing problem. Previous studies also neglect interactions between aspect terms and context. To alleviate the above problems, we develop a Multi-Information Fusion and Interaction Neural Network (MIFINN), which consists of an Aspect and Syntax-Aware Multi-Information Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (ASAMIFGCN) and a Multi-Information Interaction and Gating Network (MIIGN). The ASAMIFGCN model can integrate and fuse contextual semantics, syntactic dependency types, and aspect-related syntactic distances. Specifically, two different attentions are designed to learn global and aspect-related semantic and syntactic information, respectively. A syntactic distance gating module is proposed to acquire more precise score matrices. Besides, we propose a semantic and syntactic association module to fuse multi-information simultaneously. The MIIGN model can effectively interact aspect terms and context. Specifically, two interactive attentions are developed to learn different weights toward aspect terms and context via interactions between each other, respectively.

AB Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to automatically identify unexpected spatial-temporal patterns to detect abnormal events in surveillance videos. Existing unsupervised VAD methods either use a single proxy task to represent the prototypical normal patterns, or split the video into static and dynamic parts and learn spatial and temporal normality separately, which cannot model the inherent uncertainty of motion. In this regard, we propose for the first time to learn video normality via stochastic motion representation. Specifically, the proposed Stochastic Video Normality (SVN) network learns the prototypical local appearance patterns via deterministic multi-task learning and global motion patterns in a non-deterministic manner. The stochastic representation module uses recurrent networks to model historical motion as a conditional Gaussian distribution and infers motion explicitly with the learned prior. Besides, a mask auto-encoder is introduced to explore the relationship between appearance and motion, boosting the model to learn spatial-temporal normality. Experimental results show that our proposed SVN network performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-task learning-based appearance representation and stochastic motion representation for unsupervised video anomaly detection.

AB Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are commonly used by cardiologists to detect heart-related pathological conditions. Reliable collections of ECGs are crucial for precise diagnosis. However, in clinical practice, the assignment of captured ECG recordings to incorrect patients can occur inadvertently. In collaboration with a clinical and research facility which recognized this challenge and reached out to us, we present a study that addresses this issue. In this work, we propose a small and efficient neural-network based model for determining whether two ECGs originate from the same patient. Our model demonstrates great generalization capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance in gallery-probe patient identification on PTB-XL while utilizing 760x fewer parameters. Furthermore, we present a technique leveraging our model for detection of recording -assignment mistakes, showcasing its applicability in a realistic scenario. Finally, we evaluate our model on a newly collected ECG dataset specifically curated for this study, and make it public for the research community.

AB Synthetic data generation for tabular data unlike computer vision, is an emerging challenge. When tabular data needs to be synthesized, it either faces a small dataset problem or violates privacy if the data contains sensitive information. When the data is small, any data-driven modeling leads to biased decision making. On the other hand, deep learning models that use small dataset for training are limited. Tabular data also faces a myriad of challenges, such as mixed data types, fidelity, mode collapse, etc. To eradicate small dataset problems and increase the deep learning capabilities on small data, a new generative method, GenerativeMTD, is proposed in this research. The method generates fake data by using pseudo-real data as input during the training. Pseudo-real data serves the purpose of training the deep learning model with large samples when the real dataset size is small. The pseudo-real data is generated from the real data through k-nearest neighbor mega-trend diffusion. This pseudo-real data is then translated into synthetic data that is similar and realistic to the real data. The method outperforms some of the state-of-the-art methodologies that exist in tabular data generation. The proposed method also generates quality synthetic data for the benchmark datasets in terms of pairwise correlation differences. In addition, the method surpasses the benchmark models in terms of the distance-based privacy metrics: distance to the closest record and nearest neighbor distance ratio.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

DE XAI; Post-hoc model explanation; Gaussian mixture model; Deep-learning
   interpretability
AB Explainable AI (XAI) promotes understandability and credibility in the complex decision-making process of machine learning models. Post-hoc explanations for deep neural networks are crucial because they focus on faithful explanation of the learned representations, decision mechanisms, and uncertainty of the model. Explaining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) is particularly challenging because of the high dimensionality of deep features and the complexity of model inference. Most post-hoc explanation methods follow one single paradigm of explanation, confining the diversity and consistency of the explanation. This study proposes a joint Gaussian mixture model (JGMM), which is a probabilistic model that jointly models deep inter-layer features and produces faithful and consistent post-hoc explanations. The JGMM explains deep features by Gaussian mixture model and model inference by the posterior distribution of the latent component variables. JGMM enables a versatile explanation framework that unifies the interpretable proxy model and mining global and local explanatory examples. Experiments are performed on various DCNN image classifiers in comparison with other explaining methods. The results show that the JGMM can efficiently produce versatile, consistent, faithful, and understandable explanations.

   Metric learning
AB Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is important for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of relocalization in a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) system, effectively reducing potential errors in mapping and navigation tasks. In VPR tasks, CNN-based VPR techniques encounter challenges in mitigating the impact of severe appearance changes caused by seasons and weather, as well as, viewpoint changes arising from robot motion deviations. To cope with this problem, a local-to-global similarity strategy is proposed in this paper. Specifically, an Auto-Encoder (AE) block is designed to distill appearance-invariant local features from AlexNet, where each local feature represents a specific image patch. Then, three local similarity measures, namely paired similarity, additional similarity, and adjacent similarity, are used to measure the similarity between paired images. Finally, weight encoders are introduced to combine the three local measures into a global one that achieves viewpoint-invariance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is robust to severe appearance and viewpoint changes while outperforming the current state-of-the-art methods on public visual place recognition datasets. Moreover, the proposed similarity strategy distinguishes the relationships between internal and external patches within images, effectively enhancing its recognition capability in real-world scenarios.

ID AIR-TRAFFIC COMPLEXITY
AB Airspace complexity is a paramount safety metric to measure the difficulty and effort required to safely manage air traffic. The continuing growth in air traffic demand results in increasing airspace complexity and unprecedented safety concerns. Most existing methods treat the minimization of airspace complexity as the sole objective, ignoring the path deviation cost induced by the re-scheduled aircraft. In this paper, regarding reduction of airspace complexity and path deviation cost as two conflicting objectives, a multi-objective airspace complexity mitigation model is proposed to simultaneously ensure the safety and efficiency of air transport by optimizing flight trajectories. To effectively solve this multi-objective and non-linear optimization problem, a novel Memetic Algorithm with Adaptive Local Search (called MA-ALS) is developed. Specifically, we design a new crossover and three new local search operators under the flight trajectory representation. MA-ALS conducts exploration by crossover, and exploitation by a hill-climbing local search process. Moreover, we proposed an adaptive local search selection mechanism which facilitates the dynamic collaboration of different local search operators during evolution. A comprehensive comparison with the most recently developed algorithms on Chinese air traffic dataset is conducted. The Pareto front generated by the proposed algorithm dominates that of the compared baselines. Moreover, compared with a real flight schedule, the flight plan obtained by the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the airspace complexity.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for effective and non-intrusive methods to monitor the well-being of elderly individuals in their homes, especially for early detection of potential viral infections. Conspicuously, the present paper develops a Multi-scaled Long Short Term Memory (Ms-LSTM) model for the routine health monitoring of elderly patients to detect COVID-19. The proposed method offers home-based health diagnostics through urine analysis by leveraging the IoT-Fog-Cloud paradigm. Mainly, the proposed model constitutes a four-layered architecture: data acquisition, fog layer, cloud layer, and interface layer. Each layer serves distinct functionalities and provides specific services, thereby collectively enhancing the overall effectiveness of the model. The statistical results of the study demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Ms-LSTM model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and LSTM. Further, the proposed model attains a mean temporal efficiency of 39.23 seconds. It exhibits high reliability (92.97%), stability (70.06%), and predictive accuracy (93.25%).

AB Marginal rates of technical changes and marginal impact are useful tools to calculate the trade-offs between production factors in a production process. In the data envelopment analysis (DEA) framework, the calculation of these trade-offs (marginal rates of technical substitution, marginal rates of transformation, marginal productivity and marginal costs) using the existing deterministic approaches may be sensitive to uncertainty and variability of the input and output data. Therefore, in this contribution, we introduce a stochastic DEA model based on chance constrained programming to develop a measure of the marginal rates of firms facing data uncertainty. In this contribution, chance-constrained programming is used to develop a procedure to calculate these trade-offs. Our proposed stochastic procedure is applied to sample data on 31 power plants. The empirical results on marginal rates obtained from our proposed stochastic programs revealed that the results are different at various tolerance levels of chance constraints.

TI Stock price momentum modeling using social media data

AB Alternative data has rapidly gained popularity as a means of observing investor reactions to current stock market events, analyzing sector movements, and developing investment strategies. Signals observed from alternative data may add valuable information to conventional market analysis, especially when there exists some infor-mation asymmetry in the market, to which small-cap stocks are particularly sensitive. Our research uses alter-native textual data obtained from social media to predict the price momentum of small-cap stocks, which are known to be sensitive to market events and retail investors' reactions. We directly address the challenges in the analysis of texts, especially in the Korean language, such as the use of jargon, acronyms, and typos, by taking a two-fold approach to preprocessing. Then, we extract the social keywords and label them by two standards: word momentum and correlation with stock price movement. Using these social keywords as social indicators derived from the retail investors trading small-cap stocks, in addition to the conventional technical indicators, we pro-pose a price momentum forecast model which classifies whether the closing price of a given small-cap stock will increase by more than 10% in the next 5 business days. Experimental results show that our approach successfully extracts social keywords that play a significant role in determining the price momentum in the market, and our selected social indicators are intuitive to human understanding. Furthermore, we consider example investment scenarios and run tests by training various classifiers with the social indicators and computing cumulative returns. Our results are very promising and show that the investment scenarios with social indicators outperform the benchmark considerably. We anticipate that our work will expand the scope of using alternative data for stock market analysis and price momentum forecasts by incorporating social indicators extracted from social media.

AB Carbonation depth involves complex physical process and interactions of multiple variables and is thus extremely complicated to predict in concrete structures. It is imperative to quantify this depth due to its vital role in the corrosion of rebars in recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). This paper developed a novel carbonation depth prediction model from a large database of 445 experimental results using artificial neural network (ANN). The relative importance and effect of the independent parameters in the carbonation depth are identified using Garson index and parametric analysis, respectively. Among all the architectures considered, the N 8-10-1 having 10 nodes in the hidden layer provided the best prediction in good agreement with experimental results. The model demonstrated superior performance relative to existing carbonation depth equations in the literature. Despite the presence of fuzziness in the data, the effect of each variable in the development of carbonation is explored in great detail. The model proposed here can provide a robust prediction of carbonation depth that can be used as a basis for assessing the structural health of recycled aggregate concrete structures.

AB The container relocation problem (CRP) is a combinatorial optimisation problem in which the sequence of container relocations must be determined to retrieve all containers from the yard while optimising a given objective. Prior to now, the primary objective of CRP was to minimise the number of container relocations; however, due to environmental concerns, optimising energy consumption is gaining importance. This criterion was not considered extensively in the literature about CRP; therefore, there is a lack of suitable methods to tackle this problem variant. Primarily, there is a lack of relocation rules (RRs), simple heuristics that efficiently solve large problems in negligible time. Unfortunately, RRs are challenging to design manually since this process requires significant domain knowledge and is time-consuming. Using hyperheuristics to evolve new RRs automatically is one way to circumvent this problem. In this study, we evolved new RRs that aim to minimise energy consumption using genetic programming. We consider both the scenario in which only energy consumption is optimised and a multi-objective scenario where energy consumption is optimised together with the number of container relocations. The proposed approach is compared with an existing approach from the literature that uses a genetic algorithm to design RRs. The results show that RRs designed using genetic programming perform significantly better than the existing method, especially in multi-objective scenarios.

AB Outlier detection is extensively adopted in machine learning applications to identify rare but significant objects in a data distribution that deviate from the majority of objects. However, none of the existing outlier definitions use the available contextual label information in a dataset to improve the identification of outliers, though it could improve the performance of data analysis. In this study, we propose a novel definition for outliers considering the available contextual label information along with a method to remove outliers based on the proposed definition to improve classification performance and granulation purity. The experimental results on eight public datasets show that the removal of outliers using the novel method highly improves the classification accuracy with Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Classification and Regression Tree algorithms while identifying 100% pure subclasses of the labeled major classes. This method is beneficial in identifying the outliers automatically when the data contains classification information about a specific application instead of outlierness information.

AB Today, due to the widespread use of smartphones, numerous applications, and their advantages in a number of daily tasks, subscribers desire a high-speed connection more than ever before. There may be some subscribers who choose to subscribe to more than one telecommunications service provider to satisfy their needs. Operators in such a competitive environment try to take advantage of this diversity of consumer needs and preferences in order to provide different services and pricing options. In this paper, a duopoly market consisting of two mobile operators is examined from a game theory perspective. By offering and pricing various bundled call and data services, as complementary services, operators try to maximize their profits. Subscribers choose the bundle with the highest surplus that best suits their telecom needs. Subscribers from various market segments may churn if they discover that other operators offer service plans with higher surpluses. The problem is formulated as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) where operators price service plans simultaneously while they are coupled through shared constraints. After reformulating the mathematical model, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to find an equilibrium solution. In addition to extensive numerical experiments, a thorough sensitivity analysis is conducted. Finally, this study provides some managerial insights that may assist telecom operators in making optimal decisions regarding the pricing and design of their bundles in a competitive environment.

AB With the extensive application of laser cutting, the proper planning of the cutting path has a significate impact on industrial production, like clothing, metalware, and furniture. This paper proposes heuristic approaches for the two-dimensional cutting path problem, which aims to find the shortest path to cut pieces from the master plate. Two cutting methods, the arc routing method, and the node routing method, are studied based on whether the piece must be cut separately. A two-step heuristic approach is proposed for the arc routing method. A model based on a generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP) and a variable neighborhood search (VNS) is introduced for the node routing method. The results show that the proposed two-step heuristic quickly finds the optimal or near-optimal solution. CPLEX using the GTSP model can solve small-size instances, while the VNS can find the solution with good quality in a reasonable time for medium-size instances. In addition, the model and approaches are also tested on larger instances with more than 250 pieces and 20,000 nodes. The results show that the proposed heuristics can handle these instances within a reasonable time.

DE Dual -level Transformer; Fine-grained supervision; Place recognition;
   Transformer-guided geometric verification
ID FEATURES; LOCALIZATION
AB Visual place recognition is a fundamental component in autonomous systems and robotics, which is easily limited in the real world with different viewpoints and changes in appearance. Existing approaches to tackle this problem mainly rely on dominant CNN-based architectures, which are difficult to model global correlation. Most recently, there has emerged little work that focuses on the effectiveness of the Transformer in modeling long-range dependencies, but this strategy ignores local interactions thus fails to localize the really important regions. To address the above issue, this paper proposes an effective Transformer-based architecture that takes full advantages of the strengths of Transformer related to global context modeling and local specific region capturing. We first design a dual-level Transformer descriptor encoder to successively perform self-attention within local windows and global extent of the CNN feature map to obtain multi-scale spatial context, which combines local interaction and global information. Specifically, multi-layer classification tokens from the Transformer encoder are integrated to form the global image representation. Moreover, a Transformer-guided geometric verification module is introduced to leverage the strengths of the hierarchical Transformer's inherent self-attention mechanism for fusing multi-level attention, which is employed to filter the output token to obtain key patches and associated attention weights for achieving spatial matching. Finally, we propose a descriptor refinement strategy that employs fine-grained region-level supervisions to further enhance the capability of the network to learn local discriminative features, which effectively alleviates the confusion caused from weak image-level labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with promising performance. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is one powerful tool for varied control automation problems. Performances of DRL highly depend on the accuracy of value estimation for states from environments. However, the Value Estimation Network (VEN) in DRL can be easily influenced by the phenomenon of catastrophic interference from environments and training. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Sparse Coding-based (DSC) VEN model to obtain precise sparse representations for accurate value prediction and sparse parameters for efficient training, which is not only applicable in Q-learning structured discrete-action DRL but also in actor-critic structured continuous-action DRL. In detail, to alleviate interference in VEN, we propose to employ DSC to learn sparse representations for accurate value estimation with dynamic gradients beyond the conventional l1 norm that provides same-value gradients. To avoid influences from redundant parameters, we employ DSC to prune weights with dynamic thresholds more efficiently than static thresholds like l1 norm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms with dynamic sparse coding can obtain higher control performances than existing benchmark DRL algorithms in both discrete-action and continuous-action environments, e.g., over 25% increase in Puddle World and about 10% increase in Hopper. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can reach convergence efficiently with fewer episodes in different environments.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Storytelling and narrative are fundamental to human experience, intertwined with our social and cultural engagement. As such, researchers have long attempted to create systems that can generate stories automatically. In recent years, powered by deep learning and massive data resources, automatic story generation has shown significant advances. However, considerable challenges, like the need for global coherence in generated stories, still hamper generative models from reaching the same storytelling ability as human narrators. To tackle these challenges, many studies seek to inject structured knowledge into the generation process, which is referred to as structured knowledge-enhanced story generation. Incorporating external knowledge can enhance the logical coherence among story events, achieve better knowledge grounding, and alleviate over-generalization and repetition problems in stories. This survey provides the latest and comprehensive review of this research field: (i) we present a systematic taxonomy regarding how existing methods integrate structured knowledge into story generation; (ii) we summarize involved story corpora, structured knowledge datasets, and evaluation metrics; (iii) we give multidimensional insights into the challenges of knowledge-enhanced story generation and cast light on promising directions for future study.

AB Traffic data exhibit the spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Revealing traffic system correlations (TSC) from traffic data, which refers to discovering inter-station correlations incurred from movements of passengers, is a meaningful task for releasing traffic congestion and sustainable urban operations. Since traffic data involve a great loss or corruption due to equipment and transmission failures, traffic data completion (TDC) serves as a necessary task for TSC exploration. We observe that: for the TDC task, traffic data exhibit anisotropic periodicity and repetition along different temporal dimensions, which cannot be captured by traditional low -rank TDC methods; for the TSC exploration task, a traffic network obeys graphical structure and exhibits a strong spatial correlation between stations or road segments. Based on these observations, we propose a Tensorial Weighted Schatten-p Norm model with Neighbor Regularization (TWSN2R) for accomplishing the two tasks simultaneously. TWSN2R consists of a tensorial weighted Schatten-p norm term and a neighbor regularization term. The first term mines the anisotropic periodicity with a tensor form of weighted Schatten-p norm which preserves suitable rank components of traffic data by allocating different weights in both tensorial dimension and decomposed mode dimension. The second term mines a spatial correlation of a traffic network by enforcing a neighbor contribution of passenger flows incurred from the network, and extrinsically reveals an inter-station (or inter-road-segment) TSC of the network. Experiments on the subway flow dataset MetroBJ and the road network vehicle speed dataset RoadBJ demonstrate that, TWSN2R not only outperforms several state-of-the-art TDC methods, but also reveals two pieces of regulations of TSC. (a) For subway passenger flows, positive correlated stations and negative correlated stations contribute to passenger flows differently according to each station's attributes. (b) For road networks, urban loops, expressways and transportation hubs contribute to the vehicle flows at a majority, and serve as the critical roads for mitigating the congestion of whole road networks.

TI Structure-preserving feature alignment for old photo colorization
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION

DT Article
DE Old photo colorization; Structure preservation; Feature alignment;
   Hierarchical training
AB Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However, directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by qualitative and quantitative metrics.

ID OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY; SURFACE; ROBUST
AB In current Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)-based fingerprint recognition systems, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction are treated as two independent branches, resulting in high computation and system building complexity. Therefore, this paper proposes a uniform representation model for simultaneous PAD and subsurface fingerprint reconstruction. A novel semantic segmentation network using attention mechanisms was designed to extract and segment multiple subsurface structures from real finger slices (i.e., B-scans). The latent codes derived from the network are directly used to effectively detect PA because they contain abundant subsurface biological information, which is independent of PA materials and has strong robustness for unknown PAs. Segmented subsurface structures were adopted to reconstruct multiple subsurface 2D fingerprints. Extensive experiments were carried out on an in-house database, which is the largest public OCT-based fingerprint database with 2449 volumes. PAD performance was evaluated by comparing the results of the existing methods with those of other segmentation networks. The proposed uniform representation model can obtain an accuracy (Acc) of 96.63%, which achieves a state-of-the -art performance. The effectiveness of subsurface reconstruction was evaluated from the segmentation and recognition results. In the segmentation experiments, the proposed method achieved the best results with an Intersection of Union (mIOU) of 0.834 and a Pixel Accuracy of 0.937. By comparing the recognition performance on surface 2D fingerprints (e.g., commercial and high-resolution), the lowest results with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.25% by minutiae matching and an EER of 5.42% by pore matching are achieved, which indicates the excellent reconstruction capability of the proposed uniform representation model.

AB As one of the most popular machine learning methods, random forests have been successfully applied to different data analysis tasks such as classification, regression and cluster analysis. Recently, the random forest clustering method has received much attention due to its simplicity, accuracy and robustness. However, we cannot directly employ the random forest clustering algorithm to solve the discrete sequence clustering problem because of the lack of explicit features and "negative"sequences. In this paper, we propose a new random forest clustering algorithm for discrete sequences. The proposed method firstly injects a set of decoy sequences and then constructs the random forest in a supervised and adaptive manner by generating features on the fly. Experimental results on real data sets show that the proposed method can achieve better performance than those state-of-the-art discrete sequence clustering algorithms.

AB Self-driving vehicles and autonomous ground robots require a reliable and accurate method to analyze the traversability of the surrounding environment for safe navigation. This paper proposes and evaluates a real-time machine learning-based traversability analysis method that combines geometric features with a pyramid-polar space representation based on SVM classifiers. In particular, we show that by fusing geometric features with information stemming from coarser pyramid levels that account for a broader space portion, as well as integrating important implementation details, allows for a noticeable boost in performance and reliability. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate that traversability analysis is possible with effective results and in real-time even on cheaper hardware than expensive GPUs, e.g. CPU-only PCs. The proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches on publicly available datasets of outdoor driving scenarios, running such algorithms both on GPU and CPU to compare runtimes. Our method can be fully executed on CPU and achieves results close to the best-in-class methods, runs faster, and requires fewer and less expensive hardware resources, consuming less than 30% electrical power with respect to deep learning models on embedded processing units. We release with this paper the open-source implementation of our method.

Compared to the state-of-the-art PLASTIC algorithms, our results in four different domains from the multi-agent systems literature show that TEAMSTER is more flexible than the PLASTIC-Model, by learning the environment's model instead of assuming a perfect hand-coded model, and more robust/efficient than PLASTIC-Policy, by being able to continuously adapt to newly encountered teams, without implicitly learning a new environment model from scratch.

AB This paper focuses on predicting the length of stay for patients on the first day of admission and propose a predictive model named DGLoS. In order to capture the influence of various complex factors on the length of stay as well as the dependencies among various factors, DGLoS uses a deep neural network to model both the patient information and diagnostic information. Targeting at different attribution types, we utilize different coding methods to convert raw data to the input features. Besides, we find that similar patients have closer lengths of stay. Therefore, we further design a module based on graph representation learning to generate patients' similarity-aware representations, capturing the similarity between patients and therefore enhancing predictions. These similarity-aware representations are incorporated into the output of the deep neural network to jointly perform the prediction. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on a real world hospitalization dataset. The performance comparison shows that our proposed DGLoS model improves predictive performance and the significance test demonstrates the improvement is significant. The ablation study verifies the effectiveness of each of the proposed components and the hyper-parameter investigation shows the robustness of the proposed model.

AB The most prevalent microbe-caused issues that reduce agricultural output globally are viral and bacterial infections. It is currently quite challenging to identify pathogens due to the current living situation. Biosensors have become the standard for monitoring microbial and viral macromolecules. Disease diagnosis is improved by following the nanoparticles released by infections. Since the sensors' data includes different learning patterns, Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to analyze and interpret it. This research paper aimed to study whether Near-infrared (nIR) and Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) imaging might be used to define and detect Plant Disease (PD) using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Feature Extraction (FE) and Feature Classification (FC). A home-built Single-Walled Carbon NanoTube (SWCNTs) implemented with a Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) aptamer that binds to a Hemi (HeApt + DNA + SWCNT) sensing device was used to analyze near-infrared (nIR) and RGB images of tea plant leaf samples. Three labels are extracted from the nIR + RGB using a Wasserstein Distance (WD)-based Feature Extraction Model (FEM), and then all those labels are loaded into the proposed CNN model to ensure precise classification. The proposed Wasserstein Distance-to-Convolutional Neural Network (WD2CNN) model was compared to different CNN architectures on the same dataset, achieving the highest accuracy of 98.72%. It is also the most computationally efficient, with the shortest average time per epoch. The model demonstrates high performance and efficiency in classifying biosensor images, which could aid in the early detection and prevention of Crop Diseases (CD).(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ID NEAREST NEIGHBORS
AB Partial multi-view clustering (PMVC) is a hot topic in data mining, where each view suffers from the absence of some data. Although many PMVC algorithms have been presented with appropriate performance, to the best of our knowledge, almost all of them need to be fed with the number of clusters as hyperparameters. Moreover, these existing algorithms only create hard partitions for objects with multiple views, which are often in highly overlapping areas. This ignores ambiguity and uncertainty in object assignment, which likely leads to performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose a novel self-filling evidential clustering algorithm (SFPMEC) for the PMVC problem. Based on the shared coefficient matrix learned from a self-filling process, SFPMEC provides a human-readable chart through which the number of clusters can be easily detected. SFPMEC then derives a credal partition under the framework of evidence theory, improving the fault tolerance of clustering and gaining deeper insight into the data structure. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of adopting the self-filling process and evidence theory. Besides, our algorithm shows better performance than other state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets1.

ID IMAGE REGISTRATION; FRAMEWORK
AB It is essential to guarantee product quality by detecting defects in industrial printed labels. Defect detection based on reference comparison is a common method to achieve this task. However, this method yields poor performance under large deformations of printed labels, due to the lack of accurate registration ability between testing images and reference images. Therefore, it is an urgent task to achieve accurate image registration for printed label defect detection. In this paper, a coarse-to-fine end-to-end registration network, named APPR-Net, is proposed to deal with the large deformation. First, we adopt a strategy of image patch splitting and stitching to improve the scalability of image resolution. Second, we design a four-stream affine transformation module followed by a multi-scale pyramid registration network, where a coarse registration is obtained by the former module and then gradually refined by the later network in a coarse-to-fine manner. Third, we introduce a distortion loss function to constrain the text distortion of the warped image after image registration. Finally, to simulate printed labels with defects and large deformation, we build a synthetic database based on real-world industrial printed labels for performance comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed APPR-Net significantly outperforms other compared methods.

AB Automatic segmentation of medical images plays an important role in the diagnosis of diseases. On single modal data, convolutional neural networks have demonstrated satisfactory performance. However, multi-modal data encompasses a greater amount of information rather than single-modal data. Multi-modal data can be effectively used to improve the segmentation accuracy of regions of interest by analyzing both spatial and temporal information. In this study, we propose a dual-path segmentation model for multi-modal medical images, named TranSiam. Taking into account that there is a significant diversity between the different modalities, TranSiam employs two parallel CNNs to extract the features which are specific to each of the modalities. In our method, two parallel CNNs extract detailed and local information in the low-level layer, and the Transformer layer extracts global information in the high-level layer. Finally, we fuse the features of different modalities via a locality-aware aggregation block (LAA block) to establish the association between different modal features. The LAA block is used to locate the region of interest and suppress the influence of invalid regions on multi-modal feature fusion. TranSiam uses LAA blocks at each layer of the encoder in order to fully fuse multi-modal information at different scales. Extensive experiments on several multi-modal datasets have shown that TranSiam achieves satisfying results.

ID NETWORK; IMAGES
AB In the field of medical image analysis, accurate lesion segmentation is beneficial for the subsequent clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Currently, various deep learning-based methods have been proposed to deal with the segmentation task. Albeit achieving some promising performances, the fully-supervised learning approaches require pixel-level annotations for model training, which is tedious and time-consuming for experienced radiologists to collect. In this paper, we propose a weakly semi-supervised segmentation framework, called Point Segmentation Transformer (Point SEGTR). Particularly, the framework utilizes a small amount of fully-supervised data with pixel-level segmentation masks and a large amount of weakly-supervised data with point-level annotations (i.e., annotating a point inside each object) for network training, which largely reduces the demand of pixel-level annotations significantly. To fully exploit the pixel-level and point -level annotations, we propose two regularization terms, i.e., multi-point consistency and symmetric consistency, to boost the quality of pseudo labels, which are then adopted to train a student model for inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on three endoscopy datasets with different lesion structures and several body sites (e.g., colorectal and nasopharynx). Comprehensive experimental results finely substantiate the effectiveness and the generality of our proposed method, as well as its potential to loosen the requirements of pixel-level annotations, which is valuable for clinical applications.

DE Contrastive learning; Sampling strategy; Self-supervised pretraining
AB Contrastive learning methods aim to learn shared representations by minimizing distances between positive pairs, and maximizing distances between negative pairs in the embedding space. To achieve better performance of contrastive learning, one of the key problems is to design appropriate sample pairs. In most previous works, random cropping on the input image is utilized to obtain two views as positive pairs. However, such strategies lead to suboptimal performance since the sampled crops may have inconsistent semantic information, which consequently degrades the quality of contrastive views. To address this limitation, we explore to replenish sample views with better consistency of the image and propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework RepCo. Instead of searching for semantically consistent patches between two different views, we select patches on the same image as the replenishment of positive/negative pairs, encourage patches that are similar but come from different positions as positive pairs, and force patches that are dissimilar but come from adjacent positions to have different representations, i.e. construct negative pairs to enrich the learned representations. Our method effectively generates high-quality contrastive views, explores the untapped semantic consistency on images, and provides more informative representations for downstream tasks. Experiments on adequate downstream tasks have shown that, our approach achieves +2.1 AP50 (COCO pre-trained) and +1.6 AP50 (ImageNet pre-trained) gains on Pascal VOC object detection, +2.3 mIoU gains on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, respectively.

AB Amidst the ongoing higher education reforms in China, the escalated investments in colleges and universities underscore the need for an effective assessment of their performance to ensure sustainable development. However, traditional evaluation methods have proven time-consuming and labor-intensive. In response, a novel approach called CS-RBM (Crow Search Restricted Boltzmann Machine) prediction algorithm has been proposed for the educational management of these institutions. By integrating the CS algorithm and an enhanced RBM algorithm, this method facilitates the scoring of project performance indicators, bolstered by insights from user evaluation form reports. The comprehensive project performance is ultimately derived from this combination. Comparative analysis with the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm on public data sets demonstrates a remarkable 45.6% reduction in prediction errors and an impressive 34.7% increase in iteration speed using the CS-RBM algorithm. The accuracy of the tested data set surpasses 98%, validating the efficacy of the CS-RBM algorithm in achieving precise predictions and effective assessments.

AB Using intelligent agriculture is an important way for the industry to achieve high quality development. To improve the accuracy of the identification of crop diseases under conditions of limited computing resources, such as in mobile and edge computing, we propose an improved lightweight MobileNetV2 crop disease identification model. In this study, MobileNetV2 is used as the backbone network for the application of an improved Bottleneck structure. First, the number of operation channels is reduced using point-by-point convolution, the number of parameters of the model is reduced, and the re-parameterized multilayer perceptron (RepMLP) module is introduced; the latter can capture long-distance dependencies between features and obtain local a priori information to enhance the global perception of the model. Second, the efficient channel-attention mechanism is added to adjust the image-feature channel weights so as to improve the recognition accuracy of the model, and the Hardswish activation function is introduced instead of the ReLU6 activation function to further improve performance. The final experimental results show that the improved MobilNetV2 model achieves 99.53% accuracy in the PlantVillage crop disease dataset, which is 0.3% higher than the original model, and the number of covariates is only 0.9M, which is 59% less than the original model. Also, the inference speed is improved by 8.5% over the original model. The crop disease identification method proposed in this article provides a reference for deployment and application on edge and mobile devices.

AB Music emotion representation learning forms the foundation of user emotion recognition, addressing the challenges posed by the vast volume of digital music data and the scarcity of emotion annotation data. This article introduces a novel music emotion representation model, leveraging the nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (NMF) to derive emotional embeddings of music by utilizing user-generated listening lists and emotional labels. This approach facilitates emotion recognition by positioning music within the emotional space. Furthermore, a dedicated music emotion recognition algorithm is formulated, alongside the proposal of a user emotion recognition model, which employs similarity-weighted calculations to obtain user emotion representations. Experimental findings demonstrate the method's convergence after a mere 400 iterations, yielding a remarkable 47.62% increase in F1 value across all emotion classes. In practical testing scenarios, the comprehensive accuracy rate of user emotion recognition attains an impressive 52.7%, effectively discerning emotions within seven emotion categories and accurately identifying users' emotional states.

AB The capability of the Automatic Identification System (AIS) to provide real-time worldwide coverage of ship tracks has made it possible for maritime authorities to utilize AIS as a means of surveillance to identify anomalies. Anomaly detection in maritime traffic is crucial as anomalous behavior may be a sign of either emergencies or illegal activities. Anomalous ships are recognized based on their behavior by manual examination. Such work requires extensive effort, especially for nationwide surveillance. To deal with this, researchers proposed computational methods to analyze vessel behavior. However, most approaches are region-dependent and require a profile of normality to detect anomalies, and amongst the six types of anomaly, loitering is the least explored. Loitering is not necessarily anomalous behavior as it is common for certain types of ships, such as pilot boats and research vessels. However, tankers and cargo ships normally do not engage in loitering. Based on 12-month manually examined data, nearly 60% of the identified anomalies were loitering, particularly for those of types cargo and tanker. Although manual identification is inefficient, automatically identifying abnormal vessels by merely implementing computing algorithms is not yet feasible. It still needs subject matter experts' assessments. This study proposes a region-independent method to automatically detect loitering without training normal instances and produces a ranked list of loitering vessels to facilitate further anomaly investigation. First, the loitering spatiotemporal characteristics are defined: (1) movement of frequent course change, with a certain speed, within a certain spatial range, (2) movement of frequent course change within traversed geodetic distance, (3) might demonstrate frequent extreme turning, and (4) extreme turning produces a significant discrepancy between the course over ground and the heading of the ship. Then, the characteristics are quantified by manipulating the dynamic information of AIS messages. Finally, the parameters to determine a loitering trajectory are formulated by comparing the rate of course change, speed, and the discrepancy between heading and course with the area of spatial range enclosing the trajectory and the geodetic distance between the start and end point. The loitering score of each trajectory is calculated with the parameters, and the Isolation Forest algorithm is employed to establish a threshold and rank. Then, geographic visualization is created for intuitive evaluation. An experiment was conducted on a real-world dataset covering a sea area of 610,116.37 km2. The results prove the efficacy of the proposed method. It remarkably outperforms the existing approach with 97% accuracy and 92% F-score. The experiment produces a ranked list of loitering vessels and an intuitive visualization in the relevant geographic area. In the realworld scenario, they are practical means to support further examination by human operators.

AB Most previous studies on damage detection in civil engineering structures have focused on either element damage detection or joint damage detection, separately. However, in practice, both elements and joints may be prone to damage, simultaneously. In addition, the development of effective numerical approaches to detect and quantify these damages in real time within structures is essential to ensure their integrity and reliable operation. Therefore, to deal with these problems, this study proposes an effective data-driven approach by using an attention based convolutional gated recurrent unit network (ACGRU) for real time damage detection of combining joint and element in frame structures using incomplete data. In the proposed approach, the convolutional layers in the network are utilized to extract critical features from the raw input data. Then, these extracted features are fed into the gated recurrent unit layers to learn to predict the desired output data. In addition, by introducing the attention mechanisms into the network, the important information can be effectively learned. The performance and applicability of the ACGRU are validated through two different numerical examples using incomplete data in both noise-free condition and noisy condition. Moreover, the effect of the numbers and placements of sensors on the damage detection results is also investigated. The damage detection results achieved by the proposed approach are compared with those of other state-of-the-art methods to inspect the reliability of the proposed approach.

AB Process mining is a research area that enables businesses to analyze and improve their processes by deriving knowledge from event logs. While pinpointing the causes of, for instance, a negative case outcome can provide valuable insights for business users, only a limited amount of research has been done to uncover causal relations within the process mining field while actively distinguishing between correlation and causality. The AITIA-PM algorithm is one of these research projects. This article updates the AITIA-PM method, which uses causality theory to measure cause-and-effect relationships in event logs. The system uses probabilistic temporal logic (PTL) to formulate hypotheses explicitly and then automatically checks them for causality using available data. More precisely, AITIA-PM is designed for process mining since it operates directly on event logs, giving users access to the information stored there, and increasing the scope for meaningful causal analysis in a process mining setting. With this addition, PTL is emphasized more as a crucial algorithmic component, and the method to control for false discovery rates (FDR) is adjusted for increased practical use. The case study shows that after the domain expert provides the search space of hypotheses, the AITIA-PM algorithm can extract valuable cause-effect insights from an event log. The search space can be flexibly defined, making AITIA-PM a powerful tool for business users. An evaluation on artificial data proves AITIA-PM is capable of extracting the causal relationships, while a demonstration on the Road Traffic Fines Management dataset shows the applicability of the algorithm on real data.

AB In this paper, we present an algorithm designed to automatically merge predictions from a collection of individual prediction methods coded in R. The algorithm employs varying weights and decision rules to ascertain the optimal amalgamation of these methods, with the aim of forecasting historical time series data while minimizing human intervention. The algorithm serves as an automated component within the artificial intelligence toolkit.The proposed algorithm (al), denoted as "alPCA" is founded on principal component analysis (PCA), hence the acronym. Commencing with 52 configurations of 11 distinct methods available in R, we calculate several loss functions: specifically, scaled Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) for both fitting (Training Phase) and prediction (Validation Phase), along with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Overall Weighted Average (OWA) solely for prediction (Validation Phase). We then employ PCA to reduce the error matrix derived from this data to one or two dimensions. Subsequently, the methods are ranked based on their proximity to the highest score. A probability distribution is fitted to this proximity metric, and utilizing the percentiles of these values, the optimal methods for combination are selected. We propose three categories of weights derived from the PCA scores, encompassing the fitting sMAPE (Training Phase) and the prediction sMAPE (Validation Phase), to facilitate the amalgamation process. This approach is applied to seven distinct univariate time series across diverse domains, including automobile sales, electricity production, and CO2 levels. Additionally, a set of 100 random monthly series from the M4 competition is included in the analysis. To assess the predictive precision of our algorithm, we compare its performance against three widely utilized combined prediction algorithms available in R. We evaluate the outcomes in Test Phase (unseen data) using four distinct loss functions and conduct a sensitivity analysis to gauge the algorithm's robustness and efficacy across various specifications.

AB The building permitting process is characterized by enormous complexity and multidisciplinarity. It consists of multiple steps, and many involved stakeholders with various responsibilities and personal goals. This, together with the fact that in common practice issuance of a building permit is mostly manual, makes the process long, inefficient and subjective. Digitalization of the building permitting process has been a subject of interest for many researchers. In this work, by implementing a systematic literature review, we map the existing knowledge gaps in the domain that hinder further development and facilitation of technological solutions within the building permitting process. This work demonstrates that the lack of fundamental research and the lack of detailed investigation of each individual sub-process within the entire permitting process, hinder further development of digital or automated solutions for building permitting. Furthermore, we provide a detailed mapping of the subprocesses that building permitting comprises of, as identified in the existing research. As much of the existing research efforts are focused on digitalization and automation aspects, we also provide a clear definition of the different levels of digitalization and automation of the permitting process.

AB This paper presents an efficient computation tool for a multiple-warehouse inventory replenishment lot-sizing problem with supplier selection, quantity discounts, and budget constraint. The cost model of the considered inventory replenishment issue is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. With the proposed MINLP problem being an NP-hard problem, the MINLP cost model was optimized by using a novel global-local neighbor particle swarm optimization algorithm (TPAGLNPSO), inspired by two-phase self-adaptive inertia weight and improved constraint-handling technique. Apart from introducing the velocity index to switch the search scheme from exploration to exploitation, the constraint-handling technique was utilized to guide and guarantee the particle search toward undiscovered regions in the solution space. The stability analysis for the proposed novel TPAGLNPSO was also conducted using the stochastic process theorem. The corresponding parameter selection ranges were obtained based on the convergent conditions. Finally, eight industry cases were provided as examples to evaluate the performance of the proposed TPAGLNPSO method, after which a sensitivity analysis for the MINLP cost model was performed. The results demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed TPAGLNPSO optimizer in terms of solution quality (with near-optimal results) than the optimal solutions obtained from Lingo software and computational effort (CPU time). Such findings can provide practitioners marginal insights into the effective management of the supply chain inventory replenishment problem.

ID COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH
AB This study presents an innovative approach to predict concrete compressive strength using particle packing theories through machine learning techniques. The existing challenge in concrete engineering lies in the accurate estimation of concrete strength, a critical factor in construction. The adoption of particle packing theories, which hold great promise for enhancing concrete performance, has been limited due to the complexity and timeconsuming nature of the required calculations. An approach encompassing particle packing models (JD Dewar Model, Compressible Packing Model, and Modified Toufar Model) with machine learning is the novelty of the work. These models optimize the packing density of aggregate proportions while minimizing the void ratio, essential for achieving desired compressive strength criteria. To train the model, a comprehensive dataset comprising 479 concrete mixtures, each associated with known compressive strength values relative to packing density, is utilized. A significant advancement in predicting concrete compressive strength is demonstrated by the results. The approach outperforms traditional empirical models, offering precise and reliable predictions based on packing density. Importantly, this innovation eliminates the need for time-consuming and costly trialand-error procedures in concrete mix design. The strong performance of various models in predicting concrete strength using particle packing theories is underscored by the study, with R<^>2 values ranging from 0.664 to 0.999. By combining concepts of particle packing theories and machine learning, a more efficient and reliable method for predicting concrete compressive strength is achieved. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize concrete mix design, leading to more durable and cost-effective construction practices.

AB Visual tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision, which extracts the target context descriptions and features from the first image frame and tracks the target in subsequent frames with the updated target appearance models and the updated tracking models accordingly. The existing deficiencies of deep learning based visual tracker are: precision-speed dilemma, inadequate context usage and spawning tracking noises. To achieve real-time and accurate tracking with deep learning modules under tracking-by-detection framework, this paper introduced a discriminative target predictor based on temporal-scene attention context enhancement and candidate matching mechanism (ACDP). The contributions of ACDP include: 1) a vision transformer based temporal context enhancer is suggested by formulating the temporal context enhanced feature extractor via multi-head attention mechanism; 2) a target state propagation scheme based scene context enhancer is proposed via constructing the target state matrix and corresponding state forward propagation techniques; 3) a joint prediction method is provided to take full usage of the enhanced context through candidate selection and matching mechanism based on dust-bin conception network; 4) theoretical proofs for vision transformer acceleration scheme and the error bounds under successive tracking failure circumstances are given. In addition, the extensive experiments under OTB100, UAV123, NFS, AVisT and VOT2018 benchmarks evaluate the favorable performances of ACDP and indicate that: 1) the proposed modules in ACDP can achieve comparable tracking results even under difficult sequences and scenarios against other 21 state-of-the-art trackers; 2) the ACDP performs 35 FPS tracking speed on the 5 benchmarks averagely.

AB The most frequent disease in women and the one that accounts for the majority of cancer-related fatalities in females is breast cancer. An important milestone in breast cancer CAD systems is the automatic recognition and delineation of masses in mammograms. We have developed a novel technique in this study to identify potential mass candidates in mammograms automatically. The suggested method is a pipeline method with three stages. First, a noise reduction method based on median filtering is performed to eliminate the noises. Then, the region of interest is threshold out of the pre-processed images using the Kapur technique. Afterward, to eliminate useless features, optimum feature extraction and selection are designed. It is established by an Improved version of the Chef-Based Optimization (ICBO) algorithm. Lastly, a classification is implemented based on an optimal SqueezeNet model for the final diagnosis. This classifier is also optimized based on the ICBO algorithm to maximize efficiency. Simulations of the method are applied to the MIAS database, and its results are compared with different state-of-the-art methods to show the method's advantage.

AB Recently, more and more studies have begun to use deep learning to decode and classify EEG signals. The use of deep learning has led to an increase in the classification accuracy of motor imagery (MI), but the problem of taking a long time to calibrate in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications has not been solved. To address this problem, we propose a novel Riemannian geometry and deep domain adaptation network (RGDDANet) for MI classification. Specifically, two one-dimensional convolutions are designed to extract temporal and spatial features from the EEG signals, and then the spatial covariance matrices are utilized to map the extracted features to Riemannian manifolds for processing. In order to align the source and target features' distributions on the Riemannian manifold, we propose a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix mean discrepancy loss (SMMDL) to minimize the distance between two domains. To analyze the feasibility of the method, we conducted extensive experiments on BCIC IV 2a and BCIC IV 2b datasets, respectively, and the results showed that the proposed method achieved better performance than some state-of-the-art methods.

AB In emerging economies, sudden stops of capital inflows boost the collapse of stock and exchange rate markets and plunge countries into unemployment, loss of production, and diminishing exports, leading to a financial crisis. Recently, the nonlinear relationship-based machine learning (ML) model for analyzing the complexity and uncertainty of financial and economic systems has been in the spotlight, but they are still poorly used for predicting sudden stops of capital. Because there is no verified tool that elaborately measures the indicia of rapid suspension or expansion of capital for prediction purposes, ML models learned from domains with inadequately defined economic characteristics of capital movements can suffer from poor predictive power and reliability. In addition, many economists do not trust the ML model due to the lack of interpretability caused by the black box structure of ML models. In this study, three approaches are proposed for better prediction and decision-making. First, using data for 37 emerging economies from 1990 to 2019, we apply various ML techniques such as extreme gradient boost (XGB), which is well known for the latest ensemble learning technology. Second, we analyze the causal relationship to the outcomes of our models using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) methods, a powerful technique for ML interpretation. Particularly, from the perspective of post-COVID-19, our model predicts an increased probability of sudden stops in countries where a sharp decline in real interest rates and exports is evident. Finally, we propose a tool to measure capital flows and assess excessive levels for forecasting purposes. Particularly, our tool extracts credit boom events that are highly correlated with sudden stops, and the ML models with credit boom events have significantly improved predictive performance. Specifically, in the forecast of a sudden stop after one year, the prediction accuracy of the models with a credit boom event is improved by 11.2% on average compared to models without credit boom information. In addition, the gap between the predicted hit and the miss rate in the proposed models was reduced to-16.2% on average compared to the original, improving the balance of classification.

DE Speaker embedding Normalization flow Gaussianality training
ID RECOGNITION
AB Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is a critical task in pattern recognition and has been applied to various security-sensitive scenarios. The current state-of-the-art technique for ASV is based on deep embedding. However, a significant challenge with this approach is that the resulting deep speaker vectors tend to be irregularly distributed. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel training method called Maximum Gaussianality (MG), which regulates the distribution of the speaker vectors. Compared to the conventional normalization approach based on maximum likelihood (ML), the new approach directly maximizes the Gaussianality of the latent codes, and therefore can both normalize the between-class and within-class distributions in a controlled and reliable way and eliminate the unbound likelihood problem associated with the conventional ML approach. Our experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our MG-based normalization can deliver much better performance than the baseline systems without normalization and outperform discriminative normalization flow (DNF), an ML-based normalization method, particularly when the training data is limited. In theory, the MG criterion can be applied to any task in any research domain where Gaussian distributions are needed, making the MG training a versatile tool.

DE Image dehazing; Hierarchical contrastive loss; Feature fusion;

AB Image restoration under hazy weather condition, which is called single image dehazing, has been of significant interest for various computer vision applications. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved success. However, existing image dehazing methods typically neglect the hierarchy of features in the neural network and fail to exploit their relationships fully. To this end, we propose an effective image dehazing method named Hierarchical Contrastive Dehazing (HCD), which is based on feature fusion and contrastive learning strategies. HCD consists of a hierarchical dehazing network (HDN) and a novel hierarchical contrastive loss (HCL). Specifically, the core design in the HDN is a hierarchical interaction module, which utilizes multi-scale activation to revise the feature responses hierarchically. To cooperate with the training of HDN, we propose HCL which performs contrastive learning on hierarchically paired exemplars, facilitating haze removal. Extensive experiments on public datasets, RESIDE, HazeRD, and DENSE-HAZE, demonstrate that HCD quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM and achieves better visual quality.

AB Recently, several Vision Transformer (ViT) based methods have been proposed for Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC). These methods significantly surpass existing CNN-based ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of ViT in FGVC tasks. However, there are some limitations when applying ViT directly to FGVC. First, ViT needs to split images into patches and calculate the attention of every pair, which may result in heavy noise calculation during the training phase and unsatisfying performance when handling fine-grained images with complex backgrounds and small objects. Second, complementary information is important for FGVC, but a standard ViT works by using the class token in the final layer for classification which is not enough to extract comprehensive fine-grained information at different levels. Third, the class token fuses the information of all patches in the same manner, in other words, the class token treats each patch equally. However, the discriminative parts should be more critical. To address these issues, we propose ACC-ViT including three novel components, i.e., Attention Patch Combination (APC), Critical Regions Filter (CRF), and Complementary Tokens Integration (CTI). Thereinto, APC pieces informative patches from two images to generate a new image to mitigate the noisy calculation and reinforce the differences between images. CRF emphasizes tokens corresponding to discriminative regions to generate a new class token for subtle feature learning. To extract comprehensive information, CTI integrates complementary information captured by class tokens in different ViT layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four widely used datasets and the results demonstrate that ACC-ViT can achieve competitive performance.

DE Source-free domain adaptation; Class prototype discovery; Pseudo-labels;
   Prototype regularization
AB Source-free domain adaptation requires no access to the source domain training data during unsupervised domain adaption. This is critical for meeting particular data sharing, privacy, and license constraints, whilst raising novel algorithmic challenges. Existing source-free domain adaptation methods rely on either generating pseudo samples/prototypes of source or target domain style, or simply leveraging pseudo-labels (self-training). They suffer from low-quality generated samples/prototypes or noisy pseudo-label target samples. In this work, we address both limitations by introducing a novel Class Prototype Discovery (CPD) method. In contrast to all alternatives, our CPD is established on a set of semantic class prototypes each constructed for representing a specific class. By designing a classification score based prototype learning mechanism, we reformulate the source-free domain adaptation problem to class prototype optimization using all the target domain training data, and without the need for data generation. Then, class prototypes are used to cluster target features to assign them pseudo-labels, which highly complements the conventional self-training strategy. Besides, a prototype regularization is introduced for exploiting well-established distribution alignment based on pseudo labeled target samples and class prototypes. Along with theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks to validate the performance advantages of our CPD over the state-of-the-art models.

AB A data fusion and information integration (DFII-VT) framework is proposed to solve the batch-based vehicle matching/tracking problem using heterogeneous fixed-location and mobile sensing data available in smart cities. To make the model more realistic, traffic knowledge such as lane-choice decision, traffic merging, travel time and vehicle characteristics are calibrated using the historical dataset and then integrated into the model. The problem can be formulated as a combinatorial optimization model, and solved using a dynamic programming/KuhnMunkres algorithm-based two-step approach. By doing so, the proposed method can obtain individual travel times of the matched data pairs, and these can be directly used to estimate the corridor travel times of individual vehicles. The experimental results show that the fusion of mobile sensing data and fixed-location data yields significantly better results than using single-source data. Significant improvements in matching accuracy are obtained as more traffic information is integrated into the model. Therefore, the method may be considered a framework for integrating the manifold traffic information acquired within smart cities to obtain more accurate matching results and further used to optimize other fine-grained traffic applications, such as estimating vehicle trajectories along arterial corridors, estimating individual vehicle-based fuel consumption/emissions, and helping to infer real-time queuing processes at signalized intersections. The paper also studies some practical issues related to the use of heterogeneous traffic data, such as data errors, and detection failures.

AB The cognitive capability of learning from past experiences to resolve relevant tasks at hand is a hallmark of humans. The emerging evolutionary multi-task transfer optimization (EMTO) fashion pursues such intelligent behavior by exploring useful knowledge drawn from solving one task to accelerate the optimization process of other related tasks. However, in practical scenario, knowledge drawn from various task domains may not always benefit the solving process of one another, and source-target domain mismatch is likely to induce notorious negative transfer, which is a critical concern in EMTO. Domain adaption aims to narrow the gap between distinct domains so as to curb negative transfer. Generally, different strategies possess distinct advantages in different situations, no one can dominate others in all cases. Taking this cue, we present a novel bandit-mechanism-based ensemble method to determine the proper domain adaption strategy online in the context of EMTO. Besides, the intensity of cross-task knowledge transfer is adapted according to historical experiences of the population. We carry out extensive experiments to examine the performance of proposed approach, demonstrating its superiority in comparison to state-of-the-art peers in multi-task problem-solving scenario. Our work thus sheds light on a new alternative way for automatic domain adaption for knowledge transfer across problems.

AB The real-time reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is a widely used laboratory technique that is highly sensitive and reliable for measuring the quantification of gene expression levels and diagnosing various of diseases, including COVID-19. The RT-PCR experiments often have correlated technical replicates of a small number of samples. However, current statistical analysis of RT-PCR assumes a large sample size and does not account for correlated structure across the replicates. In this paper, we review popular statistical methods for analyzing RT-PCR data and propose a permutation method that accounts for the small sample size and the correlated structure of RT-PCR data. Our proposed method provides a more accurate and efficient analysis of RT-PCR data. We provide an R program to implement our method for practitioners.

AB Scheduling problem with blocking is an attractive research direction due to its wide practical applications. However, in the distributed hybrid flow shop problem (DHFSP), there are few studies on blocking constraints. In this article, we study a distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with blocking constraints (DBHFSP), where the goal is to minimize the maximum completion time, and propose a tri-individual iterated greedy (TIG) algorithm based on the characteristics of the DBHFSP. First, an active decoding strategy is designed to reduce the idle time of machines. Afterward, a framework of multiple iterative solutions is designed to enhance the diversity of the solutions, in which the multiple solutions are generated through a neighborhood search. Then, a heuristic rule based on blocking constraint is proposed to generate promising initial solutions. In addition, an insertionbased search strategy based on rotating critical factories is designed to accelerate the convergence speed of the TIG algorithm. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms and classical intelligent optimization algorithms. The experimental results show that the TIG algorithm is superior to the comparison algorithm in solving the DBHFSP.

AB In order to develop high-fidelity and high-efficiency machine learning (ML) models in reliability engineering, a novel ML approach based on Neural Networks (NN) with Physics-Informed Training Samples (PITS) is established, which is abbreviated as NN-PITS. The proposed NN-PITS framework uses data augmentation techniques to improve the training samples based on the properties of the failure surface, so that the physical information is embedded into the NN. Two approaches for embedding physical information are introduced. When the limit state equation (LSE) can be solved analytically, the training samples are extended to the failure surface based on the LSE, and then the physics-informed loss function is constructed. When the LSE is implicit or unsolvable analytically, a novel sampling method based on pseudo-probability distribution to generate the samples of required distribution is proposed, so as to obtain the PITS that are near the failure surface. Compared with the common data-driven NN model, the proposed NN-PITS framework can effectively utilize the physical informa-tion in reliability problem, so as to reduce the dependence on label samples. The proposed NN-PITS can be combined with finite element analysis (FEA) and applied to reliability engineering problems. Three engineering examples, including two static problems and one time-varying problem, are given to illustrate the good appli-cability and capability of the proposed methods for structural reliability analysis.

AB Background. This article aims to determine the coefficients that will reduce the inclass distance and increase the distance between the classes, collecting the data around the cluster centers with meta-heuristic optimization algorithms, thus increasing the classification performance.Methods. The proposed mathematical model is based on simple mathematical calculations, and this model is the fitness function of optimization algorithms. Compared to the methods in the literature, optimizing algorithms to obtain fast results is more accessible. Determining the weights by optimization provides more sensitive results than the dataset structure. In the study, the proposed model was used as the fitness function of the metaheuristic optimization algorithms to determine the weighting coefficients. In this context, four different structures were used to test the independence of the results obtained from the algorithm: the particle swarm algorithm (PSO), the bat algorithm (BAT), the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), and the flower pollination algorithm (FPA).Results. As a result of these processes, a control group from unweighted attributes and four experimental groups from weighted attributes were obtained for each dataset. The classification performance of all datasets to which the weights obtained by the proposed method were applied increased. 100% accuracy rates were obtained in the Iris and Liver Disorders datasets used in the study. From synthetic datasets, from 66.9% (SVM classifier) to 96.4% (GSA Weighting + SVM) in the Full Chain dataset, from 64.6% (LDA classifier) to 80.2% in the Two Spiral datasets (weighted by BA + LDA). As a result of the study, it was seen that the proposed method successfully fulfills the task of moving the attributes to a linear plane in the datasets, especially in classifiers such as SVM and LDA, which have difficulties in non-linear problems, an accuracy rate of 100% was achieved.

AB The devastating effect of plant disease infestation on crop production poses a significant threat to the attainment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG2) of food security, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This has been further exacerbated by the lack of effective and accessible plant disease detection technologies. Farmers' inability to quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases leads to crop destruction and reduced productivity. The diverse range of existing plant diseases further complicates detection for farmers without the right technologies, hindering efforts to combat food insecurity in the region. This study presents a web-based plant diagnosis application, referred to as mobile-enabled Plant Diagnosis-Application (mPD-App). First, a publicly available image dataset, containing a diverse range of plant diseases, was acquired from Kaggle for the purpose of training the detection system. The image dataset was, then, made to undergo the preprocessing stage which included processes such as image-to-array conversion, image reshaping, and data augmentation. The training phase leverages the vast computational ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to effectively classify image datasets. The CNN model architecture featured six convolutional layers (including the fully connected layer) with phases, such as normalization layer, rectified linear unit (RELU), max pooling layer, and dropout layer. The training process was carefully managed to prevent underfitting and overfitting of the model, ensuring accurate predictions. The mPD-App demonstrated excellent performance in diagnosing plant diseases, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.91%. The model was able to classify 14 different types of plant diseases with high precision and recall values. The ROC curve showed a promising area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.946, indicating the model's reliability in detecting diseases. The web-based mPD-App offers a valuable tool for farmers and agricultural stakeholders in Sub-Saharan Africa, to detect and diagnose plant diseases effectively and efficiently. To further improve the application's performance, ongoing efforts should focus on expanding the dataset and refining the model's architecture. Agricultural authorities and policymakers should consider promoting and integrating such technologies into existing agricultural extension services to maximize their impact and benefit the farming community.

AB IntroductionSupernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) is a novel category of wearable robotics. Unlike prostheses (compensation for human limbs) and exoskeletons (augmentation of human limbs), SRL focuses on expanding human limbs and enhancing human activities, perception, and operation through the mutual collaboration of mechanical limbs and human limbs. The SRL of lower limbs are attached to the human waist, synchronized with the human walking in the forward direction, and can carry weight independently in the vertical direction.MethodsIn order to enhance the synchronization performance of the human-machine system during walking and minimize interference with human gait, it is essential to investigate the coupling dynamics within the human-SRL system. To facilitate our research, this paper focuses on relatively ideal working conditions: level road surfaces, no additional weight-bearing on the SRL, and humans walking in a straight line without any turns. We build upon the passive dynamic walking theory and utilize the human-SRL system model established by MIT to develop a coupling system model. Through numerical simulations, we identify the optimal values for the stiffness and damping coefficients of the human-machine connection. Additionally, we have designed the wheel-legged SRL structure and constructed the SRL control system for experimental validation.ResultsIt is found that a better synchronization of the human-machine walking process can be achieved by configuring suitable spring and damping units in the human-machine connection part.DiscussionIn this study, we explored the concept of SRL and its potential benefits for enhancing human motion, conducting simulations and experiments based on the coupled dynamics of human-SRL systems. The results indicate that by equipping the human-machine connection component with suitable spring and damping units, synchronization during the walking process can be improved.

AB For a steam heating network (SHN), which is one of the most important parts of the integrated energy systems in an industrial park, it is essential to provide accurate and reliable estimation of hydraulic and thermal states, to ensure its operational safety and economy. Considering two different time-scale characteristics of the hydraulic and thermal processes in the SHN, this article proposes a mechanism and data-driven dual estimation method for the coupling hydraulic-thermal dynamic states. Due to the fact that the existing coupled estimation methods with one time scale may suffer from heavy computational burden, a data-driven dual sequential DSE method of the SHN is proposed based on the two-time scales, in which the dynamics of slow thermal states can also be captured when performing the SE of the fast hydraulic process. Furthermore, to improve the computational and communicational efficiency, a distributed interaction strategy based on the nodal transformation matrix is designed for large-scale steam systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a single pipeline system and two real-world industrial superheated steam networks are employed. Compared to other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves the best tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.

AB Modeling contextual relationships in images as graph inference is an interesting and promising research topic. However, existing approaches only perform graph modeling of entities, ignoring the intrinsic geometric features of images. To overcome this problem, a novel multiresolution interpretable contourlet graph network (MICGNet) is proposed in this article. MICGNet delicately balances graph representation learning with the multiscale and multidirectional features of images, where contourlet is used to capture the hyperplanar directional singularities of images and multilevel sparse contourlet coefficients are encoded into graph for further graph representation learning. This process provides interpretable theoretical support for optimizing the model structure. Specifically, first, the superpixel-based region graph is constructed. Then, the region graph is applied to code the nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) coefficients of the image, which are considered as node features. Considering the statistical properties of the NSCT coefficients, we calculate the node similarity, i.e., the adjacency matrix, using Mahalanobis distance. Next, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are employed to further learn more abstract multilevel NSCT-enhanced graph representations. Finally, the learnable graph assignment matrix is designed to get the geometric association representations, which accomplish the assignment of graph representations to grid feature maps. We conduct comparative experiments on six publicly available datasets, and the experimental analysis shows that MICGNet is significantly more effective and efficient than other algorithms of recent years.

AB The advancement of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications has increased the demand for efficient and energy-aware task scheduling in fog-cloud environments. This paper presents a novel multi-objective energy efficient task scheduling based reinforcement learning (MEETS-RL) model for fog-cloud IIoT-based systems. The IIoT, fog, and cloud are the three layers obtained in the proposed method. Tasks are captured from various industries through industrial devices such as actuators, sensors, and control systems placed near fog nodes. The task classification stage utilizes the ID3 algorithm to classify tasks based on their priority, Quality of Service (QoS), and processing requirements. After classification, appropriate fog nodes are selected for task execution considering factors such as energy consumption, processing capabilities, and proximity to IIoT devices. The unhandled task in fog nodes is offloaded to cloud data centers using the first fit (FF) algorithm, based on available resources, QoS requirements, and fog node location. Once the suitable fog nodes or cloud data centers have been identified, the tasks are scheduled for execution using a reinforcement learning-based task scheduling algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MEETS-RL model outperforms existing task scheduling models, including first come first serve (FCFS), greedy for energy (GfE), shortest job first (SJF), round Robin (RR), and Laxity based priority with Ant colony system (LBP-ACS). The experimental results of the proposed architecture showed an accuracy rate of 98.8%, task completion rate of 95% and energy consumption of 0.4 J. The proposed architecture offers a comprehensive solution for modern IIoT systems demanding flexibility, scalability, and efficient resource management while enhancing energy efficiency through the application of reinforcement learning in task scheduling.

AB In the last few decades, technological improvements have had a considerable impact on education, much like many other fields of society and human endeavor. The applications of today's cutting-edge technology are numerous in education, but recently researchers focused on using these technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), for students' performance prediction prior to the exam. It makes perfect sense to forecast student success to help all participants in the educational process. Student performance prediction may assist them in the selection of suitable courses and in creating their academic schedules. Keeping in mind the importance of student performance evaluation, this paper analyzes the prediction rate of college English level 4 by using one of the powerful ML algorithms called random forest (RF). RF uses numerous classifiers, or "ensembles", rather than just one classifier, and is based on the decision tree technique. To do this, we constructed input and output variables and collected data for these variables, including basic student information (gender, ethnicity, major), English scores on college admission exams, college English scores (total of four semesters), and extracurricular activities of college students. Preprocessing was performed on the collected data, which included the removal of unnecessary attributes, handling outliers, normalization, and data cleaning. After the preprocessing, the features were extracted and transformed into reduced dimensionality by the local-preserving projection (LPP) algorithm. From the extracted features, we selected only the most relevant in order to feed them as input to the RF model. The model is implemented in MATLAB in order to evaluate its performance. The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with the help of experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of the model. The performance of the RF algorithm-based college English IV pass rate prediction model is evaluated by computing the prediction accuracy, recall rate, and hit rate of the classification results. We achieved a prediction accuracy of 96.5%, a recall rate of 89.5%, and a hit rate of 93.3%. The results show that the random RF-based prediction model for college English level 4 has a good classification effect and that the prediction results are more accurate.

AB With the rapid development of technology, institutes are now managing police records by using digital systems. These systems collect data from numerous individuals and create big-data repositories. However, the risks associated with data tampering or leakage highlight the need for strong management strategies. Existing electronic archives have experienced data loss, tampering, and unauthorized disclosure, emphasizing the urgency of reforming police data management practices. Blockchain technology offers promising solutions for securing employer information owing to its traceability and resistance to tampering. However, the application of blockchain technology in police data management poses challenges. The limitations of blockchain in storage capacity and processing speed hinder the handling of vast datasets. We propose a police-data management system that utilizes blockchain technology. Our innovative approach integrates both on-chain and off-chain storage mechanisms, effectively eliminating concerns related to data security and insufficient storage capacity. We created a prototype system to validate the feasibility of using a blockchain for managing information. With this system, users can easily perform operations, such as data queries, additions, modifications, and data tracking. We are also exploring the synergies between blockchain and big data and envision a powerful combination of technologies that can further improve the security and efficiency of police data management. The proposed system represents a strategic response to the challenges of contemporary data management. By innovatively combining the blockchain's strength with a nuanced storage model, we formulated a robust system to transform police information management and security. We have compared our proposed framework with different schemes that demonstrate that our scheme is highly secure to deal with different attacks that can be deployed in different environments.

AB This study aims to use the theory of iterative control algorithm to learn and extract the semantic structural features of large-scale network data by analyzing and exploring the semantic structural features of large-scale networks with the help of data visualization analysis methods. In addition, it conducts relevant research on the high-quality simplified representation of computer network graphs based on the effective extraction of structural features and combined with graph sampling techniques. An iterative learning control algorithm based on reference trajectory update is proposed for the tracking control problem of discrete linear control system output subject to non-repetitive perturbation. First, the controller is parametrically optimized by constructing a performance index function to track the system output quickly and accurately at the desired point of reference trajectory update. Second, when the system output is affected by a batch of non-repetitive perturbations, a new performance indicator function is further constructed by introducing a Lagrange multiplier algorithm to establish multi-objective performance indicators to optimize the robust iterative learning controller. Finally, the algorithm is applied to a computer network graph design system, and the simulation results verify the reasonableness and effectiveness of the algorithm. These results show that the suggested technique surpassed the existing approaches with accomplishments such as an average degree of 12.5%, a clustering coefficient of 65%, network efficiency of 91%, and higher modularity, community identification, and network embedding scores.

AB A unique hybrid meta-heuristic combining the salp swarm algorithm and the sine cosine algorithm (SSCA) is established in this study to improve convergence speed while outperforming existing conventional algorithms. The sine cosine position equations are utilized to update the position of the salp leader in search space while a weighting factor updates the position of the salp follower so that the best and possible optimal solutions are obtained using the sine or cosine and weighting function. Particle swarm optimization PSO inspires this weighting factor. Each salp uses the information-sharing approach of sine and cosine functions during this process to strengthen their exploration and exploitation abilities. The goal of incorporating modifications to the salp swarm optimizer algorithm is to help the standard approach avoid premature convergence that leads the search to the most likely search space. The proposed algorithm is tested on classical optimization benchmark functions and eight real engineering applications. The goal is to investigate and validate the SSCA's proper behaviour while finding the optimum solutions. The results of the comparison demonstrated that the SSCA method achieves the best accuracies.

AB Import and export commerce is a significant strategy for stimulating national economic growth and realizing foreign exchange. Based on the above, this research work dives into the delicate link between changes in China's peripheral diplomatic relations and their resultant consequences on export commerce in China's quickly developing global environment. It provides a unique combined forecasting model that combines autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time-series analysis with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to answer the pressing demand for accurate forecasts in this dynamic setting. First, a forecasting model is established for the influencing factors and volume of import and export trade of ASEAN. Second, it establishes the regression equation with the econometrics method by analyzing the specific impact of each influencing factor on the forecasting target. Moreover, it uses data statistics to mathematically process the historical data of ASEAN's import and export volume by determining the correlation between ASEAN's trade volume and some influencing factors. Regression analysis is often used to find relationships between variables. Adding ARIMA time-series modeling improves the model's prediction capabilities, providing a comprehensive insight into China-ASEAN import and export trade volume dynamics. Finally, it compares the performance of the suggested forecasting model to existing approaches, which proves that the correlation rate is enhanced to above 90%. In contrast, other error rates, including the average root, are decreased to the square error. These results show that the prediction model based on the combination of time series and LSTM produces the best short-term forecast of China and ASEAN import and export volume.

AB Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are widely employed in microscale applications to generate power from waste-heat energy emitted by nonrenewable energy sources. The energy extracted from TEG is dependent on the temperature gradient across the hot- and cold-ends along with the electrical load applied. Therefore, a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control is strongly preferred to constantly track the optimal point of TEG under diverse operational conditions. In this study, a new MPPT-based metaheuristic optimizer so-called Honey badger algorithm (HBA) is implemented to maximize the energy efficiency of TEG systems. The proposed technique seeks to optimize the dynamic response and eradicate oscillations near MPP. Various dynamic operating conditions are used to investigate the reliability of the optimized HBA-based MPPT method. The obtained results are compared with other energy harvesting approaches including incremental conductance (INC), hybrid gray wolf optimizer-sine cosine algorithm (HGWOSCA), and marine predators algorithm (MPA). The major findings verify that the employed optimized HBA method achieved highest power tracking efficiency more than 99% with smallest tracking time up to 120 ms and maintaining a steady-state output at the different studied scenarios.

ID SCHEME
AB Vehicle-to-vehicle charging and discharging energy exchange among electric vehicles (EVs) achieve economical and low-loss energy transactions. However, due to the openness of the border, EV power trading faces security issues. When an EV user communicates with a local aggregator, attackers may eavesdrop on the communication links to perform traffic analysis attacks. Moreover, unregistered illegal users may parade themselves as legitimate users and submit a bill query request to the local aggregator. In this paper, we develop a decentralized EV charging service architecture to defend against traffic analysis attacks and prevent users from tampering with transaction bills. Based on the architecture, we propose a blockchain-based secure transaction mechanism for electronic vehicles with multiple temporary identities. Specifically, we first propose a power transaction encryption protocol that utilizes multiple temporary identities to publish information streams, thereby preventing eavesdropping attacks and making the assignment between suppliers and demanders. We then propose a secure query transaction scheme that adds the accumulator value of the user's temporary identity into the Merkle tree, which identifies the query issued by legitimate users and verifies the query results. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed secure transaction mechanism promotes the user satisfaction and user utility by 5% and 10%, respectively, and promotes the security level by three times.

TI Hand-Controller Latency and Aiming Accuracy in 6-DOF VR
SO ADVANCES IN HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA English
DT Article
ID TRACKING; ROBOT
AB All virtual reality (VR) systems have some inherent hand-controller latency even when operated locally. In remotely rendered VR, additional latency may be added due to the remote transmission of data, commonly conducted through shared low-capacity channels. Increased latency will negatively affect the performance of the human VR operator, but the level of detriment depends on the given task. This work quantifies the relations between aiming accuracy and hand-controller latency, virtual target speed, and the predictability of the target motion. The tested context involves a target that changes direction multiple times while moving in straight lines. The main conclusions are, given the tested context, first, that the predictability of target motion becomes significantly more important as latency and target speed increase. A significant difference in accuracy is generally observed at latencies beyond approximately 130 ms and at target speeds beyond approximately 3.5 degrees/s. Second, latency starts to significantly impact accuracy at roughly 90 ms and approximately 3.5 degrees/s if the target motion cannot be predicted. If it can, the numbers are approximately 130 ms and 12.7 degrees/s. Finally, reaction times are on average 190-200 ms when the target motion changes to a new and unpredictable direction.

AB This study aimed to develop an evaluation tool that assesses the use of AI-based decision support systems (DSSs) in professional practice from a human-centered perspective. Following the International Organization for Standardization, this perspective aims to ensure that the use of interactive technologies improves users' psychological load experience and behavior, e.g., in the form of reduced stress experience or increased performance. Concomitantly, this perspective attempts to proactively prevent or detect and correct the potential negative effects of these technologies on user load, such as impaired satisfaction and engagement, as early as possible. Based on this perspective, we developed and validated a questionnaire instrument, the Psychological Assessment of AI-based DSSs (PAAI), for the user-centered evaluation of the use of AI-based DSSs in practice. In particular, the instrument considers central design characteristics of AI-based DSSs and the corresponding work situation, which have a significant impact on users' psychological load. The instrument was tested in two independent studies. In Study 1, N = 223 individuals were recruited. Based on the results of item and scale analyses and an exploratory factor analysis, the newly developed instrument was refined, and the final version was tested using a confirmatory factor analysis. Findings showed acceptable-to-good fit indices, confirming the factorial validity of the PAAI. This was confirmed in a second study, which had N = 471 participants. Again, the CFA yielded acceptable-to-good fit indices. The validity was further confirmed using convergent and criterion validity analyses.

First, we use an enhanced concentric circle approximation unfolding algorithm to unfold the panoramic images captured by the catadioptric panoramic camera and then extract the effective regions. In addition, the integration of the Non-local attention mechanism is exploited to improve image understanding. Finally, a depth smoothness loss strategy is implemented to further enhance the reliability and precision of the estimated depths. Experimental results confirm that this refined algorithm is capable of providing highly accurate estimates of object depth.

AB This article presents an event-triggered adaptive NN command-filtered control for a class of multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with unknown rate-dependent hysteresis in the actuator and the constraints on full states. The ETM is used to reduce the communication frequency between controller and actuator. The command filter technique is first employed to solve the dilemma between the nondifferentiable control signal at triggering instants and rate-dependent hysteresis input premise while avoiding the "explosion of complexity" problem. During the backstepping design, the barrier Lyapunov functions are utilized to guarantee that system states will stay in certain regions and the unknown nonlinear items are approximated by adaptive neural networks. The compensating signals are constructed to eliminate filtering errors. The estimates of unknown hysteresis parameters are updated by adaptive laws. The stability analysis is given and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation.

ID NUCLEAR NORM MINIMIZATION; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; ALGORITHM
AB Most existing image denoising methods commonly assume that the image is contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). However, real-world color image noise exhibits more complicated distribution properties, making it challenging to develop an accurate model. Consequently, denoising methods designed for AWGN often fail to achieve satisfactory performance on real-world images. In this paper, we present a novel multi-channel optimization model for real-world color images denoising within the multi-weighted Schatten p-norm minimization. Our proposed model utilizes the weighted Schatten p-norm as the regularization term, while the data fidelity term employs two weight matrices to balance the noise level across channels and regions. Besides, it helps to preserve as much detail as possible in the recovered image while removing noise. Although our proposed model is nonconvex and has no analytical solution, an accurate and efficient optimization algorithm is established based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) framework. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models on three real image datasets.

AB Decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRS), produced by Bayesian risk minimum principle and three-way decision theory, is a novel methodology to deal with risk decision problems. As one of the two basic concepts in DTRS, conditional probability is used for measuring the probability of objects belonging to different states. The calculation of condition probability needs a complete information system as prior information. However, we often encounter complicate scenario where prior information is lacking, it is more common that several agents may be involved in a decision process and give their opinion. To model uncertain information of experts' assessment, a Generalized Decision-Theoretic Rough Sets based on Evidence Theory (GDTRSET) is put forward in this paper. The proposed GDTRSET extends the set of states by introducing a new uncertain state. Correspondingly, instead of using conditional probability in DTRS, basic probability assignment in evidence theory is utilized for describing the belief of objects belonging to different states. The proposed GDTRSET first discusses the determination of conditional probability without prior information, which can handle uncertain information efficiently and flexibly. Besides, a unified framework for classification based on the proposed GDTRSET is presented, taking advantage of three-way and risk decision perspectives for classification. A case study of the Iris dataset is finally illustrated the efficiency of the proposed GDTRSET.

AB The paper aims is to present a multi-criteria decision-making algorithm for solving decision-making problems with the utilization of the C-IFSs (circular intuitionistic fuzzy sets) features. In it, the uncertainties present in the data are handled with the help of C-IFSs in which we considers the circular rating of each object within a certain radius. Later on, we propose a novel algebraic framework for C-IFSs based on Archimedean t-norm operations, including addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. These operations enable the aggregation of preferences from multiple experts into a single ranking. Also, we propose an extended EDAS (Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution) method, which utilizes weighted aggregation operators and defuzzification techniques to rank alternatives. To validate our approach, we provide a numerical example and compare the results with existing methods. Additionally, we discuss the time complexity of the algorithm. The proposed methodology offers decision-makers the flexibility to analyze the influence of different ratings on the final decision and select suitable parameters.

ID AVOIDANCE
AB This paper addresses the multi-agent formation obstacle avoidance (MAFOA) problem using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). MAFOA control aims to achieve and maintain a desired formation while avoiding collisions among agents or with obstacles. It is a research hotspot in multi-agent cooperation due to its wide applications and challenges. However, current MADRL methods face two major difficulties in solving this problem: 1) the high complexity and uncertainty of the environment when there are many agents; 2) the lack of scalability when the number of agents varies. To overcome these difficulties, we propose: 1) A local multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm that allows each agent to learn from its local neighbors' strategies during training and act independently during execution; 2) A reinforcement learning framework based on local information that uses partial observation as input and adapts to different numbers of agents; 3) A hybrid control method that switches between reinforcement learning and PID control to ensure formation stability. We evaluate our method on the multiagent particle environment environment and compare it with other algorithms to demonstrate its feasibility and superiority for solving the MAFOA problem.

SO APPLIED INTELLIGENCE

DE LIME; Stability; Local fidelity; Variational autoencoder
AB For humans to trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, it is essential for machine learning (ML) models to be interpretable to users. For example, the judicial process requires that AI conclusions must be rigorous and absolutely interpretable. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, VAE-SLIME, for providing stable local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (SLIME) based on a variational autoencoder (VAE). LIME is a technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner. Despite the great success of LIME, the most popular method in this category, it has several disadvantages due to its random perturbation-based sampling method. The VAE-SLIME proposed in this paper is specifically designed to address the lack of stability and local fidelity exhibited by LIME for tabular data. VAE-SLIME first employs fixed noise to replace the random Gaussian noise used by the reparameterization trick of the VAE. Then, it uses this new VAE model instead of random perturbation method to generate stable samples. By considering the sequential relationship and flipping of features, a novel explanation stability evaluation metric, the feature sequence stability index (FSSI), is introduced to accurately evaluate the stability of explanations. In a comparison with 6 state-of-the-art approaches on 7 commonly used tabular datasets, the experimental results show beyond doubt that the explanations produced by our approach are most stable, and its local fidelity is 65.17% higher than that of other approaches on average.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) haven proven to be an indispensable approach in modeling complex data, in particular spatial temporal data, e.g., relating to sensor data given as time series with according spatial information. Although GNNs provide powerful modeling capabilities on such kind of data, they require adequate input data in terms of both signal and the underlying graph structures. However, typically the according graphs are not automatically available or even predefined, such that typically an ad hoc graph representation needs to be constructed. However, often the construction of the underlying graph structure is given insufficient attention. Therefore, this paper performs an in-depth analysis of several methods for constructing graphs from a set of sensors attributed with spatial information, i.e., geographical coordinates, or using their respective attached signal data. We apply a diverse set of standard methods for estimating groups and similarities between graph nodes as location-based as well as signal-driven approaches on multiple benchmark datasets for evaluation and assessment. Here, for both areas, we specifically include distance-based, clustering-based, as well as correlation-based approaches for estimating the relationships between nodes for subsequent graph construction. In addition, we consider two different GNN approaches, i.e., regression and forecasting in order to enable a broader experimental assessment. Typically, no predefined graph is given, such that (ad hoc) graph creation is necessary. Here, our results indicate the criticality of factoring in the crucial step of graph construction into GNN-based research on spatial temporal data. Overall, in our experimentation no single approach for graph construction emerged as a clear winner. However, in our analysis we are able to provide specific indications based on the obtained results, for a specific class of methods. Collectively, the findings highlight the need for researchers to carefully consider graph construction when employing GNNs in the analysis of spatial temporal data.

AB Count data regression is one of the widely used techniques for modelling medical data and has applications in various other fields as well. Count data usually exhibits the characteristic of over-dispersion and new models are developed to open up the opportunity to model such kind of data. This paper introduces a new probability model namely two parameter Poisson-Xgamma distribution and its associated count data regression model is also developed. The structural properties of the proposed probability model like moments, skewness, kurtosis and generating functions among others have been derived. The parameter estimation for the proposed model is discussed using two well-known methods. A Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to investigate the finite sample behavior of maximum likelihood estimates for parameters of new regression model. Furthermore, the empirical applications of the proposed probability model and its associated regression model are validated using two health care data sets. Based on some famous statistical criteria, the proposed model demonstrates better fitting results as compared to other existing discrete models.

AB Predicting software faults at the primary stage is a challenging role for software engineers and tech industries. During the development of software projects, it is necessary to predict the number of probable faults to have occurred on software rather than detecting whether the software modules are faulty or not. Discovering the number of expected faults helps software professionals to develop more reliable and high-quality software systems. However, the prediction model's performance gets affected while dealing with complicated software projects with increased cost factors such as time, effort, and resources. Therefore, to address the issue associated with handling complex software projects, a novel weighted dual cross-recurrent network-based levy sparrow search (WDCRN-LSS) model is proposed in this paper. The WDCRN-LSS approach by learning the data features with optimal hyperparameters accurately predicts the expected software faults in an earlier phase. Here, 17 PROMISE datasets containing 20 features each are utilized as input data for the proposed WDCRN-LSS model. The data inconsistencies are eliminated and then transformed to a suitable format for training through normalization, data transformation, and label encoding procedures. The preprocessed data are then trained using the proposed WDCRN-LSS model for the prediction of the expected number of software faults in the projects. With the excellent learning capability of feature representations, the proposed WDCRN-LSS model predicts software faults on upcoming/under-development software projects precisely. Thus, the proposed WDCRN-LSS model enhances software quality and minimizes cost factors such as time, resources, and effort that are depleted in developing software. The proposed WDCRN-LSS model's efficiency is investigated by utilizing evaluation measures namely error rate, precision, recall, F1-measure, the area under the curve, accuracy, and specificity. The experimental result manifests the efficiency of the proposed WDCRN-LSS model with a software fault detection accuracy of about 98.1%.

TI SR-HetGNN: session-based recommendation with heterogeneous graph neural

AB The session-based recommendation system aims to predict the user's next click based on their previous session sequence. The current studies generally learn user preferences according to the transitions of items in the user's session sequence. However, other effective information in the session sequence, such as user profiles, is largely ignored which may lead to the model unable to learn the user's specific preferences. In this paper, we propose SR-HetGNN, a novel session recommendation method that uses a heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) to learn session embeddings and capture the specific preferences of anonymous users. Specifically, SR-HetGNN first constructs heterogeneous graphs containing various types of nodes according to the session sequence, which can capture the dependencies among items, users, and sessions. Second, HetGNN captures the complex transitions between items and learns the item embeddings containing user information. Finally, local and global session embeddings are combined with the attentional network to obtain the final session embedding, considering the influence of users' long and short-term preferences. SR-HetGNN is shown to be superior to the existing state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods through extensive experiments over two real large datasets Diginetica and Tmall. The code and datasets can be found in our GitHub repository https://github.com/LeeHY1996/SR-HetGNN.

DT Article
AB In multitask retrieval, a single retriever is trained to retrieve relevant contexts for multiple tasks. Despite its practical appeal, naive multitask retrieval lags behind task-specific retrieval, in which a separate retriever is trained for each task. We show that it is possible to train a multitask retriever that outperforms task-specific retrievers by promoting task specialization. The main ingredients are: (1) a better choice of pretrained model-one that is explicitly optimized for multitasking-along with compatible prompting, and (2) a novel adaptive learning method that encourages each parameter to specialize in a particular task. The resulting multitask retriever is highly performant on the KILT benchmark. Upon analysis, we find that the model indeed learns parameters that are more task-specialized compared to naive multitasking without prompting or adaptive learning.1

AB Analyzing and evaluating legal case reports are labor-intensive tasks for judges and lawyers, who usually base their decisions on report abstracts, legal principles, and commonsense reasoning. Thus, summarizing legal documents is time-consuming and requires excellent human expertise. Moreover, public legal corpora of specific languages are almost unavailable. This paper proposes a transfer learning approach with extractive and abstractive techniques to cope with the lack of labeled legal summarization datasets, namely a low-resource scenario. In particular, we conducted extensive multi- and cross-language experiments. The proposed work outperforms the state-of-the-art results of extractive summarization on the Australian Legal Case Reports dataset and sets a new baseline for abstractive summarization. Finally, syntactic and semantic metrics assessments have been carried out to evaluate the accuracy and the factual consistency of the machine-generated legal summaries.

AB In the field of human-computer interaction, there is a trend toward using emotional interaction and putting emotions at the center. However, traditional facial expression recognition is greatly affected by lighting, skin color and make-up, and is not well recognized. This paper addresses these shortcomings in the following areas: (1) The algorithm of infrared face feature localization is studied, using a combination of region growing algorithm to highlight the organ features of infrared faces, and the Harris corner point detection algorithm to detect the organ features of human beings and locate the location of the large organs related to expressions, such as eyes, nose and mouth. (2) The algorithm for feature extraction is investigated, and the local binarization LBP algorithm is proposed to extract the texture features of the infrared face. The LBP algorithm is synthesized to extract the overall LBP features by applying the innovation of chunking and layering of features. By analyzing and processing the infrared face image data from both visible and infrared face expression data, feature detection, feature extraction and effective classification of the four basic face expressions - happy, angry, disgusted and sad - are performed on the infrared images. The application of the algorithm is processed and improved accordingly to the characteristics of infrared face images, which improves the accuracy of recognition and classification compared to traditional methods.

AB The H-8 state feedback control problem of Takagi-Sugneo (T-S) fuzzy system with dynamic quantization and event-triggered mechanism is studied in this paper. Based on T-S fuzzy model, a new quantization scheme is proposed to solve the problem of synchronous quantization and event-triggered mechanism in continuous-time system. A new event-triggered communication scheme is proposed to improve the utilization rate of network resources. The sufficient conditions for the stability of H-8 state feedback control are given by means of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a simulation of the spring-mass-damping system.

AB The left/right projection matrix and recovery matrix used for the reconstruction error in the traditional generalized low-rank approximation of matrix models are the same and orthogonal, which makes the model inflexible. To this end, we propose the flexible sparse robust low-rank approximation of matrices model to integrate feature selection into subspace learning and to exclude the redundant features. In the proposed model, two recovery matrices are introduced to together recover the original image data from the subspace spanned by the selected features, resulting in more freedom and flexible to jointly select useful features for low-dimensional representation. Moreover, the L1-norm is imposed on the reconstruction error and L2,1-norm on the Kronecker product of left and right transformation matrices, which can reduce the influence of noise on errors and perform feature selection while learning the optimal transformation matrices and recovery matrices. According to some theoretical analysis, an alternative iterative solution method is designed, and the convergence and time complexity of the algorithm are analyzed. The experimental results on some image datasets show that our method is superior to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

AB The position of vehicles is determined using an algorithm that includes two stages of detection and prediction. The more the number of frames in which the detection network is used, the more accurate the detector is, and the more the prediction network is used, the algorithm is faster. Therefore, the algorithm is very flexible to achieve the required accuracy and speed. YOLO's base detection network is designed to be robust against vehicle scale changes. Also, feature maps are produced in the detector network, which contribute greatly to increasing the accuracy of the detector. In these maps, using differential images and a u-net-based module, image segmentation has been done into two classes: vehicle and background. To increase the accuracy of the recursive predictive network, vehicle manoeuvres are classified. For this purpose, the spatial and temporal information of the vehicles are considered simultaneously. This classifier is much more effective than classifiers that consider spatial and temporal information separately. The Highway and UA-DETRAC datasets demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in urban traffic monitoring systems.
   Vehicle position is determined using an algorithm that includes two stages: detection and prediction. In certain frames, a detection network is employed, and in others prediction network is used. The algorithms' accuracy and speed both grow with detection and prediction, respectively.image

DE Social network; Influence maximization; Independent cascade model;
   Online algorithm
AB We study the online influence maximization problem in social networks. We concentrate on solving two challenges in this paper. First, we work with continuousindependentcascademodel instead of independentcascademodel. In the independent cascade model, the influence diffusion is limited and imprecise because an activated node can only attempt to impact a neighbor through a directed edge for once. Therefore, we propose a continuous influence set and combine this set with the independent cascade model to build a continuous independent cascade model, which realizes multiple activation and can be more customized to attract more targeted users. Second, we devise node-edge-levelfeedback instead of node-levelfeedback. In the node-level feedback, though the combined influence is relatively easy to observe, the exact edge which cause the influence seldom reveals. Therefore, we use node-edge-level feedback to generate the source nodes which activate the active node. We improve the IMFB algorithm and propose the CIC_IMFB-NE algorithm. The CIC_IMFB-NE algorithm is more efficient than the existing online influence maximization algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the excellence of CIC_IMFB-NE in terms of regret bound in real life.

AB Mobility trajectory data is of great significance for mobility pattern study, urban computing, and city science. Self-driving, traffic prediction, environment estimation, and many other applications require large-scale mobility trajectory datasets. However, mobility trajectory data acquisition is challenging due to privacy concerns, commercial considerations, missing values, and expensive deployment costs. Nowadays, mobility trajectory data generation has become an emerging trend in reducing the difficulty of mobility trajectory data acquisition by generating principled data. Despite the popularity of mobility trajectory data generation, literature surveys on this topic are rare. In this paper, we present a survey for mobility trajectory generation by artificial intelligence from knowledge-driven and data-driven views. Specifically, we will give a taxonomy of the literature of mobility trajectory data generation, examine mainstream theories and techniques as well as application scenarios for generating mobility trajectory data, and discuss some critical challenges facing this area.

ID ALGORITHM
AB This paper addresses the problem of dynamic multi- objective optimization problems (DMOPs), by demonstrating new approaches to change detection and change prediction in an evolutionary algorithm framework. Because the objectives of such problems change over time, the Pareto optimal set (PS) and Pareto optimal front (PF) are also dynamic. First, we propose a new change detection method which achieves greater sensitivity by considering changes in both the PS and the PF, unlike most previous approaches. Second, when changes occur, a second-order (acceleration-based) prediction strategy is proposed to predictively reinitialize the population close to the new set of optima. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against two other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature, using ten different dynamic benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed change detection strategy in this paper can not only consider the effect of the optimal individuals but also can consider the effect of their corresponding objective values. Compared with the other two methods, the DMOPs achieved both the ability of precisely predicting the direction of changes and the ability of predicting the future trend of change direction. So, the DMOPs can also converge to the true PF in much less iterations compared with other methods. After multiple experiments, the proposed method outperforms the other algorithms on most of the test problems.

ID STROKE
AB Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals collected by wearables have been shown to be effective in accurate detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), provided that the data are devoid of motion and noise artifacts (MNA). Many studies have been previously conducted to detect AF arrhythmia using PPG data; however, the subjects were mostly in clinics or controlled settings with data collection lasting several minutes to at most several hours with minimal MNA. Our study, Pulsewatch, differs from previous AF studies in that PPG data from smartwatches prescribed to stroke survivors were continuously collected for two weeks in real-life conditions, which invariably included a significant amount of MNA. Our aim is to provide a framework for a novel use of a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct motion-artifact-removed PPG signals so that we can improve the AF detection per-formance and to increase the amount of analyzable data.We used more than 30,000 25-sec PPG segments from 129 subjects randomly selected from Pulsewatch and Stanford University's datasets. The training and testing datasets from these two databases came from smart-watches from different vendors with varying sampling frequencies and time duration of recordings in diverse and realistic settings. In this study, the highly corrupted PPG data were automatically detected and discarded, but those segments contaminated with low-to-moderate motion and noise artifacts (MNA) were subjected to a convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDA). To reconstruct the artifact-removed PPG segments, we proposed to employ two distinct CDA models for AF and non-AF data groups initially classified as AF or non-AF. Using the proposed approach, we significantly improved the performance of detecting occult AF. We achieved classifica-tion accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.02%, 91.54%, and 90.85%, respectively, for out-of-sample test data from both databases. By sanitizing data from low-to-moderate MNA, we were able to increase the usable data coverage by 21%.

AB One of the leading-edge technologies that have made it possible to pay as you go and distribute appropriate resources on demand is cloud computing. The process of optimizing the resource on cloud virtual machines (VMs) is called load balancing. The main goal is to evenly distribute tasks and resources among all machines to ensure that no node is overloaded or inactive. However, the load balancing methods currently used in cloud environments are ineffective in lowering the amount of time needed to respond to requests. This work intends to propose a novel optimal load balancing (LB) method in the cloud. For this a new Intercrossed Chimp and Bald Eagle Algorithm (IC&BA) algorithm is introduced that combines the algorithms like bald eagle search (BES) optimization and chimp optimization (CA) algorithm. Thereby, the proposed load balancing model works under the consideration of (i) Energy Consumption (ii) execution cost (iii) migration cost (iv) Make span and (v) load balancing parameters like response time, Turnaround time.

AB Consumer preference prediction aims to predict consumers' future purchases based on their historical behavior-level data. Using machine learning algorithms, the prediction results provide evidence to conduct commercial activities and further improve consumer experiences. However, missing values and imbalanced class problems of consumer behavioral data always make machine learning algorithms ineffective. While several methods have been proposed to address missing data or imbalanced class problems, few works have considered the relation-ships among missing mechanisms, imputation algorithms, imbalanced class methods, and the effectiveness of classification algorithms that use impute data. In this study, we aim to propose an adaptive process for selecting the optimal combination of amputation, imputation, imbalance treatment, and classification based on classifi-cation performance. Our research extends the literature by showing significant interaction effects between 1) the amputation mechanism and imputation algorithms, 2) imputation and imbalance treatments, and 3) imbalance treatments and classification algorithms. Using three consumer behavioral datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we empirically show that, among different classification methods, the overall performance of Random Forest is better than that of Logit, SVM, or Decision Tree. Moreover, Logit, as the most widely used classification method, suffers most from imbalance issues in real-world datasets. Furthermore, Metacost is always the best imbalance treatment for different imputation techniques or missing value mechanisms.

AB Soft pneumatic biomimetic robotic systems excel at the specific application they are designed for, often to interact or navigate unstructured environments safely. However, redeployment to new purposes requires substantial resources, from redesign to revalidation. Despite most pneumatic artificial muscles surpassing the power and contraction performance of natural muscles, natural muscles largely remain unmatched in terms of their versatility and complex performance. This is likely due to artificial muscle's low effective strain and high radial expansion, limiting parallel operating efficiencies. To address these challenges, a class of compact versatile pneumatic actuators, called multilayer artificial muscle (MAM), that are capable of deployment to different applications through configurable modularity, is presented. The MAMs are biomimetically inspired by the sarcomere, the building block for natural muscle architecture. Similarly, MAM can extend and contract as well as be rearranged to mimic muscle-like actions and functions, such as a caterpillar locomotion robot and an entire robotic arm. The MAMs are fabricated through multilayer, multimaterial, low-cost additive manufacturing, which offers certain advantages such as higher extension, contraction force, and durability. MAMs have the potential to provide a crucial fundamental building block toward future versatile reconfigurable architecture.

AB Self-reflection practice in coaching can help with time management by promoting self-awareness. Through this process, a coach can identify habits, tendencies and behaviours that may be causing distraction or make them less productive. This insight can be used to make changes in behaviour and establish new habits that promote effective use of time. This can also help the coach to prioritise goals and create a clear roadmap. An AI powered system has been proposed that maps the conversion onto topics and relations that could help the coach with note-taking and progress identification throughout the session. This system enables the coach to actively self-reflect on time management and make sure the conversation follows the target framework. This will help the coach to better understand the goal setting, breakthrough moment, and client accountability. The proposed end-to-end system is capable of identifying coaching segments (Goal, Option, Reality, and Way forward) across a session with 85% accuracy. Experimental evaluation has also been conducted on the coaching dataset which includes over 1k one-to-one English coaching sessions. In regards to the novelty, there are no datasets of such nor study of this kind to enable self-reflection actively and evaluate in-session performance of the coach.

AB The real-time tracking process of dim targets in space is mainly achieved through the correlation and prediction of dots after the detection and calculation process. The on-board calculation of the tracking needs to be completed in milliseconds, and it needs to reach the microsecond level at high frame rates. For real-time tracking of dim targets in space, it is necessary to achieve universal tracking calculation acceleration in response to different space regions and complex backgrounds, which poses high requirements for engineering implementation architecture. This paper designs a Kalman filter calculation based on digital logic parallel acceleration architecture for real-time solution of dim target tracking on-board. A unified architecture of Vector Processing Element (VPE) was established for the calculation of Kalman filtering matrix, and an array computing structure based on VPE was designed to decompose the entire filtering process and form a parallel pipelined data stream. The prediction errors under different fixed point bit widths were analyzed and deduced, and the guidance methods for selecting the optimal bit width based on the statistical results were provided. The entire design was engineered based on Xilinx's XC7K325T, resulting in an energy efficiency improvement compared to previous designs. The single iteration calculation time does not exceed 0.7 microseconds, which can meet the current high frame rate target tracking requirements. The effectiveness of this design has been verified through simulation of random trajectory data, which is consistent with the theoretical calculation error.

Based on this research, an important layer with strong spreaders is a layer positioned in a well-connected neighborhood with more active edges, active critical nodes, the ratio of active nodes and their connections to all possible connections, and the intersection of intralayer communication compared to other layers. In this paper, we have formulated a layer weighting method based on mentioned layer's parameters and proposed an algorithm for mapping and computing the rank of nodes based on their spreading capability in multiplex networks. Thus, the result of layer weighting is used in mapping and compressing centrality vector values to a scalar value for calculating the centrality of nodes in multiplex networks by a coupled set of equations. In addition, based on this new method, the important layer parameters are combined for the first time to utilize in computing the influence of nodes from different layers. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks show that the proposed layer weighting and mapping method significantly is effective in detecting high influential spreaders against compared methods. These results validate the specific attention to suitable layer weighting measure for identifying potential spreaders in multiplex network.

AB A monocular vehicle speed detection method based on improved YOLOX and DeepSORT is proposed for the simple scene of fixed shooting angle without high precision but requiring control cost. For continuous video frames collected from a monocular fixed perspective, the vehicle is first identified by using the YOLOX object detection network improved by ELAN module and the CAENet attention mechanism constructed by CA attention and ECANet. Then, the DeepSORT target tracking algorithm is used to match the recognition results of the object detection network output in the before and after frames to find the same target in different frames. Finally, a coordinate system transformation algorithm is used to convert the position distance of the target moving in different frame images into the actual ground plane distance and divide it by the detection interval time to obtain the vehicle speed. The experimental results show that our improved object detection model can increase mAP by 2% to 4% compared with YOLOX in different versions. Compared with the original model, the target tracking using the improved YOLOX is improved by 4.3% on MOTA. The speed limiting precision of speed detection is 75% in the corresponding speed range in experimental testing site 1 and the mean error of the effective velocity value measured by our speed measurement method is 2.10 km/h in experimental testing site 2, which is better than the mean error of 5.46 km/h obtained by the radar pistol velocimeter. This detection method enables economical and efficient vehicle speed detection in simple scenes.

AB Amyloid positivity is an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease and is necessary to determine the disease. In this study, a deep generative model is utilized to predict the amyloid positivity of cognitively normal individuals using proxy measures, such as structural MRI scans, demographic variables, and cognitive scores, instead of invasive direct measurements. Through its remarkable efficacy in handling imperfect datasets caused by missing data or labels, and imbalanced classes, the model outperforms previous studies and widely used machine learning approaches with an AUROC of 0.8609. Furthermore, this study illuminates the model's adaptability to diverse clinical scenarios, even when feature sets or diagnostic criteria differ from the training data. We identify the brain regions and variables that contribute most to classification, including the lateral occipital lobes, posterior temporal lobe, and APOE epsilon 4 allele. Taking advantage of deep generative models, our approach can not only provide inexpensive, non-invasive, and accurate diagnostics for preclinical Alzheimer's disease, but also meet real-world requirements for clinical translation of a deep learning model, including transferability and interpretability.

ID MODEL
AB While vision transformers have been highly successful in improving the performance in image-based tasks, not much work has been reported on applying transformers to scene text recognition due to the complexities in the visual appearance of multi-scale texts. To fill the gap, this paper proposes an adaptive n-gram transformer for multi-scale scene text recognition (ANT-STR). In ANT-STR, an adaptive n-gram embedding that is able to automatically determine the optimal size of each image patch is designed to fully explore the potential semantic correlations between neighboring visual patches, which is essential for feature extraction from multi-scale scene texts. On top of the adaptive n-gram embedding, a patch-based n-gram attention mechanism is introduced into ANT-STR to further process the feature maps for multi-scale texts. In addition, the loss function is rectified to take into account both multi-scale character-based identification and contextual coherence scoring. Comparative studies are conducted on five widely used benchmark datasets and a new multi-scale scene text dataset collected from tourism scenes in Indonesia. Our experimental results demonstrate that ANT-STR performs considerably better compared to the state-of-the-art, especially in handling complex multi-scale scene texts.

TI Improved prediction of behavioral and neural similarity spaces using
   pruned DNNs
SO NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Article
DE Pruning; Representational-similarity; Similarity; DNNs
AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become an important tool for modeling brain and behavior. One key area of interest has been to apply these networks to model human similarity judgements. Several previous works have used the embeddings from the penultimate layer of vision DNNs and showed that a reweighting of these features improves the fit between human similarity judgments and DNNs. These studies underline the idea that these embeddings form a good basis set but lack the correct level of salience. Here we re-examined the grounds for this idea and on the contrary, we hypothesized that these embeddings, beyond forming a good basis set, also have the correct level of salience to account for similarity judgments. It is just that the huge dimensional embedding needs to be pruned to select those features relevant for the considered domain for which a similarity space is modeled. In Study 1 we supervised DNN pruning based on a subset of human similarity judgments. We found that pruning: i) improved out-of-sample prediction of human similarity judgments from DNN embeddings, ii) produced better alignment with WordNet hierarchy, and iii) retained much higher classification accuracy than reweighting. Study 2 showed that pruning by neurobiological data is highly effective in improving out-of-sample prediction of brain-derived representational dissimilarity matrices from DNN embeddings, at times fleshing out isomorphisms not otherwise observable. Using pruned DNNs, image-level heatmaps can be produced to identify image sections whose features load on dimensions coded by a brain area. Pruning supervised by human brain/behavior therefore effectively identifies alignable dimensions of knowledge between DNNs and humans and constitutes an effective method for understanding the organization of knowledge in neural networks.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB For Deep Neural Networks (DNN), the standard gradient-based algorithms may not be efficient because of the raised computational expense resulting from the increase in the number of layers. This paper offers an alternative to the classic training solutions: an in-depth study to find conditions under which the underlying Artificial Neural Networks ANN minimisation problem can be addressed from a Dynamic Programming (DP) perspective. Specifically, we prove that any ANN with monotonic activation is separable when regarded as a parametric function. Particularly, when the ANN is viewed as a network representation of a dynamical system (as a coupled cell network), we also prove that the transmission-of-signal law is separable provided the activation function is a monotone non-decreasing function. This strategy may have a positive impact on the performance of ANNs by improving their learning accuracy, particularly for DNNs. For our purposes, ANNs are also viewed as universal approximators of continuous functions and as abstract compositions of an even number of functions. This broader representation makes it easier to analyse them from many other perspectives (universal approximation issues, inverse problem solving) leading to a general improvement in knowledge on NNs and their performance.

AB The progress in technology has led to an increase in the amount of data that can be generated and processed. Downsampling methods are employed to eliminate unnecessary data but can also lead to the loss of valuable information. Herein, we designed a pooling algorithm, Conditional-Pooling, that provides a transitive structure composed of average (avg.) and max-pooling methods, and it hosts the advantageous behaviors from both. We examined our approach on several image recognition and detection tasks using deep neural networks. The results reveal that our method excels over major rivals like max-pooling and avg. pooling when tested on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR for classification, Pascal VOC for detection, COCO minitrains, and ADORESet for both classification and detection. The output of Conditional-Pooling preserves important image features such as edges and corners and contains more salient features that lead to more accurate results. The code for Conditional-Pooling will be available at https://github.com/bayraktare/conditional_pooling.

AB In recent years, the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) has achieved remarkable results. How-ever, the limited label samples are still a major challenge when using CNN and GCN to classify hyperspectral images. In order to alleviate this problem, a double branch fusion network of CNN and enhanced graph attention network (CEGAT) based on key sample selection strategy is proposed. First, a linear discrimination of spectral inter-class slices (LD_SICS) module is designed to eliminate spectral redundancy of HSIs. Then, a spatial spectral correlation attention (SSCA) module is proposed, which can extract and assign attention weight to the spatial and spectral correlation features. On the graph attention (GAT) branch, the HSI is segmented into some super pixels as input to reduce the amount of network parameters. In addition, an enhanced graph attention (EGAT) module is constructed to enhance the relationship between nodes. Finally, a key sample selection (KSS) strategy is proposed to enable the network to achieve better classification performance with few labeled samples. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, CEGAT has better classification performance under limited label samples.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Given the visual data of an object, directly predicting the high-degree-of-freedom grasping pose of a dexterous hand is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new grasp synthesis framework based on hand-object interaction for representing the grasping pose of a high degree of freedom hand. First, the attention operation embedded in the finger encoder guides the contact of each finger with the object to obtain the initial grasp pose; then, based on the hand-object interaction constraints, the pose is further optimized in the finger refinement module. The experimental results show that our model enables the robot to grasp objects stably.

AB This paper proposes a novel strategy for lightweight 3D hand pose estimation. The strategy decomposes the estimation process into feature extraction and feature exploitation, where feature extraction performs dimension reduction on the original input and outputs feature vectors. Feature exploitation is further analyzed and considered as a path optimization problem, and reinforcement learning (RL) is proved to be capable of tackling the problem accurately. A framework cascading convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and RL is next introduced to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, where two different backbones are used to extract features, and RL is extended into continuous space to enhance accuracy. Ablation studies and experiments are carried out on NYU and ICVL datasets using the proposed strategy with continuous RL. The results show that the accuracy of continuous RL exceeds discrete RL, and the rapidity and accuracy leads the backbones. Comparative studies show the strategy achieves leading rapidity and accuracy in single-view depth-based methods.

AB When solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems, the balance of convergence, diversity, and feasibility plays a pivotal role. To address this issue, this paper proposes a coevolutionary constrained multi-objective algorithm with learning constraint boundary (CCMOLCB). Firstly, the constrained multi-objective problems are transformed by adding an additional objective using the constraint violation degree. Then, the transformed problem is solved by an improved coevolutionary framework which employs two populations. The main population explores the objective space and repairs infeasible solutions to maintain the feasibility of population. Meanwhile, the feasibility and diversity of solutions are balanced by using a dynamic weight coefficient during the evolution, it changes as the number of iterations increases. The subordinate population selects solutions by taking into consideration the learning constraint boundary (LCB). This boundary guarantees convergence of solutions by constraining the search range of the main population, thereby enhancing the environmental selection pressure. The performance of CCMOLCB is compared with seven state-of-the-art constrained multi-objective evolutionary algorithms on five test suites. The experimental results illustrate that CCMOLCB exhibits competitive performance when dealing with this family of problems. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate measurement of blood flow velocity is important for the prevention and early diagnosis of atherosclerosis. However, due to the uncertainty of parameter settings, the autocorrelation velocimetry methods based on clutter filtering are prone to incorrectly filter out the near-wall blood flow signal, resulting in poor velocimetric accuracy. In addition, the Doppler coherent compounding acts as a low-pass filter, which also leads to low values of blood flow velocity estimated by the above methods. Motivated by this status quo, here we propose a deep learning estimator that combines clutter filtering and blood flow velocimetry based on the adaptive property of one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN). The estimator is operated by first extracting the blood flow signal from the original Doppler echo signal through an affine transformation of the 1D convolution, and then converting the extracted signal into the desired blood flow velocity using a linear transformation function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation as well as in vivo carotid artery data. Compared with typical velocimetry methods such as high-pass filtering (HPF) and singular value decomposition (SVD), the results show that the normalized root means square error (NRMSE) obtained by 1DCNN is reduced by 54.99 % and 53.50 % for forward blood flow velocimetry, and 70.99 % and 69.50 % for reverse blood flow velocimetry, respectively. Consistently, the in vivo measurements demonstrate that the goodness-of-fit of the proposed estimator is improved by 8.72 % and 4.74 % for five subjects. Moreover, the estimation time consumed by 1DCNN is greatly reduced, which costs only 2.91 % of the time of HPF and 12.83 % of the time of SVD. In conclusion, the proposed estimator is a better alternative to the current blood flow velocimetry, and is capable of providing more accurate diagnosis information for vascular diseases in clinical applications.

AB This paper makes a new breakthrough in deliberating the bifurcations of fractional-order bidirectional associative memory neural network (FOBAMNN). In the beginning, the corresponding bifurcation results are established according to self-regulating parameter, which is different from bifurcation outcomes available by using time delay as the bifurcation parameter, and greatly enriches the bifurcation results of continuous neural networks(NNs). The deived results manifest that a larger self-regulating parameter is more conducive to the stability of the system, which is consistent with the actual meaning of the self-regulating parameter representing the decay rate of activity. In addition to the innovation in the research object, this paper also has innovation in the procedure of calculating the bifurcation critical point. In the face of the quartic equation about the bifurcation parameters, this paper utilizes the methodology of implicit array to calculate the bifurcation critical point succinctly and effectively, which eschews the disadvantages of the conventional Ferrari approach, such as cumbersome formula and huge computational efforts. Our developed technique can be employed as a general method to solve the bifurcation point including the problem of dealing with the bifurcation critical point of delay. Ultimately, numerical experiments test the key theoretical fruits of this paper.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Computing with Words (CWW) is a remarkable approach that enables human beings to interact with computing machines using linguistic information. Recently, there have been various contributions in the realm of CWW methodologies (both theoretical and application oriented). However, very less work exists on the provision of software libraries of these methodologies to the interested users/ researchers, and where available are mostly on proprietary platforms like MATLAB, to the best of our knowledge. As, python has recently emerged as a versatile programming language with its application in various domains, hence, we have also developed the python based implementations for numerous CWW methodologies.

ID DESIGN; FRAMEWORK
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been a pivotal technology in a myriad of fields, boasting remarkable achievements. Nevertheless, their substantial workload and inherent redundancies pose ongoing challenges for both practitioners and academia. While numerous researchers endeavor to optimize DNNs, the inherent parallelism features of hardware are generally underutilized, resulting in inefficient use of hardware resources. To address this deficit, the paper unveils a hardware-aware mechanism, IHSOpti, which incorporates hardware characteristics with software algorithms for DNN optimization. IHSOpti endeavors to exploit the full potential of modern hardware parallelism, with significant emphasis on pipelining mechanisms. Specifically, IHSOpti for-mulates an advanced sparse training algorithm Polar_HSPG which incorporates the newly-proposed layer-wise refined polarization regularizer (LWPolar), grounded on the half-space project gradient (HSPG). Subsequently, IHSOpti pioneeringly introduces the residual strategy for optimizing the layer-level redundancies of neural networks, capitalizing on the pipelining attributes inherent in current hardware. Experimental findings demonstrate that IHSOpti attains outstanding pruning ratios in both parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, IHSOpti achieves up to 96.90% and 82.73% pruning ratios with the accuracy of 93.34% for VGGBN, 97.69% and 95.24% pruning ratios with the accuracy of 94.69% for ResNet, 98.07% and 97.80% pruning ratios with the accuracy of 95.73% for the cutting-edge network RegNet, respectively. Notably, the running efficiency exhibits remarkable improvements with accelerations ranging from 3.63x to 8.20x for CPUs and 1.22x to 2.25x for GPUs, respectively. These outcomes surpass the latest advances in the field. Through the incorporation of specific hardware characteristics, IHSOpti provides a comprehensive and effective approach to harness the intrinsic parallelism of contemporary hardware platforms for DNNs.

AB Identifying the relationship between imaging features and genetic variation (a term coined"imaging genomics") offers valuable insight into the pathogenesis of cancer, as well as cognitive and psychiatric disorders. However, how to integrate-omics and imaging data in a biologically meaningful approach to both provide pathobiological underpinning and achieve clinical applications remain challenging. In this review, we aim to discuss the difficulties in combining different sources of data and explaining the genotype-phenotype association, and we attempt to discuss the potential applications of imaging genomics in several (patho)physiological questions to better understand human physiology and disease. Future efforts on deciphering the genotype-phenotype landscapes by interpretable imaging genomics analyses are needed to provide new insights into molecular biology and molecular medicine.

AB Although the high number of bands in hyperspectral remote sensing images increases their usefulness, it also causes some processing difficulty. In supervised classification, one problem is decreasing classification accuracy due to the insufficient training samples against the bands. A way to deal with this problem is the selection of appropriate bands by the metaheuristic methods. Because of the stochastic search, the selected bands differ in any implementation of a metaheuristic method. So, the results obtained from the classification of these different band subsets will also have some differences. In this study, a fusion-based approach has been proposed to improve the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images by multiple implementations of a metaheuristic method for band selection. We have tested the proposed method using ten metaheuristic methods with different objective functions on four well-known datasets. The results show the proposed fusion-based approach successfully improves the classification accuracy in all experiments. The accuracy improvement varies depending on the metaheuristic method, the objective function, and the dataset and ranges from 0.4% to 15.7%. The proposed method improves the classification of complex datasets more and affects weaker objective functions considerably. The results also show the proposed method brings the accuracy of different metaheuristic methods close to each other and reduces the sensitivity of selecting the proper ones. Thus, an automated classification system can be obtained using a parameter-less method. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has become an essential approach in the early detection of health issues. One of the significant benefits of this approach is high accuracy and low computational complexity without sacrificing model performance. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with seizure detection are one of the critical areas where CAD systems have been developed. In this study, we proposed a CAD system for seizure detection that prioritizes optimizing the solution's complexity. The proposed approach combines geometry invariants multi-channel fusion and amplitude normalization for input data preparation, and experiments on the frequency domain and CNN architecture for reducing complexity. Furthermore, the study includes explainability experiments that should aim to interpret not only the performance of the model but also the analysis of the patterns that contributed to the obtained results. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its suitability for decision support in both clinical and home environments.

ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK
AB Networks are now more crucial than ever for modeling complex systems with interconnected components. Many methods have been developed to infer unobserved links or predict latent links based on observed network topology. However, the effectiveness of current methods is often limited due to the nature of sparseness in large-scale networks. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is one of the most popular low -rank approximation methods which has been successfully applied to large-scale data. However, maintaining generalization from limited observations is still an open challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel link prediction method based on adversarial NMF, which reconstructs a sparse network by an efficient adversarial training algorithm. Unlike the conventional NMF methods, our model considers potential test adversaries beyond the pre-defined bounds and provides a robust reconstruction with good generalization power. Besides, to preserve the local structure of a network, we use the common neighbor algorithm to extract the node similarity and apply it to low-dimensional latent representation. Simultaneously, we use Frobenius-norm regularization to prevent the factorization from overfitting. We provide an effective Majorization-Minimization method to learn the model parameters. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, as shown by extensive experiment results on twelve real-world datasets.

DE Lightweight channel attention; Direct interaction; Object detection;
   Semantic segmentation
AB The widely used convolutional attention blocks (e.g., Squeeze-and-Excitation attention, Coordinate attention) all use an indirect convolution layer for modeling between channels, lacking direct interaction. In this article, we present a lightweight channel attention mechanism, partial channel pooling attention (PPA), for handling object detection and segmentation tasks. While minimizing the redundancy of channels and pixels, complementary information is achieved through direct interaction between channels. Specifically, we pool the feature maps into pooling modules (pooling blocks) of size KxK. Each pixel after pooling is considered a feature of each channel. In this way, our attention mechanism (PPA) is lightweight and can be directly embedded into existing networks. Our channel attention module selectively emphasizes interdependent channel mappings through the direct interaction of information between channels rather than indirectly through convolutional layers. Through extensive experiments in object detection and semantic segmentation, our PPA performs better on various types of base models. For instance, adding PPA achieves training throughput comparable to adding Coordinate attention but has twice the improvement effect of adding Coordinate attention in COCO detection and semantic segmentation.

ID ALGORITHMS; STABILITY
AB Qualitative Constraint Networks (QCNs) comprise a Symbolic AI framework for representing and reasoning about spatial and temporal information via the use of natural disjunctive qualitative relations, e.g., a constraint can be of the form "Task A is scheduled after or during Task C". In qualitative constraint-based reasoning, the state-of-the-art approach to tackle a given QCN consists in employing a backtracking algorithm, where the branching decisions during search and the refinement of the QCN are governed by certain heuristics that have been proposed in the literature. Although there has been plenty of research on how these heuristics compare and behave in terms of checking the satisfiability of a QCN fast, to the best of our knowledge there has not been any study on how they compare and behave in terms of obtaining a tractable refinement of a QCN that is also robust. In brief, a robust refinement of a QCN can be primarily seen as one that retains as many qualitative solutions as possible, e.g., the configuration "Task A is scheduled after or during Task C" is more robust than "Task A is scheduled after TaskC". Here, wemake such a preliminary comparison and evaluation with respect to prominent heuristics in the literature, and reveal that there exists a trade-off between fast and robust solving of QCNs for datasets consisting of instances of Allen's Interval Algebra and Region Connection Calculus. Furthermore, we investigate reasons for the existence of this trade-off and find that more aggressive heuristics are more efficient at the cost of producing less robust refinements.

AB As an important part of the operation preparation process of the intelligent transportation system, the passenger flow distribution law and forecast can guide the urban rail transit to formulate a reasonable operation scheduling plan. Due to the complexity, multi-variables, and instability of traffic passenger flow data, accurate passenger flow prediction takes a lot of work. Based on a convolutional neural network, a causal convolution self-attention traffic passenger flow prediction model MTS-Informer framework is proposed. This method follows the changing law of auxiliary variables, adopts the stabilization method to reduce the instability of the original sequence, and uses the causal convolution feature to improve the ability of the model's self-attention mechanism to extract local information from the input sequence. The weakening effect of the self-attention mechanism ensures that it can learn similarly to the differential features in the original sequence data. In addition, the stationarity detection of the original sequence data is added. The experimental results show that the fitting degree of the sample data is significantly improved, and the standard error decreases between 10 and 40%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed modeling technique. It has higher prediction accuracy and operating efficiency and can provide a basis for urban traffic passenger flow prediction.

AB The world has seen a ground-breaking development in the utilization of digital images and their applications in modern society. Practically, digital images which are captured in hazy weather and the variable smoke concentration in the industrial scene cause blurring in the observed digital images. In this paper, a smoke removal algorithm based on dark channel prior (DCP) which study the issue of medium transmission inaccuracy is proposed. According to the traditional DCP, atmospheric light in the entire digital image as a global constant and suggested by DCP is further enhanced by utilizing second-generation wavelets filter (SGWs) and as a result, more accurate model is achieved. Consequently, the SGWs filtering is used to improve the solution of atmospheric light and combining the concentration evaluation to obtain the weight of smoke. The proposed algorithm is evaluated against several state-of- the-art smoke removal methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method restores clear images with richer details and more natural colors for smoke free images in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR, the structural similarity index SSIM and the average gradient assessments. Moreover, the execution efficiency of the proposed algorithm is compared with several smoke removal methods where the proposed method has very low computational latency and increased slowly with the improvement of image resolution.

ID TESTING FUZZY HYPOTHESES; BOOTSTRAP TECHNIQUES
AB Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about underlying population(s) using sample data to either confirm or falsify hypotheses. However, the complexity of real-life problems often makes the underlying statistical models inadequate, as information is often imprecise in many respects. To address this common problem, some papers have been published on modifications and extensions of test concepts by employing tools of fuzzy statistics. In this paper, we present a non-parametric test for the difference between quantiles of two independent populations based on fuzzy random variables. For this purpose, we consider the fuzzy quantile function and its estimation based on alpha-values of fuzzy random variables. We then provide a fuzzy test based on the fuzzy empirical distribution function for the difference of fuzzy order statistics from these independent populations. We also suggest a specific degree-based criterion to compare the fuzzy test statistics at a specific significance level to decide whether the underlying fuzzy null hypothesis can be rejected or not. The effectiveness of the proposed two-sample test on quantiles is investigated via numerical examples.

AB In recent years, China's rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology have positioned it as a global leader in information processing, intelligent chip development, and deep learning technologies. The pervasive impact of AI has led to transformative shifts in various domains of life, with its integration across industries substantially enhancing overall production efficiency. Particularly evident in product design, the infusion of AI technology has catalyzed significant productivity improvements. This research investigates the amalgamation of Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) within the framework of AI technology to establish a robust product design system. The system aims to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of design processes by leveraging the complementary strengths of GA and PSO. This integration has propelled product design into accelerated evolution and modernization. The study delves into AI's application of deep neural networks in product design within the context of the digital age. Artificial intelligence technology is used in product design in the context of the Internet. First, the concept of AI technology is briefly introduced, and DNN algorithms are described in detail, including the PSO and Genetic Algorithms. Second, the product design and development process based on artificial intelligence technology, design guidelines, and technical features are mainly described. Finally, using the seat as the research object, the application effect of artificial intelligence technology in product design is analyzed, and 10 subjective evaluation questions are set to experiment. Regarding material texture, the highest score for the B3 Barcelona chair is 4.3. Users prefer leather seats with diverse materials, and the score for painted wood materials is lower. From the product structure and shape analysis, the highest score is the B3 Barcelona chair, which has a value of 4.1, and the lowest score is the B1 red and blue chair, which has a value of 3.0. Based on this result, users like arc and curve shape much more than straight structures.

AB These days, exploring information retrieval models is one of the most essential aspects of English sentence retrieval research. These models are driven by diverse retrieval mechanisms that offer varying similarity calculations and directly influence the final result ranking. However, despite decades of work due to technical constraints, deep semantic analysis has been challenging. This gap emphasizes the importance of a precise semantic understanding of information acquisition through learning approaches. Based on the above opening, this paper establishes a fast retrieval model of English sentences based on the statistical language model (SLM). First, the proposed method utilizes SLM to extract significant feature words from the corpus. These feature words are identified by analyzing co-occurrence patterns and frequency distributions within the standard. Second, it employs the N-gram model to calculate the probabilities of word occurrences based on their contextual dependencies. This framework represents feature words and their associated probabilities in a structured manner by capturing the intricate nuances of language semantics. Third, the model integrates ontology to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding by enabling the mapping natural language expressions to conceptual entities. Finally, the suggested model retrieves English sentences through semantic matching by leveraging the comprehensive semantic framework and ontology-based search. The experimental study revealed that the proposed model demonstrated an impressive retrieval ratio of 98.5% by outperforming existing models in the comparison. Moreover, these results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, and the accuracy of this algorithm is improved by 7.52% compared with TF-IDF. When the labelled corpus is very small and the unlabeled corpus is relatively large, the algorithm enhances the classifier's performance by 12.6%. This shows that the algorithm used in this paper reduces the influence of the synonym processing stage on the overall performance while retaining the advantages of high precision and accuracy of calculation results.

AB A novel fully connected recurrent neural network (FCRNN) structure is proposed for the identification of unknown dynamics of nonlinear systems. The proposed recurrent structure consists of internal feedback layers of adjustable weights which impart necessary memory property to the structure and improves its ability in handling the dynamical systems. The back-propagation algorithm (BP) is used to derive the weight update equations of the proposed model. The convergence of the proposed approach is proven in the sense of Lyapunov-stability analysis. A total of three examples are considered and the performance of the proposed structure is evaluated by comparing it with the results obtained from other popular neural network models such as feed-forward neural network (FFNN), Elman neural network (ENN), Jordan neural network (JNN), and the locally recurrent neural networks (LRNN). Experimental results obtained show that the FCRNN model has outperformed the other neural models in terms of identification accuracy and robustness.

AB Unsupervised domain adaptation addresses the problem that model trained on labeled source domains can be transferred to unlabeled target domains, which crucially involves aligning the data distributions in the source and target domains by learning new feature representations. Current methods mostly focus on transferring knowledge from a single source domain to a single target domain, whereas researchers attempt to adapt to multiple similar target domains in many application scenarios. We propose progressive adversarial learning for solving single-source multi-target domain adaptation. Specifically, the model aligns every pair of source and target domains by self-training, obtains high-confidence pseudo labels, and constructs pseudo source domains accordingly. Next, each pseudo source domain and the remaining target domains subspace are efficiently aligned by combining adversarial and self-training methods to obtain additional structured source knowledge to derive the domain-invariant and discriminative representations. Experimental results on three challenging publicly available datasets show better performance than other domain adaptation methods.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Mechanical search; RF-visual perception; RF-visual fusion; RFID; Robotic
   grasping
AB Mechanical search is a robotic problem where a robot needs to retrieve a target item that is partially or fully-occluded from its camera. State-of-the-art approaches for mechanical search either require an expensive search process to find the target item, or they require the item to be tagged with a radio frequency identification tag (e.g., RFID), making their approach beneficial only to tagged items in the environment. We present FuseBot, the first robotic system for RF-Visual mechanical search that enables efficient retrieval of both RF-tagged and untagged items in a pile. Rather than requiring all target items in a pile to be RF-tagged, FuseBot leverages the mere existence of an RF-tagged item in the pile to benefit both tagged and untagged items. Our design introduces two key innovations. The first is RF-Visual Mapping, a technique that identifies and locates RF-tagged items in a pile and uses this information to construct an RF-Visual occupancy distribution map. The second is RF-Visual Extraction, a policy formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the number of actions required to extract the target object by accounting for the probabilistic occupancy distribution, the expected grasp quality, and the expected information gain from future actions. We built a real-time end-to-end prototype of our system on a UR5e robotic arm with in-hand vision and RF perception modules. We conducted over 200 real-world experimental trials to evaluate FuseBot and compare its performance to a state-of-the-art vision-based system named X-Ray (Danielczuk et al., in: 2020 IEEE/RSJ international conference on intelligent robots and systems (IROS), IEEE, 2020). Our experimental results demonstrate that FuseBot outperforms X-Ray's efficiency by more than 40% in terms of the number of actions required for successful mechanical search. Furthermore, in comparison to X-Ray's success rate of 84%, FuseBot achieves a success rate of 95% in retrieving untagged items, demonstrating for the first time that the benefits of RF perception extend beyond tagged objects in the mechanical search problem.

AB Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success in various applications. However, training dedicated GNNs for small-scale graphs still faces many problems such as over-fitting and deficiencies in performance improvements. Traditional methods such as data augmentation are commonly used in computer vision (CV) but are barely applied to graph structure data to solve these problems. In this paper, we propose a training framework named MTDA (Multi-Task learning with Data Augmentation)-GNN, which combines data augmentation and multi-task learning to improve the node classification performance of GNN on small-scale graph data. First, we use Graph Auto-Encoders (GAE) as a link predictor, modifying the original graphs' topological structure by promoting intra-class edges and demoting interclass edges, in this way to denoise the original graph and realize data augmentation. Then the modified graph is used as the input of the node classification model. Besides defining the node pair classification as an auxiliary task, we introduce multi-task learning during the training process, forcing the predicted labels to conform to the observed pairwise relationships and improving the model's classification ability. In addition, we conduct an adaptive dynamic weighting strategy to distribute the weight of different tasks automatically. Experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed MTDA-GNN outperforms traditional GNNs in graph-based semi-supervised node classification.

ID U-NET
AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a prominent model in medical image segmentation, achieving remarkable advancements in clinical practice. Despite the promising results reported in the literature, the effectiveness of DNNs necessitates substantial quantities of high-quality annotated training data. During experiments, we observe a significant decline in the performance of DNNs on the test set when there exists disruption in the labels of the training dataset, revealing inherent limitations in the robustness of DNNs. In this paper, we find that the neural memory ordinary differential equation (nmODE), a recently proposed model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), not only addresses the robustness limitation but also enhances performance when trained by the clean training dataset. However, it is acknowledged that the ODE-based model tends to be less computationally efficient compared to the conventional discrete models due to the multiple function evaluations required by the ODE solver. Recognizing the efficiency limitation of the ODE-based model, we propose a novel approach called the nmODE-based knowledge distillation (nmODE-KD). The proposed method aims to transfer knowledge from the continuous nmODE to a discrete layer, simultaneously enhancing the model's robustness and efficiency. The core concept of nmODE-KD revolves around enforcing the discrete layer to mimic the continuous nmODE by minimizing the KL divergence between them. Experimental results on 18 organs-at-risk segmentation tasks demonstrate that nmODE-KD exhibits improved robustness compared to ODE-based models while also mitigating the efficiency limitation.

AB Classification task is complicated by several facts including skewed class proportion and unclear decision regions due to noise, class overlap, small disjunct, caused by large within-class variation. These issues make data classification difficult, reducing overall performance, and challenging to draw meaningful insights. In this research, the evidence-based adaptive oversampling algorithm (EVA-oversampling) based on Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is developed for imbalance classification. This technique involves assigning probability regarding class belonging for each instance to represent uncertainty that each data point may hold. Synthetic data points are generated to make up for the under-representation of minority instances on the region with high confidence, thereby strengthening theminority class region. The experiments revealed that the proposed method worked effectively even in situations where imbalanced counts and data complexity would normally pose significant obstacles. This approach performs better than SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN, MWMOTE, KMeansSMOTE, LoRAS, and SyMProD algorithms in terms of F-1-measure and G-mean for highly imbalanced data while maintaining the overall performance.

AB Domain adaptation in neural machine translation (NMT) tasks often involves working with datasets that have a different distribution from the training data. In such scenarios, k-nearest-neighbor machine translation (kNN-MT) has been shown to be effective in retrieving relevant information from large datastores. However, the high-dimensional context vectors of large neural machine translation model result in high computational costs for distance computation and storage. To address this issue, index optimization techniques have been proposed, including the use of inverted file index (IVF) and product vector quantization (PQ), called IVFPQ. In this paper, we explore the recent index techniques for efficient machine translation domain adaptation and combine multiple index structures to improve the efficiency of nearest-neighbor search in domain adaptation datasets for machine translation task. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness when combining optimized product quantization (OPQ) and hierarchical navigable small-world (HNSW) indexing with IVFPQ. Our study aims to provide insights into the most suitable composite index methods for efficient nearest-neighbor search in domain adaptation datasets, with a focus on improving both accuracy and speed.

TI Feature augmentation and scale penalty for tiny floating detection

AB Rapidly increasing concerns about the impact of tiny floating objects on water health has prompted the need for more effective detection methods. The main challenge in detecting these objects is their small size, accounting for only 0.5% of the image, which significantly hampers detection efforts. Moreover, existing object detectors utilize the intersection over union (IOU) as the bounding box regression loss to enhance object localization accuracy. However, this approach penalizes larger objects more heavily than smaller ones, leading to imbalanced regression losses. To address these issues, we propose enhancements to the YOLOv4 model. Our approach incorporates the following key improvements. Firstly, we introduce a feature augmentation module (FAM) to capture multi-scale contextual features of tiny objects and low-level features. This helps overcome the challenge of limited representation of tiny objects in the deeper layers of the network. Additionally, we integrate a convolutional block attention module (CBAM) into the path aggregation network to prevent the flooding of conflicting information in the fusion of features at different levels, ensuring an accurate representation of tiny object features. Finally, we propose a scale penalty function to address the issue of imbalanced regression loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our improved model achieves impressive detection performance on the Flow-RI dataset, specifically for detecting small-scale objects. These findings highlight the efficacy of our proposed methodology in enhancing the detection of tiny floating objects and contribute to the overall goal of improving water health.

ID TRAITS
AB Emotion detection from text is a relatively new sub-field of artificial intelligence closely related to Sentiment Analysis (SA). SA detects positive, neutral, or negative emotions in text. In contrast, emotion analysis detects and distinguishes certain types of emotions expressed in textbooks, such as disgust, fear, anger, happiness, surprise and sadness. Meanwhile, personality is a critical psychological concept that accounts for unique characteristics. Identifying and validating an individual's personality efficiently and reliably is an admirable goal. This article aims to present a simultaneous review of Emotion and Personality detection from texts and elaborates upon approaches in developing text-based Emotion and Personality detection systems. The studies' essential contributions, methodologies, datasets, conclusions drawn, strengths, and limitations are also explored. Additionally, this article discusses some of the field's state-of-the-art ideas. In conclusion, the study delves into specific challenges and possible future research directions for detecting emotions and personalities from the text.

TI A middleware for providing communicability to Embedded MAS based on the

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
LA English

DE Embedded multi-agent systems; Embedded systems; Communication protocol
ID AGENTS
AB An Embedded multi-agent system (Embedded MAS) is an embedded cognitive system based on agents cooperating to control hardware devices. These agents are autonomous and proactive entities capable of decision-making and can constantly acquire new knowledge via interaction with other agents and the environment. Since the interaction between agents is relevant for acquiring new knowledge, issues such as the communicability and mobility of agents from different Embedded MAS must be highlighted. The classification of a MAS as Open or Closed only considers the mobility of agents, but communicability also needs to be considered. For this, we extend the notion of openness in these systems to consider the existence of Totally Closed and Limited Open MAS, to consider agents from an Embedded MAS without the ability to move or communicate or when they lose the ability to communicate but still can move to other systems. In cooperative missions where several devices adopt Embedded MAS, they should not become totally closed since they lose the ability to cooperate and could put the mission at risk. Some existent works considering Embedded MAS relies upon IoT infrastructures to guarantee communicability and mobility. But, in cases where these infrastructures are temporarily or permanently unavailable, the system becomes totally closed. Even when alternatives exist, they do not use cryptography. Therefore, we present a middleware for supporting the development of Embedded MAS, considering radiofrequency ad-hoc communication to reduce the dependency on centralized infrastructures. An extended protocol supports message exchange between devices using cryptography. We also present a proof of concept application and a formalization of our model.

DE Knowledge graph; Evolvability; Ontology; Normalized systems theory
AB Along with the ongoing digitalization of society, we witness a strong movement to make scientific data FAIR, machine-actionable, and available in the form of knowledge graphs. On the other hand, converting machine-actionable data from knowledge graphs back into human-oriented formats, including documents, graphical, or voice user interfaces, poses significant challenges. The solutions often build on various templates tailored to specific platforms on top of the shared underlying data. These templates suffer from limited reusability, making their adaptations difficult. Moreover, the continuous evolution of data or technological advancements requires substantial efforts to maintain these templates over time. In general, these challenges increase software development costs and are error-prone. In this paper, we propose a solution based on Normalized Systems Theory to address this challenge with the aim of achieving evolvability and sustainability in the transformation process of knowledge graphs into human-oriented formats with broad applicability across domains and technologies. We explain the theoretical foundation and design theorems used in our solution and outline the approach and implementation details. We theoretically evaluate our solution by comparing it to the traditional approach, where the systems are crafted manually. The evaluation shows that our solution is more efficient and effective on a large scale, reducing the human labor required to maintain various templates and supported target platforms. Next, we demonstrate the technical feasibility of our solution on a proof-of-concept implementation in a domain of data management planning that may also serve as a basis for future development.

AB Online controlled experiments, also known as A/B tests, have become ubiquitous. While many practical challenges in running experiments at scale have been thoroughly discussed, the ethical dimension of A/B testing has been neglected. This article fills this gap in the literature by introducing a new, soft ethics and governance framework that explicitly recognizes how the rise of an experimentation culture in industry settings brings not only unprecedented opportunities to businesses but also significant responsibilities. More precisely, the article (a) introduces a set of principles to encourage ethical and responsible experimentation to protect users, customers, and society; (b) argues that ensuring compliance with the proposed principles is a complex challenge unlikely to be addressed by resorting to a one-solution response; (c) discusses the relevance and effectiveness of several mechanisms and policies in educating, governing, and incentivizing companies conducting online controlled experiments; and (d) offers a list of prompting questions specifically designed to help and empower practitioners by stimulating specific ethical deliberations and facilitating coordination among different groups of stakeholders.

AB Special attention to the Agri-food closed-loop supply chain is more critical during global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The main reason for this issue is the importance of food security in different communities during various crises. On the other hand, strategic analysis helps Agri-food organizations to be more prepared to face threats and use the opportunities of these crises. Consequently, the combination of supply chain management and strategic analysis can be utilized for better planning in this situation. In the present study, the closed-loop supply chain of canned food in uncertain conditions is investigated. One of the main features of the problem is to use the canned food waste to increase profitability during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Robust Probabilistic Chance Constrained Programming (RPCCP) approach is presented to face the uncertainty of the problem. One of the main features of the approach is to determine the confidence level of the system proactively to add the concept of robustness to the problem. After using the combined approach and prioritizing strategies for the case study from an emerging economy, "Increased export share of canned food products through virtual marketing and exhibitions" was selected as the superior strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the comparison of the results with the organization's current conditions, it was found that the income from the sales of primary products and recycled products increased by 39.8% and 10.79%, respectively. Implementing this strategy indicated that the values of other essential criteria of the closed-loop supply chain also increased.

AB With the goal of solving the problem of feature extractors lacking strong supervision training and insufficient time information concerning single-sequence model learning, a hierarchical sequence memory network with a multi-level iterative optimisation strategy is proposed for continuous sign language recognition. This method uses the spatial-temporal fusion convolution network (STFC-Net) to extract the spatial-temporal information of RGB and Optical flow video frames to obtain the multi-modal visual features of a sign language video. Then, in order to enhance the temporal relationships of visual feature maps, the hierarchical memory sequence network is used to capture local utterance features and global context dependencies across time dimensions to obtain sequence features. Finally, the decoder decodes the final sentence sequence. In order to enhance the feature extractor, the authors adopted a multi-level iterative optimisation strategy to fine-tune STFC-Net and the utterance feature extractor. The experimental results on the RWTH-Phoenix-Weather multi-signer 2014 dataset and the Chinese sign language dataset show the effectiveness and superiority of this method.

AB Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent performance on hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, their robustness is threatened by carefully created adversarial examples. Therefore, adversarial defense methods have provided an effective defense strategy to protect HSI classification networks. However, most defense models are highly dependent on known types of adversarial examples, which leads to poor generalization to defend against unknown attacks. In this study, we propose an attack-invariant attention feature-based defense (AIAF-Defense) model to improve the generalization ability of the defense model. Specifically, the AIAF-Defense model has an encoder-decoder structure to remove the perturbations from the HSI adversarial examples. We design a feature-disentanglement network as the encoder structure to decouple the attack-invariant spectral-spatial feature and attack-variant feature in the adversarial example and apply a decoder structure to reconstruct the legitimate HSI example. In addition, an attention-guided reconstruction loss is proposed to address the attention-shift problem caused by perturbation and provide an attention constraint for the extraction of attack-invariant attention features. Extensive experiments are conducted on three benchmark hyperspectral image datasets, the PaviaU, HoustonU 2018, and Salinas datasets, and the obtained results show that the proposed AIAF-Defense model improves the defense ability on both known and unknown adversarial attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/AAAA-CS/AIAF_ HyperspectralAdversarialDefense.

TI Automatic Head and Neck Tumor segmentation and outcome prediction

   HECKTOR challenge

AB By focusing on metabolic and morphological tissue properties respectively, FluoroDeoxyGlucose (FDG)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Computed Tomography (CT) modalities include complementary and synergistic information for cancerous lesion delineation and characterization (e.g. for outcome prediction), in addition to usual clinical variables. This is especially true in Head and Neck Cancer (HNC). The goal of the HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction (HECKTOR) challenge was to develop and compare modern image analysis methods to best extract and leverage this information automatically. We present here the post-analysis of HECKTOR 2nd edition, at the 24th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) 2021. The scope of the challenge was substantially expanded compared to the first edition, by providing a larger population (adding patients from a new clinical center) and proposing an additional task to the challengers, namely the prediction of Progression-Free Survival (PFS). To this end, the participants were given access to a training set of 224 cases from 5 different centers, each with a pre-treatment FDG-PET/CT scan and clinical variables. Their methods were subsequently evaluated on a held-out test set of 101 cases from two centers. For the segmentation task (Task 1), the ranking was based on a Borda counting of their ranks according to two metrics: mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and median Hausdorff Distance at 95th percentile (HD95). For the PFS prediction task, challengers could use the tumor contours provided by experts (Task 3) or rely on their own (Task 2). The ranking was obtained according to the Concordance index (C-index) calculated on the predicted risk scores. A total of 103 teams registered for the challenge, for a total of 448 submissions and 29 papers. The best method in the segmentation task obtained an average DSC of 0.759, and the best predictions of PFS obtained a C-index of 0.717 (without relying on the provided contours) and 0.698 (using the expert contours). An interesting finding was that best PFS predictions were reached by relying on DL approaches (with or without explicit tumor segmentation, 4 out of the 5 best ranked) compared to standard radiomics methods using handcrafted features extracted from delineated tumors, and by exploiting alternative tumor contours (automated and/or larger volumes encompassing surrounding tissues) rather than relying on the expert contours. This second edition of the challenge confirmed the promising performance of fully automated primary tumor delineation in PET/CT images of HNC patients, although there is still a margin for improvement in some difficult cases. For the first time, the prediction of outcome was also addressed and the best methods reached relatively good performance (C-index above 0.7). Both results constitute another step forward toward large-scale outcome prediction studies in HNC.

ID ERROR-BACKPROPAGATION
AB Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer the promise of low-power artificial intelligence. However, training deep SNNs from scratch or converting deep artificial neural networks to SNNs without loss of performance has been a challenge. Here we propose an exact mapping from a network with Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to an SNN that fires exactly one spike per neuron. For our constructive proof, we assume that an arbitrary multi-layer ReLU network with or without convolutional layers, batch normalization and max pooling layers was trained to high performance on some training set. Furthermore, we assume that we have access to a representative example of input data used during training and to the exact parameters (weights and biases) of the trained ReLU network. The mapping from deep ReLU networks to SNNs causes zero percent drop in accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and the ImageNet-like data sets Places365 and PASS. More generally our work shows that an arbitrary deep ReLU network can be replaced by an energy-efficient single-spike neural network without any loss of performance.

ID DEFECT PATTERNS; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; NETWORK
AB In the semiconductor manufacturing process, analyzing the defect patterns on a wafer map is crucial for identifying the causes of the defects. The advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has significantly increased the accuracy of automated wafer map pattern classification. Generally, the use of a larger training dataset results in higher classification accuracy. However, collecting a large number of wafer maps and labeling them with their defect categories is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we present an improved training method under data insufficiency for wafer map pattern classification. We apply supervised contrastive learning to train a CNN by exploiting the rotational-invariant characteristic of wafer map labeling. The CNN is trained by simultaneously minimizing two loss functions: classification loss and contrastive loss. The first loss function is to classify the rotational variants of wafer maps accurately. The second loss function is to align the representation vectors for the rotational variants of wafer maps with similar labels to be close to each other. Using two benchmark datasets, WM-811K and MixedWM38, we demonstrate that the proposed method enhances classification accuracy compared with existing methods, particularly when the training dataset is small.

DE Translation quality estimation; Machine translation; Pre-trained model;

AB Machine translation quality estimation (QE) aims to evaluate the result of translation without reference. Despite the progress it has made, state-of-the-art QE models are proven to be biased. More specifically, they over-rely on spurious statistical features while ignoring the bilingual semantic adequacy, leading to performance degradation. Besides, existing approaches require large amounts of annotation data, restricting their applications in new domains and languages. In this work, we propose a universal framework for quality estimation based on multi-view fusion. We first introduce noise to the target side of the parallel sentence pair, either by pre-trained language model or by large language model. After that, with the clean parallel pairs and the noised pairs as different views, the QE model is trained to distinguish the clean pairs from the noised ones. Our method can improve the accuracy and generalizability in supervised scenario, and can solely perform estimation in zero-shot scenario. We perform experiments on WMT QE evaluation datasets under different scenarios, verifying the effectiveness of our method. We also make an in-depth investigation of the bias of QE model.

DT Article
DE Scene sketch; Semantic segmentation; Hierarchical Transformer; Feature
   fusion; Sketch dataset
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have always been the dominant method for scene sketch semantic segmentation, but their performance seems to have plateaued due to the limitation of local receptive fields. To address this problem, we propose SketchSeger, a hierarchical Transformer-based model for scene sketch semantic segmentation. Accurate scene sketch segmentation relies on both high-level semantics and low-level details. To obtain better segmentation performance, we designed an MLP-based feature fusion module for the model decoder to merge feature maps captured at different scales efficiently. Compared to CNN-based models, SketchSeger exhibits a stronger ability in contextual modeling and can obtain global receptive fields even in its shallow layers. Besides the model architecture, the absence of large-scale pre-training datasets also presents a significant challenge for advancing scene sketch semantic segmentation. To promote further research, we propose a novel hand-drawn style scene sketch synthesis method and use it to synthesize a dataset containing 300,000 annotated scene sketches. We conduct extensive experiments and visual analysis to validate the efficacy of our proposed SketchSeger model and dataset synthesis approach. The results show that SketchSeger significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets (SketchyScene, SKY-Scene, and TUB-Scene) with similar parameter scales.

AB A tractogram is a virtual representation of the brain white matter. It is composed of millions of virtual fibers, encoded as 3D polylines, which approximate the white matter axonal pathways. To date, tractograms are the most accurate white matter representation and thus are used for tasks like presurgical planning and investigations of neuroplasticity, brain disorders, or brain networks. However, it is a well-known issue that a large portion of tractogram fibers is not anatomically plausible and can be considered artifacts of the tracking procedure. With Verifyber, we tackle the problem of filtering out such non-plausible fibers using a novel fully supervised learning approach. Differently from other approaches based on signal reconstruction and/or brain topology regularization, we guide our method with the existing anatomical knowledge of the white matter. Using tractograms annotated according to anatomical principles, we train our model, Verifyber, to classify fibers as either anatomically plausible or non-plausible. The proposed Verifyber model is an original Geometric Deep Learning method that can deal with variable size fibers, while being invariant to fiber orientation. Our model considers each fiber as a graph of points, and by learning features of the edges between consecutive points via the proposed sequence Edge Convolution, it can capture the underlying anatomical properties. The output filtering results highly accurate and robust across an extensive set of experiments, and fast; with a 12GB GPU, filtering a tractogram of 1M fibers requires less than a minute.

ID MODEL
AB Computationally replicating the behaviour of the cerebral cortex to perform the control tasks of daily life in a human being is a challenge today. First, it is necessary to know the structure and connections between the elements of the neural network that perform movement control. Next, a mathematical neural model that adequately resembles biological neurons has to be developed. Finally, a suitable learning model that allows adapting neural network response to changing conditions in the environment is also required. Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are currently the closest approximation to biological neural networks. SNNs make use of temporal spike trains to deal with inputs and outputs, thus allowing a faster and more complex computation. In this paper, a controller based on an SNN is proposed to perform the control of an anti-lock braking system (ABS) in vehicles. To this end, two neural networks are used to regulate the braking force. The first one is devoted to estimating the optimal slip while the second one is in charge of setting the optimal braking pressure. The latter resembles biological reflex arcs to ensure stability during operation. This neural structure is used to control the fast regulation cycles that occur during ABS operation. Furthermore, an algorithm has been developed to train the network while driving. On-line learning is proposed to update the response of the controller. Hence, to cope with real conditions, a control algorithm based on neural networks that learn by making use of neural plasticity, similar to what occurs in biological systems, has been implemented. Neural connections are modulated using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) by means of a supervised learning structure using the slip error as input. Road-type detection has been included in the same neural structure. To validate and to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations as well as experiments in a real vehicle were carried out. The algorithm proved to be able to adapt to changes in adhesion conditions rapidly. This way, the capability of spiking neural networks to perform the full control logic of the ABS has been verified.

ID EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; ENVIRONMENTS
AB Prediction-based dynamic multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms have become one of the main-stream methods for solving dynamic multiobjective optimization problems. However, the unknown nonlinear relationships in sequential environments bring great challenge to the construction of prediction model and the inevitable error between the historical obtained solutions and the real pareto-optimal solutions troubles the prediction accuracy. In this paper, a gradient boosting regression tree based dynamic multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm is proposed, called MOEA/D-XGB. The time series solutions formed by subspace decomposition are trained in the XGBoost-based predictor to produce a high-quality initial population when environmental change occurs. And a novel population promotion strategy based on generalized additive model is proposed to improve the quality of historical obtained solutions. The performance comparisons with five state-of-the-art algorithms have shown that MOEA/D-XGB achieves best performance in 59 out of 70 experiments on MIGD and 60 out of 70 experiments on MHV, respectively, which demonstrates that the proposed design is capable of significantly improving the performance of dynamic multiobjective optimization.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL
AB Accurately predicting the highway traffic speed can reduce traffic accidents and transit time, and it also provides valuable reference data for traffic control in advance. Three essential elements should be considered in highway traffic speed prediction: specialIntscript dynamic spatiotemporal correlation, specialIntscript prediction error propagation elimination, and specialIntscript traffic speed heterogeneity on the highway network. A multi-task-based spatiotemporal generative inference network (MT-STGIN) is proposed to address the above challenges. 1 MT-STGIN consists of three parts: an encoder based on spatiotemporal correlation extraction block (ST-Block), a decoder based on masked ST-Block and generative inference, and multi-task learning. The encoder is first used to extract the dynamic spatiotemporal correlation of the highway network. The decoder concentrates on correlating historical and -target sequences and generates the target hidden outputs rather than a dynamic step-by-step decoding way. Finally, a multi-task learning method is used to predict traffic speed on different types of road segments because of heterogeneity and shares the underlying network parameters. The evaluation experiments use the monitoring data of the highway in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, China. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed prediction model is better than that of the baselines, and it can efficiently solve the problem of long-term highway speed prediction.

AB In this paper we present SurvLIMEpy, an open-source Python package that implements the SurvLIME algorithm. This method allows to compute local feature importance for machine learning algorithms designed for modelling Survival Analysis data. The presented implementation uses a matrix-wise formulation, which allows to speed up the execution time. Additionally, SurvLIMEpy assists the user with visualisation tools to better understand the result of the algorithm. The package supports a wide variety of survival models, from the Cox Proportional Hazards Model to deep learning models such as DeepHit or DeepSurv. Two types of experiments are presented in this paper. First, by means of simulated data, we study the ability of the algorithm to capture the importance of the features. Second, we use three open source survival datasets together with a set of survival algorithms in order to demonstrate how SurvLIMEpy behaves when applied to different models.

AB Most current dam deformation prediction models (DDPM) are mainly based on long-term sequential data, but observational insufficiency is still a universal challenge in dam deformation forecasting for old dams with unreliable measurements or newly-built dams after short operation. This study proposes a feature decompositionbased deep transfer learning framework (FD-DTL) with short-term observation for concrete dam deformation prediction. Specifically, the variational mode decomposition (VMD), dispersion entropy (DE), and maximal information coefficient (MIC) are combined to decompose a single sequence into trend, periodic and random components. Then, dynamic time warping (DTW) is applied to match similar feature components from other dams and the target components. Based on transfer learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), a combined prediction model (TL-CNN-LSTM) is designed for each pair of similar feature components, and it transfers the generic knowledge learned from similar feature components to the target ones. Eventually, the predicted displacement is obtained by superimposing all feature components. The engineering application verifies that the proposed framework can effectively process and predict dam displacement under observational insufficiency with considerable generalization ability and computational accuracy, which provides a novel approach for establishment of DDPM with observational insufficiency.

AB Blasting operations are widely recognized as the most frequently used rock breakage approach in the field of Civil and Mining Engineering. However, the induced air-overpressure (AOp) can result in structural damages to surrounding buildings and therefore needs to be well predicted and subsequently minimized. In this study, a novel self-adaptive weighted kernel ridge regression (Sa-WKRR) was proposed to predict blast induced AOp, which used a self-adaptive weighting strategy to improve the performance of traditional kernel ridge regression (KRR). The model was developed and validated on two blasting datasets. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed Sa-WKRR was compared with 9 other machine learning models, i.e., KRR, kernel random vector functional link (KRVFL), Sa-WKRVFL, transductive KRR (TKRR), ensemble deep RVFL (edRVFL), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The optimal performance of these models were obtained using grid search method and compared by three evaluation indices, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and correlation coefficient (R). The results demonstrated that the proposed Sa-WKRR has the best performance in two datasets, with RMSE of 0.46/1.98, MAPE of 0.30% and 1.20%, and R of 0.9991/0.9235 in Case study 1 and RMSE of 1.03/3.22, MAPE of 0.76%/2.74%, and R of 0.9965/0.9373 in Case study 2. Findings revealed that the proposed Sa-WKRR emerged as the most powerful and stable technique in predicting blast induced AOp compared with other machine learning models. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

ID SUPERRESOLUTION; ALGORITHM
AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most significant modalities in medical imaging. It suffers from rather lengthy acquisition times, which lead to prolonged patient restriction, patient discomfort, and imaging artifacts. Hence, satisfactory MRI reconstruction from undersampled data sequences constitutes an important research problem. With the advances in deep learning (DL), a plethora of new models have been proposed to solve the MRI reconstruction problem using deep networks. On the other hand, single image super-resolution (SR) is another well-studied field that benefited from the success of DL, and it has applications in various imaging modalities. SR is the process of recovering a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image. SR models work on low-resolution images to recover missing details. MR image reconstruction on the other hand is a battle to eliminate the aliasing artifacts which originate from data downsampling. The motivation for the proposed work is based on the premise that SR approaches can possibly get adapted to MR image reconstruction. Hence in this study, inspired by the great success of deep SR networks, we customize an architecture introduced in SR setting to MRI reconstruction. This novel approach uses the iterative up and downsampling framework labeled as Iterative Up and Down Network (IUDN) for MRI reconstruction. We design two variants of the proposed network with different number of scale factors. We present extensive simulations for the proposed architecture using multiple k-space undersampling ratios. The simulation results indicate cutting edge MRI reconstruction performance for the proposed models. The networks were trained on fastMRI dataset and tested on both fastMRI and IXI datasets to show the robustness of the method. The proposed models achieved improved results in terms of PSNR and visual quality of the reconstructed image when compared to some recent state-of-the-art solutions for MRI reconstruction.

AB Data fabric is an automated and AI-driven data fusion approach to accomplish data management unification without moving data to a centralized location for solving complex data problems. In a Federated learning architecture, the global model is trained based on the learned parameters of several local models that eliminate the necessity of moving data to a centralized repository for machine learning. This paper introduces a secure approach for medical image analysis using federated learning and partially homomorphic encryption within a distributed data fabric architecture. With this method, multiple users or clients (hospitals/medical data centers) can collaborate in training a machine-learning model without exchanging raw data. The approach complies with laws and regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, ensuring the privacy and security of the data. The study demonstrates the method's effectiveness through a case study on pituitary tumor classification, achieving a significant accuracy of 83.31%. However, the primary focus of the study is using the data fabric architecture to securely store and analyze medical images while complying with HIPAA and GDPR regulations. The results highlight the potential of these techniques to be applied to other privacy-sensitive domains and contribute to the growing body of research on secure and privacy-preserving machine learning.

AB With the rapid expansion of the scale of a dynamic network, local community evolution analysis attracts much attention because of its efficiency and accuracy. It concentrates on a particularly interested community rather than considering all communities together. A fundamental problem is how to divide time into slices so that a dynamic network is represented as a sequence of snapshots which accurately capture the evolutionary events of the interested community. Existing time slicing methods lead to inaccurate evolution analysis results. The reason is that they usually rely on a linear strategy while the community evolution is a nonlinear process. This paper investigates the problem and proposes a classifier-based time slicing method for local community evolution analysis. First, a classifier is trained for judging whether there is a community in the given network snapshot is identified as the continuing of the community defined by the given node subset. The features for classification include internal cohesion degree and external coupling degree. Second, a time slicing method is proposed based on the trained classifier. As the network evolves, the method continuously uses the classifier to predict whether there is a community in the newest network identified as the continuing of the interested community. Whenever the answer is negative, an evolutionary event is presumed to have occurred and a new time slice is generated. Experimental results show that compared with existing time slicing methods, our proposed method achieves higher recognition rate for given redundancy ratio.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Exploration and exploitation;
   Scheduling; Sparse reward
AB Conventional hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) relies on discrete options to represent explicitly distinguishable knowledge, which may lead to severe performance bottlenecks. It is possible to represent richer knowledge through continuous options, but reliable scheduling methods are lacking. To design an available scheduling method for continuous options, in this paper, the hierarchical reinforcement learning with adaptive scheduling (HAS) algorithm is proposed. Its low-level controller learns diverse options, while the high-level controller schedules options to learn solutions. It achieves an adaptive balance between exploration and exploitation during the frequent scheduling of continuous options, maximizing the representation potential of continuous options. It builds on multi-step static scheduling and makes switching decisions according to the relative advantages of the previous and the estimated continuous options, enabling the agent to focus on different behaviors at different phases of the task. The expected t-step distance is applied to demonstrate the superiority of adaptive scheduling in terms of exploration. Furthermore, an interruption incentive based on annealing is proposed to alleviate excessive exploration during the early training phase, accelerating the convergence rate. Finally, we apply HAS to robot control with sparse rewards in continuous spaces, and develop a comprehensive experimental analysis scheme. The experimental results not only demonstrate the high performance and robustness of HAS, but also provide evidence that the adaptive scheduling method has a positive effect both on the representation and option policies.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; FILTER
AB Data classification is the most common task in machine learning, and feature selection is the key step in the classification task. Common feature selection methods mainly analyze the maximum correlation and minimum redundancy between feature factors and tags while ignoring the impact of the number of key features, which will inevitably lead to waste in subsequent classification training. To solve this problem, a feature selection algorithm (SSMI) based on the combination of sinusoidal sequences and mutual information is proposed. First, the mutual information between each feature and tag is calculated, and the interference information in high-dimensional data is removed according to the mutual information value. Second, a sine function is constructed, and sine ordering is carried out according to the mutual information value and feature mean value between different categories of the same feature. By adjusting the period and phase value of the sequence, the feature set with the largest difference is found, and the subset of key features is obtained. Finally, three machine learning classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM) are used to classify key feature subsets, and several feature selection algorithms (JMI, mRMR, CMIM, SFS, etc.) are compared to verify the advantages and disadvantages of different algorithms. Compared with other feature selection methods, the SSMI algorithm obtains the least number of key features, with an average reduction of 15 features. The average classification accuracy has been improved by 3% on the KNN classifier. On the HBV and SDHR datasets, the SSMI algorithm achieved classification accuracy of 81.26% and 83.12%, with sensitivity and specificity results of 76.28%, 87.39% and 68.14%, 86.11%, respectively. This shows that the SSMI algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy with a smaller feature subset.

AB Autonomous Forklifts (AFs) play a vital role in smart factories, particularly in the transportation of heavy loads. However, their energy consumption poses a significant challenge as they need to operate for extended periods on a single battery charge. Therefore, energy-efficient motion is necessary to raise their availability. The AF's movement is dynamically determined by a motion planning algorithm within its navigation system. In light of this, this article introduces a strategy to improve energy efficiency during the motion planning phase. This strategy involves a cooperative approach, utilizing the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and AF's kinetic model to achieve this energy-saving goal. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on the vehicle's kinematic model, our approach considers an additional factor, incorporating the influence of the vehicle's kinetic model for a more comprehensive and accurate energy consumption analysis. First, the kinetic model of an AF is developed by considering the effect of the front-powered wheel. Second, the kinetic model is employed within a time-energy optimization technique, aiming to find the AF's ideal acceleration. This optimization process generates a dataset that covers a range of AF maneuvers and dynamic parameters. Third, a DNNs model is trained using this dataset to predict the optimal acceleration for the AF. Finally, the trained model is integrated into a motion planning algorithm to determine the optimal and acceptable limits for both linear and angular acceleration. Experiments illustrate that the suggested motion planning method can generate trajectories that are both feasible and optimized for energy consumption. This differs significantly from the typical algorithms which generally results in higher energy use by the AF, occasionally leading to the generation of infeasible trajectories.

ID EARTHMOVING EXCAVATORS; POSE ESTIMATION; RECOGNITION; SYSTEM
AB Artificial intelligence algorithms employed for classifying excavator-related activities predominantly rely on sensors embedded within individual machinery or computer vision (CV) techniques encompassing a large scene. The existing CV-based methods are often difficult to tackle an image including multiple excavators and other cooperating machinery. This study presents a novel framework tailored to the classification of excavator activities, accounting for both the excavator itself and the dumpers collaborating with the excavator during operations. Distinct from most existing related studies, this method centres on the transformed heterogeneous graph data constructed using the keypoints of all cooperating machinery extracted from an image. The resulting model leverages the relationships between the mechanical components of an excavator in varying activation states and the associations between the excavator and the collaborating machinery. The framework commences with a novel definition of keypoints representing different machinery relevant to the targetted activities. A customised Machinery Keypoint R-CNN method is then developed to extract these keypoints, forming the basis of graph notes. By considering the type, attribute and edge of nodes, a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network is finally utilised for activity recognition. The results suggest that the proposed framework can effec-tively predict earthwork activities (with an accuracy of up to 97.5%) when the image encompasses multiple excavators and cooperating machinery. This solution holds promising potential for the automated measurement and management of earthwork productivity within the construction industry. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/gillesflash/Keypoints-Based-Heterogeneous-Graph-Convolutional-Networks.git.

AB Cancer disease has been classified as a perilous disease for humans, being the second leading cause of death globally. Even advanced-stage diagnosis may not be effective in preventing patient mortality. Therefore, it is important to establish a sustainable framework that predicts reliable estimates for an early cancer diagnosis. In this paper, a new two-phase feature (gene) selection approach is presented. In the first phase, the kernel Shapley value (kSV) that is based on the cooperative game-theoretic feature extraction approach is utilized to extract the important feature from the high dimensional gene expression data. In the second phase, Harris hawks optimizer (HHO) algorithm is utilized to further optimize the most effective feature extracted by kSV. Next, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark high-dimensional gene expression datasets, comparing them with other state-of-the-art techniques. We employ three classifiers, namely support vector machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and K -nearest neighbors (KNN), to assess the selected genes efficacy and their impact on classification accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method, particularly when combined with the SVM classifier, outperforms other gene selection methods. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, box plot, and radar plot, consistently indicate the superiority of kSV-HHO across all tested datasets. Moreover, the comparative and statistical analysis reveals that our proposed method excels in identifying the most relevant features for cancer diagnosis compared to other gene selection approaches. This makes our framework a valuable tool for cancer research and clinical practice, potentially enhancing the accuracy of early cancer diagnosis using high-dimensional gene expression biomedical data.

ID REVERSIBLE WATERMARKING; RELATIONAL DATABASES; ROBUST
AB In this paper, we propose a local binary pattern (LBP) feature and hash function based dual watermarking algorithm for database. Attribute feature columns are selected to generate zero watermarks using the Pearson correlation method. The zero watermarks are generated by the LBP. The attribute values of the selected feature columns are divided into two parts for embedding and extracting the watermark. Zero watermark feature code is embedded into the lowest significant bit of the selected attribute column by using the database watermarking algorithm with hash function for copyright authentication. The proposed method uses two-layer hashing method to improve the robustness. In the watermark extraction, a method of combining majority voting and Hamming error correction code is used to control the watermark error to ensure the correct extraction rate of the watermark. Experimental results show that the algorithm not only provides good availability of the database after embedding the watermark, but also ensures the correct extraction of the watermark after various attacks.

In this paper, we propose a graph-based approach called Sparse Graph-based Multi-hop Question Answering system (SG-MQA), which provides a throughout examination of the mentioned challenges and presents appropriate measures to address them. We propose a novel approach based on the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) that reduces the model complexity and improves its performance. We have utilized various strategies and conducted multiple experiments to achieve this goal. We show the efficacy of the proposed approach by examining the results of experiments on two QA datasets, namely WikiHop and HotpotQA. The SG-MQA model outperforms all the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on WikiHop and increases the accuracy of the best previous approach from 74.4% to 78.3%. Additionally, it achieves acceptable performance on HotpotQA. Although, according to the F1 measure, the performance of SG-MQA is inferior to that of the SOTA model, it is comparable to that of all other approaches. On the other hand, based on the Exact Match (EM) measure, SG-MQA shows comparable performance to that of the SOTA model and outperforms all other approaches.

AB Blended-wing-body underwater gliders (BWBUGs) are low cost and have high endurance. As such, they are highly suitable for underwater search missions. However, the search path planning of BWBUGs presents significant challenges due to the complexities in designing the planning model and solution algorithm. In this study, we propose a novel chaotic heuristic assisted method (CHAM) for search missions involving multi-BWBUG cooperative systems. First, our approach addresses the challenges by introducing a probabilistic sensing model that accurately describes the detection performance of the BWBUG. Then, a search path planning model of the multi-BWBUG cooperative system is developed on the basis of the cumulative detection probability and communication energy consumption ratio. Second, we propose the sine-cosine chaos strategy, which exhibits earlier chaotic state entry and higher ergodicity compared to the sine chaos strategy. Leveraging this, CHAM integrates the sine-cosine chaos strategy with a well-designed hierarchical collaboration mechanism. The proposed algorithm adapts different position update strategies at various stages to enhance convergence speed and avoid local optima. Finally, the simulation experiments and statistical analysis results provide compelling evidence that CHAM excels in performing search path planning for the multi-BWBUG cooperative system, and the comprehensive performance of CHAM is better than that of comparison algorithms.

AB This article investigates the asymptotic stabilization of periodic piecewise time-varying systems with time-varying delay under various cyber attacks, particularly deception and DoS attacks. The addressed system is reformed into a number of time-varying subsystems based on the time interval for each period. Following that, a state-feedback controller with periodic time-varying gain parameters is developed to solve the stabilization problem. The control design depicts the possibility of the aforementioned cyber attacks with two mutually exclusive stochastic Bernoulli distributed parameters. Then, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with periodically varying matrices is used to determine the conditions for designing the proposed controller that ensures the mean-square asymptotic stability of the addressed system. The results of numerical examples support the conclusion that the proposed method is effective and superior, regardless of the cyber attacks involved.

AB Transfer learning has attracted considerable attention in medical image analysis because of the limited number of annotated 3-D medical datasets available for training data-driven deep learning models in the real world. We propose Medical Transformer, a novel transfer learning framework that effectively models 3-D volumetric images as a sequence of 2-D image slices. To improve the high-level representation in 3-D-form empowering spatial relations, we use a multiview approach that leverages information from three planes of the 3-D volume, while providing parameter-efficient training. For building a source model generally applicable to various tasks, we pretrain the model using self-supervised learning (SSL) for masked encoding vector prediction as a proxy task, using a large-scale normal, healthy brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset. Our pretrained model is evaluated on three downstream tasks: 1) brain disease diagnosis; 2) brain age prediction; and 3) brain tumor segmentation, which are widely studied in brain MRI research. Experimental results demonstrate that our Medical Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) transfer learning methods, efficiently reducing the number of parameters by up to approximately 92% for classification and regression tasks and 97% for segmentation task, and it also achieves good performance in scenarios where only partial training samples are used.

AB In order to maintain adequate levels of cleanliness and sanitation in public facilities, prevent the buildup of viruses and other harmful pathogens, and ensure health and safety, health and labor authorities have repeatedly warned of the need to adhere to proper disinfection protocols in the workplace. This is particularly important in public places where food is handled, where there are more vulnerable people, including hospitals and health care centers, or where there is a large concentration of people. One promising approach is the combination of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light and mobile robots to automate disinfection processes. Being this technology effective for disinfection, an excessive dose of UV can damage the materials, limiting its applicability. Therefore, a major challenge for automatic disinfection is to find a route that covers the entire surface, ensures cleanliness, and provides the correct radiation dose while preventing environmental materials from being damaged. To achieve this, in this paper a novel intelligent control approach is proposed. A bio-inspired Glasius neural network with a motion planner, an UV estimation module, a speed regulator, and pure pursuit controller are combined into one intelligent system. The motion planner proposes a sequence of movements to go through the space in the most efficient way possible, avoiding obstacles of the environment. The speed controller adjusts the dose of UV-C radiation and the pure pursuit regulator ensures the following of the path. This approach has been tested in various simulation scenarios of increasing complexity and in four different areas of dosing requirements. In simulation, a 44% reduction of the maximum dose is achieved, 17% less distance travelled by the robot and, what is more important, 229% more locations with the appropriate dose.

AB This article proposes a novel event-triggered second-order sliding mode (SOSM) control algorithm using the small-gain theorems. The developed algorithm has global event property in aspects of the triggering time intervals. First, an SOSM controller is designed related to the sampling error of states, and it is proved that the closed-loop system is finite-time input-to-state stable (FTISS) with the sampling error via utilizing the small-gain theorems. Second, combined with the constructed SOSM controller, a new triggering mechanism is proposed depending on the sampling error by designing the appropriate FTISS gain condition. Third, the practical finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is verified. It is shown that the minimum triggering time interval is always a positive value in the whole state space. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control method.

ID ATTRIBUTE REDUCTION
AB K-nearest neighborhood information granularity-based feature selection is derived from the well-known k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification technique, which is widely employed in data mining. However, the current k-nearest neighborhood-based information granules cannot effectively handle data with different density distributions. To address this problem, a sparse mutual granularity-based feature selection approach is developed. First, a personalized information granule is constructed based on the optimal k values for each sample. The optimal k value is obtained through the number of correlated samples, where the correlations between the samples are learned by the sparse constraint function. The achieved optimal k can define the size of the granularity-based model and increase the classification accuracy. Second, a mutual-information strategy is introduced in the granularity process. Irrelevant samples in the granularity-based model are removed, which improves the classification performance. Third, an improved heuristic feature selection algorithm is developed to address the nonmonotonic problem. Compared with the classical heuristic method, the proposed feature selection method can improve the performance of the obtained subset and avoid degradation caused by non-monotonicity. The experimental results on the UCI datasets show that the sparse mutual granularity-based feature selection approach is effective for managing data with different density distributions. Finally, the proposed feature selection approach is applied to select significant brain regions in several schizophrenia datasets. It contributes to the prediction of schizophrenia and also provides a new direction for the improvement of medical-image analysis.

ID OBJECT CLASSES
AB Multi-view data are characterized by a variety of features that are semantically coherent, with different views usually complementing each other. Multi-view clustering seeks to learn a unified representation that is comprehensive yet discriminative to partition the samples. However, existing research ignored the possible redundancy of latent feature in each view, then yielded a unified task-oriented feature based on the correlation of these multi-view latent features without explicit consideration of the influence of the unified feature. Such a way failed to accurately measure the association among views. To fully take the association into account, we propose a deep multi-view Unified Representation Learning network, named by deep-URL, using measurement between multi-view data to realize desirable unified representation. Specifically, deep-URL employs a multi-view encoder-decoder framework that maps multi-scale data into a same latent space to obtain view-specific latent representation. Within each view, the view-specific features are pruned to eliminate the redundant information in the latent space by minimizing the within-view mutual information. Between the multiple views, a unified informative representation is derived to accurately estimate the nonlinear associations between views via maximizing conditional mutual information of the view-specific features. The deep unified representation is further elaborated to achieve the full reconstruction of each view to ensure its reliability. The proposed network is trained by between/within view deep representation majorization. It achieves redundant representation removal within each view, unified features integration across views, and universal reconstruction via decoding.

AB Multiview clustering has attracted increasing attention to automatically divide instances into various groups without manual annotations. Traditional shadow methods discover the internal structure of data, while deep multiview clustering (DMVC) utilizes neural networks with clustering-friendly data embeddings. Although both of them achieve impressive performance in practical applications, we find that the former heavily relies on the quality of raw features, while the latter ignores the structure information of data. To address the above issue, we propose a novel method termed iterative deep structural graph contrast clustering (IDSGCC) for multiview raw data consisting of topology learning (TL), representation learning (RL), and graph structure contrastive learning to achieve better performance. The TL module aims to obtain a structured global graph with constraint structural information and then guides the RL to preserve the structural information. In the RL module, graph convolutional network (GCN) takes the global structural graph and raw features as inputs to aggregate the samples of the same cluster and keep the samples of different clusters away. Unlike previous methods performing contrastive learning at the representation level of the samples, in the graph contrastive learning module, we conduct contrastive learning at the graph structure level by imposing a regularization term on the similarity matrix. The credible neighbors of the samples are constructed as positive pairs through the credible graph, and other samples are constructed as negative pairs. The three modules promote each other and finally obtain clustering-friendly embedding. Also, we set up an iterative update mechanism to update the topology to obtain a more credible topology. Impressive clustering results are obtained through the iterative mechanism. Comparative experiments on eight multiview datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art traditional and deep clustering competitors.

TI ARISE: Graph Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks via Substructure
   Awareness
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Attributed networks; graph anomaly detection; graph neural networks
   (GNNs); network substructure
AB Recently, graph anomaly detection on attributed networks has attracted growing attention in data mining and machine learning communities. Apart from attribute anomalies, graph anomaly detection also aims at suspicious topological-abnormal nodes that exhibit collective anomalous behavior. Closely connected uncorrelated node groups form uncommonly dense substructures in the network. However, existing methods overlook that the topology anomaly detection performance can be improved by recognizing such a collective pattern. To this end, we propose a new graph anomaly detection framework on attributed networks via substructure awareness (ARISE). Unlike previous algorithms, we focus on the substructures in the graph to discern abnormalities. Specifically, we establish a region proposal module to discover high-density substructures in the network as suspicious regions. The average node-pair similarity can be regarded as the topology anomaly degree of nodes within substructures. Generally, the lower the similarity, the higher the probability that internal nodes are topology anomalies. To distill better embeddings of node attributes, we further introduce a graph contrastive learning scheme, which observes attribute anomalies in the meantime. In this way, ARISE can detect both topology and attribute anomalies. Ultimately, extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that ARISE greatly improves detection performance (up to 7.30% AUC and 17.46% AUPRC gains) compared to state-of-the-art attributed networks anomaly detection (ANAD) algorithms.

AB The recent developments in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and indoor hybrid LiFi-WiFi networks (HLWNs) present a significant opportunity for creating low-cost, power-efficient, reliable, flexible, and ad-hoc HLWN-enabled indoor flying networks (IFNs). However, to efficiently operate and practically realize indoor HLWN, a unified physical layer (UniPHY) is indispensable for joint communication (control and data transfer) and sensing (e.g., localization). A UniPHY structure reduces costs and increases overall flexibility for HLWN-based IFNs. While conventional block-based wireless transceivers independently designed for LiFi and WiFi offer mediocre performance for a composite UniPHY waveform, a machine learning-based end-to-end learning framework for UniPHY can improve overall error performance and reduce the complexity of UAV transceiver hardware. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel generic end-to-end learning framework for a UniPHY system that can efficiently enable HLWN. The performance of the proposed learning framework based on deep neural networks (DNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is investigated. Additionally, we assess the computational complexity of the proposed DNN and CNN learning frameworks. The results demonstrate that the performance of DNNs and CNNs varies depending on the considered channel model. Specifically, the analysis reveals that CNNs outperform traditional DNNs in WiFi (Rayleigh fading-based) channels. In contrast, traditional DNNs perform better than CNNs in LiFi (additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-based) channels.

AB The pollution caused by aerosol (particulate matter) has a detrimental impact on urban environments, particularly in terms of socio-economic factors and public health. Aerosol particles, ranging in size from 1 nm to 100 lm, can easily penetrate organic tissues, carrying toxic gaseous compounds and minerals such as carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Recent advancements in neural network technology, combined with deep learning techniques, have made it possible to predict surges in aerosol pollution. In this study, we introduce DAerosol-NTM, a deep learning framework that utilizes the latest developments in neural Turing machines (NTMs) to access external memory. When compared with four baseline studies that employ multilayer perceptron (MLP), deep neural networks (DNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and deep LSTM (DLSTM), DAerosol-NTM significantly improves prediction accuracy by 8-31% and precision by 46-91% and reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 24-85%. Additionally, DAerosol-NTM incorporates up to 20 years of particulate matter data in its external storage, making it the first model capable of predicting aerosol pollution surges. By analyzing the data from the previous 96 h, the optimal time interval before and after the aerosol event (TIBAAE) enables the prediction of aerosol events within the following 24 h.

   perceptron; Multi-head attention; Ligature error rate (LER).
AB The handwritten Urdu text recognition is a challenging area in pattern recognition and has gained much importance after the rapid emergence of several camera-based applications on portable devices, which facilitate the daily processing of plenty of images. The various challenges encountered in handwritten Urdu recognition are writer-dependent variations amongst different Urdu writers, irregular positioning of diacritics associated with a character, context sensitivity of characters, and cursive nature of Urdu script. These challenges also make it difficult to formulate a large generalized handwritten Urdu dataset. The state-of-the-art approaches proposed for the recognition of handwritten Urdu text mostly focus on implicit approaches. These approaches are error prone and do not yield significant recognition rates. The holistic approach of handwritten Urdu recognition has been least explored to date and the existing holistic approaches are complex and time consuming as they mostly rely on convolutional/recurrent neural networks or statistical methods. Hence, in this research, a novel and efficient vision transformer-based methodology using BERT architecture has been proposed to the recognition of handwritten Urdu text. The proposed approach uses convolution feature maps as word embedding in the transformer that makes full use of the powerful attention mechanism of the vision transformer to focus on a particular connected component (ligature) in handwritten Urdu text. To cover the entire Urdu corpus, we have pre-trained several benchmark handwritten Urdu datasets such as UNHD and NUST-UHWR and tested unconstrained handwritten Urdu text. In comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques, the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach reports the better results of the various performance parameters such as Ligature Error Rate (LER), precision, sensitivity, specificity, f1-score, and accuracy. The great success of the proposed approach lies in (i) the significant reduction of training time needed to train a large handwritten Urdu dataset, (ii) minimum computational complexity as there is no overhead of diacritic separation and re-association as used in most of the state-of-the-art techniques, and (iii) the proposed approach registers a new state-of-the-art LER of up to 3% only on unconstrained handwritten Urdu text.

AB Featured by multi-charge, multi-process integration, multi-constraint, steelmaking and continuous casting (SCC) scheduling is a complex and industrial synthesis process. Generally, it is solved by the two-stage or multistage approach. To reduce time consumption, we propose a "one-stage" optimization method that integrates the constraints into the cuckoo search algorithm (CICSA). To obtain the minimum total waiting time (TWT), we built an SCC scheduling optimization model. Firstly, we integrate machine uniqueness constraints and the process sequence into the coding of the nests. Then, non-conflict constraints and casting on time constraints are converted into the fitness values of the cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). Thus, the solutions obtained in the population after iteration meet the process constraints. The non-conflict optimal nest is taken as the optimal solution. Simulations are conducted using the actual industrial data. Comparisons among the proposed algorithm, the two-stage algorithm, and the original CSA are presented. The result shows the proposed approach achieves better performance.

We consider a system with several parties that wish to collaboratively learn a global function. Each party holds a local dataset; the datasets have different features but share the same sample ID space. The parties are heterogeneous in nature: the parties' operating speeds, local model architectures, and optimizers may be different from one another and, further, they may change over time. To train a global model in such a system, Flex-VFL utilizes a form of parallel block coordinate descent (P-BCD), where parties train a partition of the global model via stochastic coordinate descent. We provide theoretical convergence analysis for Flex-VFL and show that the convergence rate is constrained by the party speeds and local optimizer parameters. We apply this analysis and extend our algorithm to adapt party learning rates in response to changing speeds and local optimizer parameters. Finally, we compare the convergence time of Flex-VFL against synchronous and asynchronous VFL algorithms, as well as illustrate the effectiveness of our adaptive extension.

AB Background. Malware, malicious software, is the major security concern of the digital realm. Conventional cyber-security solutions are challenged by sophisticated malicious behaviors. Currently, an overlap between malicious and legitimate behaviors causes more difficulties in characterizing those behaviors as malicious or legitimate activities. For instance, evasive malware often mimics legitimate behaviors, and evasion techniques are utilized by legitimate and malicious software.Problem. Most of the existing solutions use the traditional term of frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique or its concept to represent malware behaviors. However, the traditional TF-IDF and the developed techniques represent the features, especially the shared ones, inaccurately because those techniques calculate a weight for each feature without considering its distribution in each class; instead, the generated weight is generated based on the distribution of the feature among all the documents. Such presumption can reduce the meaning of those features, and when those features are used to classify malware, they lead to a high false alarms.Method. This study proposes a Kullback-Liebler Divergence-based Term Frequency Probability Class Distribution (KLD-based TF-PCD) algorithm to represent the extracted features based on the differences between the probability distributions of the terms in malware and benign classes. Unlike the existing solution, the proposed algorithm increases the weights of the important features by using the Kullback-Liebler Divergence tool to measure the differences between their probability distributions in malware and benign classes.Results. The experimental results show that the proposed KLD-based TF-PCD algorithm achieved an accuracy of 0.972, the false positive rate of 0.037, and the F-measure of 0.978. Such results were significant compared to the related work studies. Thus, the proposed KLD-based TF-PCD algorithm contributes to improving the security of cyberspace.Conclusion. New meaningful characteristics have been added by the proposed algorithm to promote the learned knowledge of the classifiers, and thus increase their ability to classify malicious behaviors accurately.

AB Intrusion detection ensures that IoT can protect itself against malicious intrusions in extensive and intricate network traffic data. In recent years, deep learning has been extensively and effectively employed in IoT intrusion detection. However, the limited computing power and storage space of IoT devices restrict the feasibility of deploying resource-intensive intrusion detection systems on them. This article introduces the DL-BiLSTM lightweight IoT intrusion detection model. By combining deep neural networks (DNNs) and bidirectional long short-term memory networks (BiLSTMs), the model enables nonlinear and bidirectional long-distance feature extraction of complex network information. This capability allows the system to capture complex patterns and behaviors related to cyber-attacks, thus enhancing detection performance. To address the resource constraints of IoT devices, the model utilizes the incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) algorithm for feature dimensionality reduction. Additionally, dynamic quantization is employed to trim the specified cell structure of the model, thereby reducing the computational burden on IoT devices while preserving accurate detection capability. The experimental results on the benchmark datasets CIC IDS2017, N-BaIoT, and CICIoT2023 demonstrate that DL-BiLSTM surpasses traditional deep learning models and cutting-edge detection techniques in terms of detection performance, while maintaining a lower model complexity.

AB In the field of automatic text simplification, assessing whether or not the meaning of the original text has been preserved during simplification is of paramount importance. Metrics relying on n-gram overlap assessment may struggle to deal with simplifications which replace complex phrases with their simpler paraphrases. Current evaluation metrics for meaning preservation based on large language models (LLMs), such as BertScore in machine translation or QuestEval in summarization, have been proposed. However, none has a strong correlation with human judgment of meaning preservation. Moreover, such metrics have not been assessed in the context of text simplification research. In this study, we present a meta-evaluation of several metrics we apply to measure content similarity in text simplification. We also show that the metrics are unable to pass two trivial, inexpensive content preservation tests. Another contribution of this study is MeaningBERT (https://github.com/GRAAL-Research/MeaningBERT), a new trainable metric designed to assess meaning preservation between two sentences in text simplification, showing how it correlates with human judgment. To demonstrate its quality and versatility, we will also present a compilation of datasets used to assess meaning preservation and benchmark our study against a large selection of popular metrics.

ID INDUSTRY
AB With the development of machine perception and multimodal information decision-making techniques, autonomous driving technology has become a crucial area of advancement in the transportation industry. The optimization of vehicle navigation, path planning, and obstacle avoidance tasks is of paramount importance. In this study, we explore the use of attention mechanisms in a end-to-end architecture for optimizing obstacle avoidance and path planning in autonomous driving vehicles. We position our research within the broader context of robotics, emphasizing the fusion of information and decision-making capabilities. The introduction of attention mechanisms enables vehicles to perceive the environment more accurately by focusing on important information and making informed decisions in complex scenarios. By inputting multimodal information, such as images and LiDAR data, into the attention mechanism module, the system can automatically learn and weigh crucial environmental features, thereby placing greater emphasis on key information during obstacle avoidance decisions. Additionally, we leverage the end-to-end architecture and draw from classical theories and algorithms in the field of robotics to enhance the perception and decision-making abilities of autonomous driving vehicles. Furthermore, we address the optimization of path planning using attention mechanisms. We transform the vehicle's navigation task into a sequential decision-making problem and employ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to handle dynamic navigation in varying environments. By applying attention mechanisms to weigh key points along the navigation path, the vehicle can flexibly select the optimal route and dynamically adjust it based on real-time conditions. Finally, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations and software experiments on the proposed end-to-end architecture on real road datasets. The method effectively avoids obstacles, adheres to traffic rules, and achieves stable, safe, and efficient autonomous driving in diverse road scenarios. This research provides an effective solution for optimizing obstacle avoidance and path planning in the field of autonomous driving. Moreover, it contributes to the advancement and practical applications of multimodal information fusion in navigation, localization, and human-robot interaction.

AB To obtain a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), fusing a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) is a prominent approach. Numerous approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been presented for hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) fusion. Nevertheless, these CNN-based methods may ignore the global relevant features from the input image due to the geometric limitations of convolutional kernels. To obtain more accurate fusion results, we provide a spatial-spectral transformer-based U-net (SSTF-Unet). Our SSTF-Unet can capture the association between distant features and explore the intrinsic information of images. More specifically, we use the spatial transformer block (SATB) and spectral transformer block (SETB) to calculate the spatial and spectral self-attention, respectively. Then, SATB and SETB are connected in parallel to form the spatial-spectral fusion block (SSFB). Inspired by the U-net architecture, we build up our SSTF-Unet through stacking several SSFBs for multiscale spatial-spectral feature fusion. Experimental results on public HSI datasets demonstrate that the designed SSTF-Unet achieves better performance than other existing HSI and MSI fusion approaches.

ID NETWORK
AB For fine-grained human perception tasks such as pose estimation and activity recognition, radar-based sensors show advantages over optical cameras in low-visibility, privacy-aware, and wall-occlusive environments. Radar transmits radio frequency signals to irradiate the target of interest and store the target information in the echo signals. One common approach is to transform the echoes into radar images and extract the features with convolutional neural networks. This article introduces RadarFormer, the first method that introduces the self-attention (SA) mechanism to perform human perception tasks directly from radar echoes. It bypasses the imaging algorithm and realizes end-to-end signal processing. Specifically, we give constructive proof that processing radar echoes using the SA mechanism is at least as expressive as processing radar images using the convolutional layer. On this foundation, we design RadarFormer, which is a Transformer-like model to process radar signals. It benefits from the fast-/slow-time SA mechanism considering the physical characteristics of radar signals. RadarFormer extracts human representations from radar echoes and handles various downstream human perception tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art radar-based methods both in performance and computational cost and obtains accurate human perception results even in dark and occlusive environments.

AB The continuous Hopfield network (CHN) has provided a powerful approach to optimization problems and has shown good performance in different domains. However, two primary challenges still remain for this network: defining appropriate parameters and hyperparameters. In this study, our objective is to address these challenges and achieve optimal solutions for combinatorial optimization problems, thereby improving the overall performance of the continuous Hopfield network. To accomplish this, we propose a new technique for tuning the parameters of the CHN by considering its stability. To evaluate our approach, three well-known combinatorial optimization problems, namely, weighted constraint satisfaction problems, task assignment problems, and the traveling salesman problem, were employed. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach offers several advantages for CHN parameter tuning and the selection of optimal hyperparameter combinations.

   Image classification
AB Capsule networks (CapsNets) are new neural networks that classify images based on the spatial relationships of features. By analyzing the pose of features and their relative positions, it is more capable of recognizing images after affine transformation. The stacked capsule autoencoder (SCAE) is a state-of-the-art CapsNet that achieved unsupervised classification of CapsNets for the first time. However, the security vulnerabilities and the robustness of the SCAE have rarely been explored. In this paper, we propose an evasion attack against SCAE, where the attacker can generate adversarial perturbations by reducing the contribution of the object capsules related to the original category of the image in the SCAE. Adversarial perturbations are then applied to the original images, and the perturbed images are misclassified with a high probability. For such an evasion attack, we further propose a defense method called hybrid adversarial training (HAT), which makes use of adversarial training and adversarial distillation to achieve better robustness of SCAE against the evasion attack. We evaluate the defense method and the experimental results show that the SCAE trained with HAT ensures that the model can maintain relatively high classification accuracy under the evasion attack and achieve similar classification accuracy to that of the original SCAE model on clean samples.

TI DIG: dual interaction and guidance network for salient object detection

AB The focus of salient object detection (SOD) research is to obtain rich and effective features for characterizing objects. Recent progress on SOD mainly aims at exploiting how to effectively extract and integrate multilevel object features in a SOD network. In some cases, existing approaches mainly consider the cross-layer or cross-modal information fusion in the decoder. What's more, they extract global context information from the last encoder layer and directly integrate them with outputs of each preceding layer, which pay less attention to refine the global context features and explore ways to overcome the scale variability of salient objects. These may limit the ability of the model to represent salient object to a certain extent. Based on this observation, we propose a novel Dual Interaction and Guidance module (namely DIG) for better leveraging the information of various encoder-outputs and global context information. Specifically, a Dual Interaction Module (DIM) is proposed to realize two-level-granularity feature interaction through a nested residual-like structure. According to the global context features, we design a Global Context Feature Enhancement (GCIE) and Global Guidance Module (GGM) to mine the deep information hidden in the original global information and effective guide feature fusion respectively. Embedding the DIG into a encode-decoder salient detection framework has greatly improved the characterization ability to salient objects. Through extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against most state-of-the-art algorithms.

DE Non-negative matrix factorization; Adaptive local structure learning;

AB In general, fully exploiting the local structure of the original data space can effectively improve the clustering performance of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Therefore, graph-based NMF algorithms have been widely studied and applied. However, traditional graph-based NMF methods generally employ predefined models to construct similarity graphs, so that the clustering results depend heavily on the quality of the similarity graph. Furthermore, most of these methods follow the ideal assumption that the importance of different features is equal in the process of learning the similarity matrix, which results in irrelevant features being valued. To alleviate the above issues, this paper develops an adaptive graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization with self-weighted learning (SWAGNMF) method. Firstly, the proposed method learns the similarity matrix flexibly and adaptively to explore the local structure of samples based on the assumption that data points with smaller distances should have a higher probability of adjacency. Furthermore, the self-weight matrix assigns different weights automatically according to the importance of features in the process of constructing similarity graph, i.e., discriminative features are assigned more significant weights than redundant features, which can effectively suppress irrelevant features and enhance the robustness of our model. Finally, considering the duality between samples and features, the proposed method is capable of exploring the local structures of both the data space and the feature space. An effective alternative optimization algorithm is proposed, and convergence is theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experiments on benchmark and synthetic datasets show that the proposed method outperforms compared state-of-the-art clustering methods.

ID ABNORMAL EVENT DETECTION; LOCALIZATION
AB Automatic detection and interpretation of abnormal events have become crucial tasks in large-scale video surveillance systems. The challenges arise from the lack of a clear definition of abnormality, which restricts the usage of supervised methods. To this end, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method, Spatio-Temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STemGAN). This framework consists of a generator and discriminator that learns from the video context, utilizing both spatial and temporal information to predict future frames. The generator follows an Autoencoder (AE) architecture, having a dual-stream encoder for extracting appearance and motion information, and a decoder having a Channel Attention (CA) module to focus on dynamic foreground features. In addition, we provide a transfer-learning method that enhances the generalizability of STemGAN. We use benchmark Anomaly Detection (AD) datasets to compare the performance of our approach with the existing state-of-the-art approaches using standard evaluation metrics, i.e., AUC (Area Under Curve) and EER (Equal Error Rate). The empirical results show that our proposed STemGAN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods achieving an AUC score of 97.5% on UCSDPed2, 86.0% on CUHK Avenue, 90.4% on Subway-entrance, and 95.2% on Subway-exit.

AB Social relationships (SRs) are the basis of human life. Hence, the ability to accurately recognize interpersonal relations in public spaces based on visual observations helps policymakers improve mental health programs and address social challenges. The key to image-based computer-vision research on SR recognition (SRR) is a deep-learning mechanism that can predict SRs based on the contents of visual scenery images. Current methods explore logical constraints using relatively simple scenes with small groups of people. However, this is insufficient when desiring to form relation graphs of multiple groups simultaneously from complex scenes. Generally, complex scenes contain a principal relationship that applies to the largest proportion of people, and secondary relationships apply to smaller proportions. To effectively explore relational situations in complex scenes, we propose a new distributed reasoning strategy that accounts for principal and secondary SRs. First, our novel model enhances principal relation component reasoning, and a new contrastive learning algorithm supplements the principal relationship with secondary types. A shifted-window transformer is applied to extract interactive human relation features and local-global features to support more accurate and comprehensive relation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each part of the proposed model improves the accuracy of SRR and that the whole model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.

AB Motivated by real-world applications such as recommendation systems and social networks where only "likes" or "friendships" are observed, we consider a challenging multi-label learning problem where the observed label consists only of positive and unlabeled entries and the feature matrix contains missing entries. The problem is an enhanced instance of PU (positive-unlabeled) learning. Due to highly incomplete data, traditional multi-label learning algorithms are not directly available in such a scenario. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional matrix completion approach that exploits the matrix low-rank property to recover missing feature entries and label entries. Specifically, we introduce a low-rank co-embedding framework that integrates a low-rank matrix complete model and prediction model to jointly recover missing entries. In our framework, the prediction model can be conducted efficiently by dividing the low-rank matrix into a part capturing feature information and a part capturing information outside the feature space. Furthermore, we incorporate label embedding and graph regularized embedding together to improve matrix completion performance, which not only takes feature graph-structured information into account but also simultaneously exploits label semantic structured information. We provide an efficient alternative minimization scheme to solve the proposed problem. The experiments on transductive and inductive incomplete multi-label learning demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

AB Visual tracking is a key component of computer vision and has a wide range of practical applications. Recently, the tracking-by-segmentation framework has been widely applied in visual tracking due to its astonishing performance on accuracy. It attempts to learn from the framework of video object segmentation to realize accurate tracking. Although segmentation-based trackers are effective for target scale estimation, the segmentation network makes the trackers have high requirements for the extracted target features due to the need for pixel-level segmentation. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel feature representation and aggregation network and introduce it into the tracking-by-segmentation framework to extract and integrate rich features for accurate and robust segmentation tracking. To be specific, firstly, the proposed approach models three complementary feature representations, including contextual semantic, local position, and structural patch feature representations, through cross-attention, cross-correlation and dilated involution mechanisms respectively. Secondly, these features are fused by a simple feature aggregation network. Thirdly, the fusion features are fed into the segmentation network to obtain accurate target state estimation. In addition, to adapt the segmentation network to the appearance changes and partial occlusion, we introduce a template update strategy and a bounding box refinement module for robust segmentation and tracking. The extensive experimental results on twelve challenging tracking benchmarks show that the proposed tracker outperforms most of the state-of-the-art trackers and achieves very promising tracking performance on the OTB100 and VOT2018 benchmarks.

TI Generalized Ordered Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means Clustering Algorithm

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB The problem of ordered clustering in the context of decision-making with multiple criteria has garnered significant interest from researchers in the field of management science and operational research. In real-world scenarios, the datasets often exhibit imprecision or uncertainty, which can lead to suboptimal ordered-clustering outcomes. However, the intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (IFCM) clustering algorithm enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of decision-making processes by effectively handling uncertain dataset information for clustering. Therefore, we propose a new clustering algorithm, called the generalized ordered intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (G-OIFCM), based on PROMETHEE and the IFCM clustering algorithm. Different from the classical IFCM clustering algorithm, we use positive flow (phi+si is an element of 0, 1) and negative flow (phi-si is an element of 0, 1) of PROMETHEE to generate ordered clusters within the intuitionistic environment. We define a new objective function based on the positive and negative flow of the PROMETHEE and IFCM clustering algorithm, whose properties are mathematically justified in terms of convergence and optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using two different real-world datasets to assess both the ordered clustering and the quality of partitioning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of G-OIFCM, a comparison is conducted with three other algorithms: fuzzy c-means (FCM), ordered fuzzy c-means (OFCM), and an adaptive generalized intuitionistic fuzzy c-means (G-IFCM). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of G-OIFCM in enhancing optimal ordered clustering and utility when dealing with uncertainty in datasets.

AB Let G be a group with identity e and R be a graded commutative multiplicative hyperring. In this article, we study the notion of graded fuzzy multiplicative hyperrings as a generalization of fuzzy multiplicative hyperrings. In addition, we introduce and study the notion of graded fuzzy n-absorbing hyperideals of R as a generalization of fuzzy prime hyperideals. Many properties, examples and characterizations of graded fuzzy n-absorbing hyperideals of R are introduced. Moreover, among other results in this paper, we investigate graded fuzzy strongly n-absorbing hyperideals, graded fuzzy weakly completely n-absorbing hyperideals and graded fuzzy k-n-absorbing hyperideals. We obtain some basic properties and new results of this case of structures.

AB Tennis has gained global popularity, prompting a surge in interest towards 3D video-based tennis motion recognition. Early action recognition, which predates activity completion, is a critical classification task to preempt adverse outcomes. Prior research emphasizes effective feature extraction and modeling for swift, accurate classification, despite limited data availability. To establish a robust foundation, this study introduces an anticipatory action prediction module preceding the recognition component. The module forecasts subsequent motions based on observed ones, using an LSTM-GAN structure to mitigate motion blurring and generate predictions. This paper presents an innovative framework that leverages deep learning, particularly dilated neural networks, for real-time spatio-temporal tennis analysis on standard hardware, aiming to enhance player performance insights and action prediction through TensorFlow. The dilated RNN and CNN are integrated into the recognition module for comprehensive spatiotemporal feature modeling. To foster synergy between the prediction and recognition modules, a hard class mining mechanism is devised to enhance the learning capabilities of challenging class samples. As a result, the LSTM architecture combined with GAN provides an excellent 92.1 Precision, 91.2 Recall, 94.5 F-1 score and 95.0 Accuracy in action recognition and prediction of tennis sport, which is significantly higher than classical models i.e. GAN, Conv3DJ, Co-occurrence LSTM, and GAN + L1 + Mining.

AB Analog compute-in-memory (CIM) systems are promising candidates for deep neural network (DNN) inference acceleration. However, as the use of DNNs expands, protecting user input privacy has become increasingly important. Herein, a potential security vulnerability is identified wherein an adversary can reconstruct the user's private input data from a power side-channel attack even without knowledge of the stored DNN model. An attack approach using a generative adversarial network is developed to achieve high-quality data reconstruction from power leakage measurements. The analyses show that the attack methodology is effective in reconstructing user input data from power leakage of the analog CIM accelerator, even at large noise levels and after countermeasures. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, an example of CIM inference of U-Net for brain tumor detection is attacked, and the original magnetic resonance imaging medical images can be successfully reconstructed even at a noise level of 20% standard deviation of the maximum power signal value. This study highlights a potential security vulnerability in emerging analog CIM accelerators and raises awareness of needed safety features to protect user privacy in such systems.

ID 3-D MEASUREMENT METHOD; EXTRINSIC CALIBRATION; ALIGNMENT
AB Three dimensional (3D) robot measurement systems, with binocular planar structured light cameras (3D cameras) installed at the terminal flange of robots, are widely used to measure complete workpieces by stitching point clouds obtained from various sampled poses. To ensure accurate stitching, hand-eye calibration is necessary. However, 3D cameras often demonstrate low precision in measuring jumping edges and vertices, resulting in challenges when selecting appropriate calibrators and calibration methods for hand-eye calibration. We propose a simple and high-precision hand-eye calibration method for 3D robot measurement systems. Initially, a single sphere is utilized as the calibrator, and its poses are observed using specific robotic motions. Subsequently, the hand-eye calibration problem is formulated as a well-known equation, AX=XB$A X = X B$, relying solely on the high-precision relative pose of the robot. Finally, a novel simultaneous solution for AX=XB$A X = X B$ and the corresponding closed-form initial solution are introduced. Simulations and experiments confirm that the proposed method exhibits high noise resistance and achieves high-precision calibration, even with a limited calibration data quantity. Compared with traditional methods, the fitting error of the proposed method can be reduced from over 0.9 mm to less than 0.6 mm.
   To tackle the hand-eye calibration challenge in 3D robot measurement systems, this study proposes a straightforward calibration method that employs a single sphere. This method demonstrates high calibration accuracy, minimal data quantity requirements, and remarkable noise tolerance compared to traditional methods.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB In wireless communication technology, wireless sensor networks usually need to collect and process information in very harsh environment. Therefore, accurate positioning of sensors becomes the key to wireless communication technology. In this study, Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) algorithm was combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to reduce the influence of distance estimation error on positioning accuracy by using the characteristics of PSO iterative optimization. From the experimental results, among the average precision (AP) values of DFP, PSO, and PSO-DFP algorithms, the AP value of PSO-DFP was 0.9972. In the analysis of node positioning error, the maximum node positioning error of PSO-DFP was only about 21 mm. The results showed that the PSO-DFP algorithm had better performance, and the average positioning error of the algorithm was inversely proportional to the proportion of anchor nodes, node communication radius, and node density. In conclusion, the wireless sensor node location algorithm combined with PSO-DFP has a better location effect and higher stability than the traditional location algorithm.

The UVS system is particularly optimized towards precision and robustness, as well as lifelong operations. We build upon Oriented features from accelerated segment test and Rotated Binary robust independent elementary features simultaneous localization and mapping (ORB-SLAM) and improve the accuracy by performing an exact search in the descriptor space during triangulation and the robustness by utilizing a unified initialization method and a motion model. In addition, we present a scale-agnostic station-keeping detection, which aims to optimize the map and poses during station-keeping, and a pruning strategy, which takes into account the point's age and distance to the active keyframe. An exhaustive evaluation is presented to the reader, using a total of 38 in-air and underwater sequences.

AB For semantic segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance image (MRI) with low recognition and high background noise, a fusion-attention Swin Transformer is proposed based on cognitive science and deep learning methods. It has a U-shaped symmetric encoding-decoding structure with an attention-based skip connection. The encoder realizes self-attention for deep feature representation and the decoder up-samples global features to the corresponding input resolution for pixel-level segmentation. By introducing a skip connection between the encoder and decoder based on fusion attention, the remote interaction of global information is realized, and the attention to local features and specific channels is enhanced. A public ACDC cardiac MRI image dataset is used for experiments. The segmentation of the left ventricle, right ventricle, and myocardial layer is realized. The method performs well on a small sample dataset, for example, the pixel accuracy obtained by the proposed model is 93.68%, the Dice coefficient is 92.28%, and HD coefficient is 11.18. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, the segmentation precision has been significantly improved, especially for the low recognition and heavily occluded targets.

AB In this paper, the parameterisation tool of soft set theory is focused and factor sets are defined for all factors that can affect each parameter. Thus, more ideal results are aimed by determining the membership values of the parameters in uncertain environments. In addition, some new hybrid types of soft sets have been defined. The most important advantage of these new hybrid mathematical tools is that they can reduce the possible error margin of decision-makers. Moreover, a decision-making algorithm has been proposed for the set type that can bring us to the most comprehensive data on uncertainty. Finally, the solution to an uncertainty problem is obtained by using the given algorithm.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Efficacious forecasting of a solid waste supervision system depends on the prediction accuracy of solid waste generation. Several existing methods on municipal solid waste prediction were suggested previously, but those methods do not accurately predict the solid waste, and also it takes high computation time. To overwhelm these issues, Municipal Solid Waste Prediction using Tree Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network optimised with Balancing Composite Motion Optimization algorithm (MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA) is proposed for municipal solid waste prediction. Initially, real-time solid waste prediction data is taken from Quantity of MCC, Landfill, Gardan Garbage and Coconut Shell Report in Tamil Nadu (Chennai), such as Zone-9 (Nungambakkam), Zone 10 (Kodambakkam) and Zone 13 (Adyar). Then the collected solid waste data are pre-processed using morphological filtering and extended empirical wavelet transformation. Then the pre-processed data are given to THDCNN-BCMOA algorithm, which accurately predicts the solid waste as wet waste, dry waste, horticulture waste, and dumping yard for 2025-2035 years. The proposed MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA method is implemented in Python. Then the proposed MSWP-THDCNN-BCMOA method attains 17.91%, 28.30%, 5.63% and 13.54% higher accuracy, 98.66%, 99.13%, 96.43% and 98.31% lower error rate, 53.003%, 48.44%, 25.69% and 42.42% lower computation time compared with existing methods.

AB In the family traveling salesman problem (FTSP), there is a set of cities which are divided into a number of clusters called families. The salesman has to find a shortest possible tour visiting a specific number of cities from each of the families without any restriction of visiting one family before starting the visit of another one. In this work, the general concept of the Partial OPtimization Metaheuristic Under Special Intensification Conditions is linked with the exact optimization by a classical solver using a mathematical programming formulation for the FTSP to develop a matheuristic. Moreover, a genetic and a simulated annealing algorithm are used as metaheuristics embedded in the approach. The method is examined on a set of benchmark instances and its performance is favorably compared with a state-of-the-art approach from literature. Moreover, a careful analysis of the specific components of the approach is undertaken to provide insights into the impact of their interplay.

TI Living with AI personal assistant: an ethical appraisal
SO AI & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Artificial intelligence; Human interaction with AI; Virtue ethics;
   Friendly AI
AB Mark Coeckelbergh (Int J Soc Robot 1:217-221, 2009) argues that robot ethics should investigate what interaction with robots can do to humans rather than focusing on the robot's moral status. We should ask what robots do to our sociality and whether human-robot interaction can contribute to the human good and human flourishing. This paper extends Coeckelbergh's call and investigate what it means to live with disembodied AI-powered agents. We address the following question: Can the human-AI interaction contribute to our moral development? We present an empirically informed philosophical analysis of how the AI personal assistant Siri changes its users' way of life, based on the responses obtained from 20 semi-directive individual interviews with Siri users. We identify changes in the users' social interaction associated with the adoption of Siri. These changes include: (1) the indirect effect of reducing opportunities of human interaction, (2) the second-order effect of diminished expectations toward each other in a community, and (3) the acquired preference to obtain hassle-free interaction with Siri over human interaction. We examine them in relation to concerns that are voiced in the current debates over the rise of AI, namely the suspicion that humans could become overly reliant on AI (Danaher 2019) and the worry that social AI could impede on moral development (Froding and Peterson, Ethics Inf Technol 23:207-214, 2012; Li, Ethics Inf Technol 23:543-550, 2021). We analyze the ethical costs that come from these changes in light of virtue ethics and address potential objections along the way. We end by offering directions for thinking about how to live with AI personal assistant while preserving favorable conditions for moral development.

AB Cluster analysis is a crucial issue in multivariate statistics and data science due to its application in various fields. This study proposes a cutting-edge clustering algorithm for image data with important improvements. First, we extract the texture features from each image and represent them as two-dimensional intervals, which serve as effective input data for recognizing similarities between images. Subsequently, we introduce a measure called overlap distance for evaluating the similarity between intervals in multi-dimensional cases. Furthermore, the study develops an automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm specifically designed for images. This algorithm addresses multiple challenges simultaneously, including determining the appropriate number of clusters, identifying specific elements within clusters, and estimating the probability of each element belonging to clusters. In addition, the study implements a Matlab program to test the effectiveness and practical applications of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained from the proposed algorithm outperform those of current methods when applied to datasets with variations in the number of elements, fields, and characteristics of images.

AB Phase synchronization is an important mechanism for the information processing of neurons in the brain. Most of the current phase synchronization measures are bivariate and focus on the synchronization between pairs of time series. However, these methods do not provide a full picture of global interactions in neural systems. Considering the prevalence and importance of multivariate neural signal analysis, there is an urgent need to quantify global phase synchronization (GPS) in neural networks. Therefore, we propose a new measure named symbolic phase difference and permutation entropy (SPDPE), which symbolizes the phase difference in multivariate neural signals and estimates GPS according to the permutation patterns of the symbolic sequences. The performance of SPDPE was evaluated using simulated data generated by Kuramoto and Rossler model. The results demonstrate that SPDPE exhibits low sensitivity to data length and outperforms existing methods in accurately characterizing GPS and effectively resisting noise. Moreover, to validate the method with real data, it was applied to classify seizures and non-seizures by calculating the GPS of stereoelectroencephalog-raphy (SEEG) data recorded from the onset zones of ten epilepsy patients. We believe that SPDPE will improve the estimation of GPS in many applications, such as EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, brain modeling, and simultaneous EEG-fMRI analysis. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The timely identification of cardiovascular diseases is critical for effective intervention, with the electrocardiogram (ECG) serving as a pivotal diagnostic tool. Recent advancements in deep learning -based methods have significantly enhanced the accuracy of ECG signal classification. In clinical settings, cardiologists rely on diagnoses derived from standardized 12-lead ECG recordings. It must be acknowledged that there is considerable redundancy in the 12-lead ECG recordings used for ECG signal classification, thereby hindering their generalization capabilities. Meanwhile, considering multi-scale features in 12-lead ECG recordings is a crucial aspect that is often overlooked by existing methods. Based on the above observations, we develop a multi-scale Convolutional Transformer network for ECG signal classification. By utilizing learnable Convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks and novel dual-branch Transformer encoders, the proposed network automatically extracts features at different scales, resulting in superior feature representation. Additionally, by discarding low-importance patches and focusing on high-importance patches, we effectively alleviate information redundancy in the 12 -lead ECG recordings. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three commonly used ECG datasets. The Research results show that our proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks in multiple tasks.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge Graph (KG) is widely used for recommendation tasks due to its rich semantic information and external structure. Current knowledge graph recommendation models are insufficient for the learning of user-item interactive behaviors as well as external knowledge, and ignore the noise information in KG. To alleviate these limitations, we present a Collaborative Relation-aware Attention Network with Differentiable sampling (DCRAN) that can fully learn user-item interactions and knowledge graphs, and accurately select recommendation-related entities in KG. Specifically, DCRAN explicitly learns the embeddings of users and items and encodes them into collaborative interaction signals, which are used as guidance signals to extract knowledge. Furthermore, DCRAN emphasizes the importance of KG relations and constructs a relation-aware attention network to learn the representation of items in KG. Most importantly, DCRAN applies a differentiable sampling strategy on entities, which can reduce triplets that have a negative effect on recommendation. Experimental results on three public datasets manifest the effectiveness of DCRAN.

DE Correspondence matching; 3D computer vision; Deep learning;
   Convolutional neural networks; Epipolar constraints
AB Accurate and robust correspondence matching is of utmost importance for various 3D computer vision tasks. However, traditional explicit programming-based methods often struggle to handle challenging scenarios, and deep learning-based methods require large well-labeled datasets for network training. In this article, we introduce Epipolar-Constrained Cascade Correspondence (E3CM), a novel approach that addresses these limitations. Unlike traditional methods, E3CM leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks to match correspondence, without requiring annotated data for any network training or fine-tuning.

AB Expensive multiobjective optimization problem has been thoroughly studied in the past few years. However, one type of problem is often overlooked. Still, it is common in practice, whose partial target functions (objectives and constraints) are expensive that require approximations by surrogate models, while others have explicit formulas that can calculate immediately. To address this problem, a general representation is first defined as a highly heterogeneous optimization problem (HHOP) in this work. In terms of bi-objective constrained HHOP, an algorithm is proposed based on the Kriging surrogate model with a new exact 2-D expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) calculation method and a new constraint handling approach considering both the expensive and inexpensive target functions. In EHVI calculation, the integral is only performed in the expensive objective dimension due to the deterministic of the inexpensive objective, resulting in the reduction of the time complexity and increase of the accuracy. Combining a multiobjective and a dominance-based constraint handling approaches, a new constraint handling strategy is proposed to deal with the constrained HHOP specifically. The effectiveness of the proposed EHVI calculation method and constraint handling strategy is verified by the benchmark comparison problems. whose results also indicate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with the other state-of-art algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is implemented for a head sheave optimization problem to demonstrate its practicability in real-world problems.

AB Cognitive flexibility encompasses the ability to efficiently shift focus and forms a critical component of goal-directed attention. The neural substrates of this process are incompletely understood in part due to difficulties in sampling the involved circuitry. We leverage stereotactic intracranial recordings to directly resolve local-field potentials from otherwise inaccessible structures to study moment to-moment attentional activity in children with epilepsy performing a flexible attentional task. On an individual subject level, we employed deep learning to decode neural features predictive of task performance indexed by single-trial reaction time. These models were subsequently aggregated across participants to identify predictive brain regions based on AAL atlas and FIND functional network parcellations. Through this approach, we show that fluctuations in beta (12-30 Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) power reflective of increased top-down attentional control and local neuronal processing within relevant large-scale networks can accurately predict single-trial task performance. We next performed connectomic profiling of these highly predictive nodes to examine task-related engagement of distributed functional networks, revealing exclusive recruitment of the dorsal default mode network during shifts in attention. The identification of distinct substreams within the default mode system supports a key role for this network in cognitive flexibility and attention in children. Furthermore, convergence of our results onto consistent functional networks despite significant inter subject variability in electrode implantations supports a broader role for deep learning applied to intracranial electrodes in the study of human attention.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dynamic scheduling has received widespread attention from academia and industry due to the increasing complexity in manufacturing systems. Highly dynamic and adaptable behaviours are necessary for an improved production efficiency in unstable and constantly changing environments. This paper proposes an agent-based hybrid tabu-search heuristic (AB-TSH) to solve dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problems. The solution is fully implemented and tested in an industrial environment for seven distinct dynamic scenarios derived from a static scenario using the benchmark of AIP-PRIMECA Flexible Manufacturing System. The scheduling plan is obtained by exploitation using a greedy heuristic on tabu search solution points. The hybrid tabusearch heuristic is supported by a multi-agent system that react and re-optimize the scheduling plan in case of disturbances and unpredicted events. The proposed solution demonstrated superior performance in terms of makespan in the majority of dynamic scenarios tested when compared to previous studies in the literature. This improved performance is attributed to the solution's ability to combine the scheduling plan both statically and dynamically.

AB This study addresses the challenges of the electric vehicle routing problem with time windows, backup batteries, and battery swapping stations (EVRPTW-BB-BSS), reflecting complex issues in modern logistics. We treat each problem as an optimization task. Our main goal is to optimize various types of tasks at the same time. To achieve this, we present the double-assistant evolutionary multitasking algorithm (DAEMTA). This algorithm skillfully combines internal and external knowledge exchange. It helps in the transfer between different and similar types of tasks. DAEMTA includes a two-stage system for collaboration and adaptive methods for managing knowledge transfer. A population enhancement strategy deepens the search for valuable solutions. It also maintains diversity to avoid early convergence. Our experiments show that DAEMTA performs better than advanced EMTAs and traditional algorithms. We test it on 30 multitasking EVRPTW-BB-BSSs and four real-world problems. These findings highlight the practicality and effectiveness of our approach.

DE Surface electromyography; Feature learning; Gesture recognition;
   Transformer; Self-attention; Temporal depthwise convolution
AB Considerable progress has been made in pattern recognition of surface electromyography (sEMG) with deep learning, bringing improvements to sEMG-based gesture classification. Current deep learning techniques are mainly based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and their hybrids. However, CNNs focus on spatial and local information, while RNNs are unparallelizable, and they suffer from gradient vanishing/exploding. Their hybrids often face problems of model complexity and high computational cost. Because sEMG signals have a sequential nature, motivated by the sequence modeling network Transformer and its self-attention mechanism, we propose a Transformer-based network, temporal depthwise convolutional Transformer (TDCT), for sparse sEMG recognition. With this network, higher recognition accuracy is achieved with fewer convolution parameters and a lower computational cost. Specifically, this network has parallel capability and can capture long-range features inside sEMG signals. We improve the locality and channel correlation capture of multi-head self-attention (MSA) for sEMG modeling by replacing the linear transforma-tion with the proposed temporal depthwise convolution (TDC), which can reduce the convolution parameters and computations for feature learning performance. Four sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB1, DB2, DB5, and OYDB, are used for evaluations and comparisons. In the results, our model outperforms other methods, including Transformer-based networks, in most windows at recognizing the raw signals of sparse sEMG, thus achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy.

SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Traffic data imputation; Graph-based convolutions; Recurrent structures;
   Residual optimization
AB Performing accurate and efficient traffic data repair has become an essential task before proceeding with other applications of intelligent transportation systems. However, existing repair models often impose assumptions on the underlying data generation process or fail to sufficiently capture the complex spatial-temporal dependencies between several nodes at different intervals. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-stage deep residual collaboration learning framework (named Multi-DRCF) to tackle the complex task of repairing missing traffic data. In particular, a spatiotemporal fusion network (i.e., ST-imputator) incorporating the graph-based convolutions with recurrent structures is introduced for modeling the spatial topology and dynamic temporal coherences of the traffic graph network in turn. Moreover, to further achieve both higher accuracy and efficiency, we exploit a stackable bi-directional residual optimization (i.e., Bi-RO) structure to enhance the role of ST-imputator in the utilization of the spatiotemporal properties of the residuals. Indeed, this combination of ST-imputator and Bi-RO structure can serve as an iterable unit for Multi-DRCF, and the whole computation process is highly modular and flexible in operation. We evaluate Multi-DRCF using two real-world large-scale traffic speed datasets, i.e., Seattle-Loop and METR-LA. Experimental results demonstrate that Multi-DRCF can effectively extract the spatial and temporal properties from traffic data, resulting in an excellent repair performance with an acceptable computational cost. Compared with the state-of-the-art baseline models, Multi-DRCF performs more competitively for three types of missing patterns, and also provides steadier repair results with missing rates ranging from 10% to 90%. Finally, the ablation experiments and visualization analysis also present well insights for better understanding the superiority of the Multi-DRCF for complex spatial-temporal traffic data imputation.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

The scalability, geographic distribution, and heterogeneity of edge computing nodes, as well as the diversity of users' expectations, have made optimal module placement, considering the maximum use of fog resources, a challenging optimization problem. This paper proposes a method based on distributed learning automata to reduce the search space by using the maximum capacity of fogs in a heterogeneous fog network. In this method, fog topology is mapped to a distributed learning automata. With the cooperation of the automaton in this DLA, the problem of module placement has been solved to reduce energy consumption and delay of applications. To evaluate the amount of energy consumption and the execution time of IoT applications, two single-objective cost functions for energy and delay and another single-objective function with simultaneous consideration of energy and delay have been used. The results indicate that the average efficiency of the proposed method is 15.99%, 18.21%, and 15.53%, respectively, compared to other methods.

AB Misunderstandings of preferences are ubiquitous in various types of conflicts, and such misperceptions often involve uncertainty due to the limited cognitive abilities and information asymmetry of decision-makers. This research proposes a novel hypergame analysis approach based on the graph model for conflict resolution to address challenging disputes involving unknown misunderstandings of preferences. Specifically, a first-level hypergame model with two decision-makers is intentionally developed in this study to handle the uncertainty of preference misunderstandings in conflicts. The logical definitions of stabilities in the first-level hypergame are put forward to portray various decision-making behaviors of stakeholders when facing the vagueness of preference misperceptions, and efficiently determine possible resolutions. Algebraic representations of stabilities are also designed for the first time to enhance the computational efficiency of hypergame analyses and facilitate the development of decision support systems. Furthermore, more general definitions of individual and overall equilibria and their algebraic representations are purposefully proposed within the first-level hypergame model. This allows the decision-makers involved in a conflict to hold stable under different solution concepts. Finally, this novel approach is applied to an environmental dispute to demonstrate its practicality in addressing real-world conflicts with uncertain misperceptions of preferences. The case study shows that the uncertainty of preference misunderstandings can affect the optimal strategy selections of decision-makers and result in changes to the equilibria or outcomes of conflicts.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural model for Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER). The proposed model uses encoder-decoder transformer architecture that is supported by additional pre/post-processing modules, to recognize the image of mathematical formula and convert it to a well-formed language. A novel pre-processing module based on domain prior knowledge is proposed to generate random pads around the formula's image to create more efficient feature maps and keeps all the encoder neurons active during the training process. Also, a new post-processing module is developed which uses a sliding window to extract additional position-based information from the feature map, that is proved to be useful in the recognition process. The recurrent decoder module uses the combination of feature maps and the additional position-based information, which takes advantage of a soft attention mechanism, to extract the formula context into the LaTeX well-formed language. Finally, a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) module processes the decoder output and tunes its results by sending proper feedbacks to the previous steps. The experimental results on im2latex100k benchmark dataset indicate that each devised pre/post-processing as well as the RL refinement module has a positive effect on the performance of the proposed model. The results also demonstrate the higher accuracy of the proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a key formalism in AI research nowadays. Claims are an inherent part of each argument; they substantially determine the structure of the abstract representation. Nevertheless, they are often not taken into account on the abstract level, which restricts the modeling capacities of AFs to problems that do not involve claims in the evaluation. In this work, we address this shortcoming and conduct a structural analysis of claim-based argumentation semantics utilizing claim -augmented argumentation frameworks (CAFs) which extend AFs by assigning a claim to each argument. Our main contributions are as follows: We first propose novel variants for preferred, naive, stable, semi-stable, and stage semantics based on claim-defeat and claim-set maximization, complementing existing CAF semantics. Among our findings is that for a certain subclass, namely well-formed CAFs, the different versions of preferred and stable semantics coincide, which is not the case for the other semantics. We then conduct a principle-based analysis of the semantics with respect to general and well -formed CAFs. Finally, we study the expressiveness of the semantics by characterizing their signatures. In summary, this paper provides a thorough analysis of fundamental properties of abstract argumentation semantics (along the lines of existing results for AFs) but from the perspective of the claims the arguments represent. This shift of perspective provides novel results which we deem relevant when abstract argumentation is used in an instantiation-based setting.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The performance of population-based meta-heuristic algorithms can be divided into two phases: exploitation and exploration. However, a major drawback of these methods is their inability to guarantee thorough searching of the entire search space. This is because the population (wolves) is randomly distributed and may not cover all areas in searching for the best solution. To address this issue, this paper introduces a simple technique called Repairable Grey Wolf Optimization (RGWO), which can be easily integrated into any population-based algorithm to enhance the exploration phase. The RGWO is implemented within the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) method and involves two main phases: elimination and search space management. In the elimination phase, underperforming wolves are gradually replaced with new ones, and new design parameters are introduced to improve the control of exploitation and exploration. In the search space management phase, instead of initially spreading the wolves across the entire search space, they are concentrated in a small portion and gradually expand from there. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, an extensive comparative study was conducted, comparing it with various classic and state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. The results demonstrate several advantages over existing techniques, including fast convergence and high robustness.

AB To reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data and enhance its classification accuracy, feature selection can be regarded as a multiobjective optimization problem that can be addressed by evolutionary computation algorithms with promising results. However, balancing the convergence and diversity of nondominated solutions remains challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multiobjective sparrow search feature selection approach with sparrow ranking and preference information and its applications for high-dimensional data. First, during the population updating process, the updating formula of observers is combined with the mutualism phase of the symbiotic organisms search algorithm to design a location updating formula of observers in the sparrow search algorithm, balancing the local development ability and global search ability of sparrow search algorithm and increasing the possibility of moving closer to the optimal solution. Second, based on the dominant and nondominated sparrow individuals of each sparrow, the dominant and nondominated distances are defined, and the sparrow ranking is proposed. The feature ranking is then designed by using the definition of sparrow ranking. Following the definition of sparrow ranking and feature ranking, the selection strategy and location updating formula of the producers in the sparrow search algorithm are proposed. Finally, a preference information-based mutation algorithm is designed to augment the diversity of the nondominated solutions and more effectively guide the whole sparrow population to a better solution. The experimental results on 14 high-dimensional datasets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms different single-objective and multiobjective optimization feature selection algorithms in terms of classification efficiency and diversity of solutions.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

   information; Reward shaping; Unbiased reward function
AB Adversarial imitation learning (AIL) is a powerful method for automated decision systems due to training a policy efficiently by mimicking expert demonstrations. However, implicit bias is present in the reward function of these algorithms, which leads to sample inefficiency. To solve this issue, an algorithm, referred to as Mutual Information Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (MI-GAIL), is proposed to correct the biases. In this study, we propose two guidelines for designing an unbiased reward function. Based on these guidelines, we shape the reward function from the discriminator by adding auxiliary information from a potential-based reward function. The primary insight is that the potential-based reward function provides more accurate rewards for actions identified in the two guidelines. We compare our algorithm with SOTA imitation learning algorithms on a family of continuous control tasks. Experiments results show that MI-GAIL is able to address the issue of bias in AIL reward functions and further improve sample efficiency and training stability.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Autonomous driving with active obstacle avoidance in dynamic urban environment has attracted significant attention to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. In this paper, an online optimization-based trajectory planning method for autonomous overtaking is developed to prevent collision and realize safe efficient driving. Unlike traditional methods which solve the overtaking problem with segmented reference path in multi-stages with integer variables, this paper proposes a novel dual-variable trajectory planning framework to get the optimal trajectory for active collision avoidance. First, the nonlinear non-differentiable collision-free constraint between vehicles is reformulated using dual problem optimization. Then, the optimal trajectory for longitudinal and lateral movement is obtained jointly in a receding horizon optimization framework based on the optimized dual variable considering the safety and dynamic performance. The key novelty lies in the reformulation of the nonlinear optimal trajectory planning problem and the formulated whole optimization framework can be solved using efficient open-source solvers for online computation. Simulation studies in different dynamic cases are provided to show the efficiency and robustness for safe driving. The method reaches safe overtaking performance with much less calculation time. Real-world experiment with a static obstacle demonstrates its capability for the safe efficient trajectory planning and online implementation in autonomous driving.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Small Infrared Target Detection (SITD) aims to separate the information of small targets from complex background clutter. Infrared radiation decays with distance, making the appearance information of small targets very limited and highly blurry, and easily submerging in complex background environments. Due to the fact that local areas similar to infrared dim and small targets which may spread throughout the entire background, it is crucial to mine the diversity differences between the target and background to obtain accurate target contrast information for robust detection. Therefore, a deep network framework that covers feature enhancement, interaction, and comparison is proposed in this thesis for SITD. Specially, the patch-based attention module is first designed to enhance the embedding of local context information from different layer features. Then, multi-granularity co-attention embedding modules are designed in a parallel manner to explore interactions and alignments at corresponding spatial locations in the cross-layer features, thus enhancing the consistent representation of small infrared targets. Next, hierarchical attention fusion module is constructed to discover the association and contrast among cross-layer aggregation features of three different granularity in corresponding spatial positions, thus highlighting the distinguishability between small targets and complex backgrounds with strong interference. Moreover, the optimization of multi-objective loss is designed not only to assist the feature learning of small targets on different layer space, but also to improve the distribution consistency of cross-layer aligned features. Extensive experiments on two publicly datasets and a constructed maritime dataset show that our method is effective and can achieve better detection effect compared with the current state-of-the-art methods.

TI Particle filter meets hybrid octrees: an octree-based ground vehicle

DE LiDAR; Particle filter; Real time; Off-road localization
AB This paper proposes an accurate lidar-based outdoor localization method that requires few computational resources, is robust in challenging environments (urban, off-road, seasonal variations) and whose performances are equivalent for two different sensor technologies: scanning LiDAR and flash LiDAR. The method is based on the matching between a pre-built 3D map and the LiDAR measurements. Our contribution lies in the combined use of a particle filter with a hybrid octree to reduce the memory footprint of the map and significantly decrease the computational load for online localization. The design of the algorithm allows it to run on both CPU and GPU with equivalent performance. We have evaluated our approach on the KITTI dataset and obtained good results compared to the state of the art. This paper introduces the baseline performance on a multi-seasonal dataset we are publicly releasing to the community. We have shown that the same localization algorithms and parameters can perform well in urban environments and can be extended to off-road environments. We have also evaluated the robustness of our method when masking angular sectors of the LiDAR field of view to reproduce edge-cases scenarios in urban environments where the LiDAR field is partially occulted by another vehicle (bus, truck). Finally, experiments have been carried out with two distinctive scanning and flash LiDAR technologies. The performance achieved with the flash LiDAR is close to the scanning LiDAR despite different resolutions and sensing modalities. The positioning performance is significant with 10cm and 0.12 degrees angular RMSE for both technologies. We validated our approach in an off-road environment from a front view field of view with only 768 LiDAR points.

ID KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION
AB With the development of neural networks, more and more complex and excellent relation classification models are constantly proposed. Although they can be compressed by some model compression methods at the cost of effectiveness, they are still insufficient to deploy on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge distillation can transfer the excellent predictive abilities of superior models to lightweight models, but the gap between models limits its effects. Due to the huge gaps between relation classification models, it is painstakingly difficult to select and train a superior teacher model to guide student models when we use knowledge distillation to get a lightweight model. Therefore, how to obtain a lightweight relation classification model with high effectiveness is still a hot research topic. In this paper, we construct an alternate distillation framework with three modules. The weight adaptive external distillation module is built based on an adaptive weighting module based on cosine similarity. The progressive internal distillation module allows the model to be its own teacher to guide its own training. Finally, a combination module based on the attention mechanism combines the above two modules. On SemEval-2010 Task 8 and WiKi80 datasets, we demonstrate the great effect of our approach on improving the relation classification effectiveness of lightweight models.

DE Fall detection; Skeletal information; Genetic Algorithm; Feature
   selection; Performance-speed trade-off
AB With the decrease in mobility, falls have become more prevalent and painful for both men and women. Most current approaches for fall detection in daily living employ either simple thresholds or complex networks. However, these methods suffer from an inability to consider the association among data or the disadvantage of excessive complexity in practical use. In this paper, we propose a compromise workflow called FDGA for fall detection that addresses these issues. Our approach first roughly determines the bounding box of the fallen target using the lightweight Fall-ROI extraction, and then further determines the precise skeletal position using a fine top-down skeletal estimator. Additionally, the genetic-algorithm-based classifier minimizes the effect of redundant features. Since no heavy network is required, the proposed workflow maintains an excellent performance-speed trade-off. We validate our approach using two fall detection datasets and a new large-scale fall detection dataset we created. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

TI Self-supervised efficient sample weighting for multi-exit networks

DT Article
DE Sample weighting; Early-exit networks; Self-supervised; Efficient
   training
AB Dynamic sample weighting is an effective approach for improving the inference accuracy and efficiency of different classifiers in multi-exit networks. By bringing the early-exit behavior from testing to training, such a method allows input samples to contribute differently at each sub-network, reducing the gap between training and inference. Recent methods mainly rely on learning a weighting mechanism through reinforcement learning and meta-learning based frameworks jointly with the multi-exit models. However, additional data are usually needed and essential for these approaches, which results in more computation consumption and limits their general applicability. To address these two problems, we propose a Self-supervised Efficient Sample Weighting (SESW) method to predict weights for input samples based on their losses at each exit. We pose the problem as a self-supervised multi-class classification problem. The SESW module is trained to predict if the log-likelihood for the loss of each sample in the current training stage belongs to the most confident classifier. The results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and dynamic inference efficiency while achieving a significant improvement in training time.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper addresses the consensus problem of nonlinear multiagent systems with uncertainties and switching network topology under truncated prediction feedback approach subjected to periodic scaling attacks. Here, a type of deception attack known as periodic scaling attack have been taken into consideration for both undirected and directed graphs during agent's communication. The fundamental purpose of this paper is to develop a state feedback controller that can withstand actuator faults while ensuring the resultant closed loop systems. Furthermore, the truncated prediction feedback approach is utilized for handling input delays and then, a set of necessary conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities by developing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Eventually, to demonstrate the significance of the established theoretical results, two numerical simulation are conferred.

AB Uncertainty measures exhibit algebraic and informational perspectives, and the two-view measure integration facilitates feature selections in classification learning. According to neighborhood decision systems (NDSs), two basic algorithms of feature selections (called JE-FS and DE-FS) already exist by using joint and decisional entropies, respectively, but they have advancement space for informationally fusing algebraic measures. In this paper on NDSs, three-way fusion measures are systematically constructed by combining three-way algebraic and informational measures, and thus three-level feature selections are hierarchically investigated by using corresponding monotonic and nonmonotonic measures and strategies. At first, the accuracy, granularity, and composite granularityaccuracy constitute three-way algebraic measures, while the joint, conditional, and decisional entropies (JE, CE, DE) formulate three-way informational measures. Then, three-way algebraic and informational measures are combined via normalization and multiplication, so three-way fusion measures based on JE, CE, DE are established. These new measures acquire granulation monotonicity and nonmonotonicity. Furthermore by relevant measures and monotonicity/nonmonotonicity, three-level feature selections (with null, single, and double fusion levels) related to JE, CE, DE are proposed, and corresponding heuristic algorithms are designed by monotonic and nonmonotonic principles. 4 x 3 = 12 selection algorithms comprehensively emerge, and they extend and improve current JE-FS and DE-FS. Finally by data experiments, related uncertainty measures and granulation properties are validated, and all 12 selection algorithms are compared in classification learning. As a result, new algorithms outperform JE-FS and DE-FS for classification performance, and the algorithmic improvements accord with the fusion-hierarchical deepening and entropy-systematic development of uncertainty measures.

AB Flooding is one of the most common natural hazards that have extremely detrimental consequences. Understanding which areas are vulnerable to flooding is crucial to addressing these effects. In this work, we use machine learning models and Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems for flood susceptibility mapping in Kerala, India. In particular, we used a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this purpose. The CNN model was assisted with hyperparameter opti-mization techniques that combine Bayesian optimization with evolutionary algorithms like differential evolution and covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategies. The performances of all models are compared in terms of cross-entropy loss, accuracy, precision, recall, area under the curve (AUC) and kappa score. The CNN model shows better performance than the AutoML models. Evolutionary algorithm-assisted hyperparameter optimization methods improved the efficiency of the CNN model by 4 and 9 percent in terms of accuracy and by 0.0265 and 0.0497 with reference to the AUC score.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Many real-world multiple-objective optimization problems have objectives that change over time. These multiple-objective optimization problems are called dynamic multiple-objective optimization problems (DMOPs) and have received an increased attention. To track the changing Pareto front in DMOPs, the Pareto front at a certain moment needs to be obtained as efficiently as possible, which is challenging for most of existing methods. To this end, we propose a two-level parallel decomposition-based artificial bee colony method for solving DMOPs. To sufficiently accelerate the process of obtaining the Pareto front, a two-level parallel structure is designed in our method. In the first-level parallel structure, the dynamic multi-objective optimization problem at a certain moment is decomposed into a set of single-objective optimization problems that could be solved in parallel. In the second-level parallel structure, a parallel artificial bee colony algorithm is applied to solve each decomposed single -objective optimization problem. Specially, the parallel bee colony algorithm in our method is improved to support the exchange of information among neighbor problems, which is widely accepted to be effective in improving the efficiency of obtaining optimal solutions. To support the implementation of our improved parallel artificial bee colony algorithm, a two-level shared memory structure is designed. Our proposed method is compared with 4 widely used methods on CEC' 2018 multi-objective optimization benchmarks and two constrained dynamic multi-objective optimization problems. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other compared methods in efficiency while maintaining good scalability and convergence.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The real-time status monitoring and health management of aero-turbofan engines (ATEs) can effectively reduce the risk of engine failure and ensure aircraft flight safety. Accurate prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of ATE is a vital tool for effectively monitoring the engine operating condition, in which long-short term memory (LSTM) networks are often applied to RUL prediction. However, because of the complex mechanical structure and operation mode of the aero-engine, the prediction accuracy of the LSTM network is not enough to meet the actual demand. This paper proposes an auto-expandable cascaded long-short term memory (ACLSTM) prediction model that incorporates the lifetime variation laws of ATE, which is mainly applied for the degradation assessment of ATEs and the accurate prediction of RUL. The ACLSTM model adopts the network structure of multiple LSTM modules connected step by step to continuously set the prediction error of the previous module as the training outputs of the latter module. This data processing method transforms the prediction process of the original data into that of the output error, effectively reducing the prediction error and improving the prediction effect. In addition, to further improve the prediction accuracy, this paper comprehensively proposes several empirical formulas for further correction of the prediction effect obtained by the ACLSTM model. In the experimental part, the prediction effectiveness of the proposed method is tested based on four subsets of the C-MAPSS dataset published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The experimental results on the four datasets show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the ACLSTM prediction model decreases by 95.44% on average compared to the traditional LSTM network. In addition, the RMSE of the model decreases by 96.48% on average after incorporating the empirical formula. The proposed method has the lowest RMSE compared to other methods with the highest prediction accuracy. The experiments thoroughly verify that the ACLSTM model and the proposed empirical formula are feasible and effective for improving the prediction accuracy of the RUL of ATE.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB The cyber risk from malicious external attackers is a significant socio-economic problem. Cyber risk prediction is particularly difficult, given the constantly changing attack vectors. This study presents a model that automatically predicts cyber risks. The model is only based on common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) data and supervised prediction algorithms. This approach eliminates expert opinion bias in cyber risk prediction. Our supervised data-driven model, CyRiP red, CVE data into cyber risk groups by mapping the textual description field of the database into relevant Wikipedia article titles. Then CyRiP red aggregates the occurrence and severity of extracted topics for the desired time unit and produces a time series fed to supervised regressors for prediction. The risks are calculated using predicted occurrence and impact. Finally, the cyber risks are ranked by their score, and the top ten risks are presented. The proposed model is evaluated, and the results are discussed.

AB In the field of video captioning, recent works usually focus on multi-modal video content understanding, in which transcripts are extracted from speech and are often adopted as an informational supplement. However, most existing works only consider transcripts as a supplementary modality, neglecting their potential in capturing high-level semantics, such as multi-modal topics. In fact, transcripts, as a textual attribute derived from the video, reflect the same high-level topics as the video content. Nonetheless, how to resolve the heterogeneity of multi-modal topics is still under-investigated and worth exploring. In this paper, we introduce a contrastive topic-enhanced network to consistently model heterogeneous topics, that is, inject an alignment module in advance, to learn a comprehensive latent topic space and guide caption generation. Specifically, our method includes a local semantic alignment module and a global topic fusion module. In the local semantic alignment module, a fine-grained semantic alignment at the clip-sentence granularity reduces the semantic gap between modalities. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our solution.

AB Using the Mass Observation corpus of 12th of May Diaries, we investigate concepts that are characteristic of the first coronavirus lockdown in the UK. More specifically, we extract and analyse concepts which are distinctive of the discourses produced in May 2020 in relation to concepts used in the 10 previous years, 2010-2019. In the current paper we focus on the concept of regulation, which we identify through a novel approach to querying semantic content in large datasets. Typically, linguists look at keywords to understand differences between two datasets. We demonstrate that taking the perspective of a keyconcept rather than the keyword in linguistic analysis is a beneficial way of identifying trends in broader patterns of thoughts and behaviours which reflect lived-experiences that are particularly prominent of a given dataset, which, in this current paper, is the COVID-19 era dataset. In order to contextualise the keyconcept analysis, we investigate the discourses surrounding the concept of regulation. We find that diarists communicate collective experience of limited individual agency, surrounded by feelings of fear and gratitude. Diarists' reporting on events is often fragmented, focused on new information, and firmly placed in a temporal frame.

ID MODEL
AB Multi-contextualized representations learning is vital for named entity recognition (NER), which is a fundamental task for effectively extracting structured information from unstructured text, and forming knowledge bases. This task is particularly challenging when dealing with Chinese text given the absence of evident word boundaries. Chinese word segmentation (CWS) can be leveraged to recognize word boundaries, but named entities often encompass multiple segmented words, making it crucial to use boundary information to correctly recognize and distinguish the relationships between these words. In this paper, we propose MCA-NER, a multi- contextualized adversarial based attentional deep learning approach for Chinese NER, which combines CWS and part-of-speech (POS) tagging information with the classic BiLSTM-CRF NER model, using adversarial multi-task learning. The model incorporates several self-attention components for adversarial and multi-task learning, effectively synthesizing task-specific and common information attribution while improving performance across all three tasks.
   Experimental results on the three datasets provide compelling evidence that supports the effectiveness and performance of our model.

AB In the field of medicine, thermal image processing and analysis play a significant role in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases. For example, during the last decade, several studies have been performed based on thermal image processing for ocular disease diagnosis. This research proposes a unique approach for the classification of subgroups of two retinal vascular diseases, namely diabetic eye disease and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The class imbalance problem is a well-known issue when working with medical data, where one class is significantly less represented than another class in the dataset. To deal with the class imbalance issue, an ensemble decision tree classifier with a random under-sampling and adaptive boosting (RUSBoost) technique is proposed. The performance of the proposed classifier is compared with various traditional machine learning-based classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble tree outperforms other classifiers through high accuracy, F-score, and Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) values in classifying diabetic eye diseases and AMD diseases. The proposed ensemble decision tree distinguishes dry AMD and wet AMD over healthy controls with 95% average accuracy. Also, it classifies diabetic retinopathy (DR) with diabetic macular edema (DME) and DR without DME with 94% average accuracy. The classifier could distinguish dry and wet AMD which did not work around in temperature analysis on the manual temperature measurement. The performance of the automated classification model is on par with the performance of the temperature analysis of OST for DME and DR without DME.

AB Gene sequence classification can be seen as a challenging task due to the nonstationary, noisy and nonlinear characteristics of sequential data. The primary goal of this research is to develop a general solution approach for supervised DNA chromatogram (DNAC) classification in the absence of sufficient training data. Today, deep learning comes to the fore with its achievements, however this requires a lot of training data. Finding enough training data can be exceedingly challenging, particularly in the medical area and for rare disorders. In this paper, a novel supervised DNAC classification method is proposed, which combines three techniques to classify hepatitis virus DNA trace files as HBV and HCV. The features that are capable of reflecting the complex-structured sequential data are extracted based on both embedding and spectral entropies. After the supervised dimension reduction step, not only global behavior of the entropy features but also local behavior of the entropy features is taken into account for classification purpose. A memory-based learning, which cannot lose any information coming from training data as its nature, is being used as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good results that although 19% training data is used, a performance of 92% is obtained.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity due to their low lifecycle cost and minimal human risk, resulting in their widespread use in recent years. In the UAV swarm cooperative decision domain, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning has significant potential. However, current approaches are challenged by the multivariate mission environment and mission time constraints. In light of this, the present study proposes a meta-learning based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach that provides a viable solution to this problem. This paper presents an improved MAML-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm that achieves an unbiased initialization network by automatically assigning weights to meta-learning trajectories. In addition, a Reward-TD prioritized experience replay technique is introduced, which takes into account immediate reward and TD-error to improve the resilience and sample utilization of the algorithm. Experiment results show that the proposed approach effectively accomplishes the task in the new scenario, with significantly improved task success rate, average reward, and robustness compared to existing methods.

AB The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, originating in Wuhan, China, in 2019, has spread to over 200 countries, posing a significant burden on global health systems and the global economy. The urgent need for faster and more accessible diagnostic methods has become evident, especially in regions with limited resources. Early detection can help reduce the death rate and prevent the spread of disease between people. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests have been widely used as a reliable method for detecting the presence of the virus. However, PCR testing has its drawbacks, such as being time-consuming, expensive, and putting healthcare workers at risk due to close contact with patients. In response to these challenges, medical imaging techniques like X-rays have been utilized for COVID-19 screening due to their speed, safety, and wider availability compared to traditional methods. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into image processing has shown promising results in accurately distinguishing between normal and diseased chest radiographs, aiding in early diagnosis and patient management. In this study, we propose a deep learning model to analyze COVID-19 chest X-rays, aiming to address the limitations of PCR testing and enhance the efficiency of diagnosis. One of the major challenges faced in this research is the low amount of available data for training the deep learning model. The lack of comprehensive and well-labeled datasets hinders the model's ability to generalize effectively and may limit its performance. Despite this limitation, we aim to achieve the best possible results using the available data. The proposed method includes a preprocessing step to improve image quality, followed by lung segmentation using UNet to eliminate irrelevant data and improve learning. Data augmentation is applied to address the class imbalance, ensuring the model's generalization capability. The core of the system is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN), optimized for small training datasets and low computation cost, making it suitable for resource-limited devices and real-time applications. The classification performance of the proposed model is compared with widely-used CNN models, including DenseNet, ResNet, InceptionV3, VGG16, and VGG19. The results demonstrate the superiority of the lightweight CNN model in terms of computation cost and generalization, showing great promise for its practical implementations. This research contributes to advancing the diagnosis and medical decision support system of COVID-19 through deep learning techniques, particularly in regions where PCR testing is limited or not readily accessible. By providing a faster, reliable, and cost-effective alternative to PCR testing, the proposed method can aid in mitigating the spread of the virus and improve patient outcomes.

AB Untethered microrobotic grasping has enabled the precise manipulation of small components in difficult-to-reach environments. However, the fabrication of deformable grasping robots at small scales requires advanced materials and fabrication technologies. Alternatively, multiple microrobots can be used to surround and grasp objects. By collaborating, microrobots can perform complex tasks that they would not be capable of executing individually. The complexity of controlling multiple untethered microrobots has limited the applications of collaborative microrobots to two-dimensional operations. To fill this gap, this work proposes a collaborative microrobotic system for three-dimensional grasping operations. The system is based on the control of two magnetic agents and the exploitation of the magnetic interactions between them to grasp, manipulate, and assemble passive components. A custom-made closed-loop controller is developed to automatically stabilize the system, achieving pose control of a grasped passive component (of 2 mm in size) with a precision of 300 & mu;m in position and 10 & DEG; in orientation. The main advantage of the proposed system is its capability to reconfigure the magnetic agents for other operations, as demonstrated by the assembly of a microgear and subsequent reconfiguration to power the assembled mechanism.

AB Glioblastoma tumor recurrences often occur in brain tissue areas harboring infiltrating tumor cells, resembling healthy tissue in brain imaging. Demarcating infiltrative regions for aggressive resections is critical for improving prognostic outcomes but is challenging in neurosurgery. Herein, a multilayer sigmoid-activated convolutional neural network (MLS-CNN) is developed for rapidly distinguishing glioma tumor infiltration in brain tissue histology. Unlike conventional multiclass classifiers, the MLS-CNN employs sigmoidal activation to accommodate coexisting classes within patch images. 59 811 image patches (25 807 infiltrating edge, 15 178 normal brain, 18 826 cellular tumor) from 73 brain tissue samples are extracted to train the classifier. The model achieves an accuracy of 91.70% (sensitivity: 91.62%; specificity: 91.78%) and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.964 in distinguishing infiltrating edges, outperforming the current state-of-the-art Vision Transformer (ViT) (accuracy: 89.45; AUC: 0.947). The MLS-CNN is computationally efficient, generating predictions within 11.5 s in comparison to 81.4 s for ViT. The predictions strongly correlate with In Situ Hybridization expression intensities, validating the utility of the MLS-CNN model in spatial genomics investigations in gliomas. The robust model can therefore serve as an automatic and accurate classifier to help pathologists identify infiltrative glioma for better diagnosis and patient outcomes in brain oncology.

MLS-CNN achieves strong diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. MLS-CNN classifications are well correlated with gene expression levels in In Situ Hybridized images. A graphical user interface using MLS-CNN through intuitive prediction visualization facilitates bedside diagnosis to improve patient outcomes in brain oncology.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

AB Microbiome has emerged as a promising indicator or predictor of human diseases. However, previous studies have typically labeled each specimen as either healthy or with a specific disease, ignoring prevalence of complications or comorbidities in actual cohorts, which may confound the microbial-disease associations. For instance, a patient may suffer from multiple diseases, making it challenging to detect their health status accurately. Furthermore, host phenotypes like physiological characteristics and lifestyles can alter microbiome structure, but such information has not yet been fully utilized in data models. To address these issues, a highly explainable deep learning (DL) method called Meta-Spec is proposed. Using a deep neural network (DNN)-based approach, it encodes and embeds refined host variables with microbiome features, enabling the detection of multiple diseases simultaneously. Experiments show that Meta-Spec outperforms regular machine learning (ML) strategies for multilabel disease screening in several cohorts. More importantly, Meta-Spec successfully detects comorbidities that are often missed by other approaches. In addition, for its high interpretability, Meta-Spec captures key factors that shape disease patterns from host variables and microbes. Hence, these efforts improve the feasibility and sensitivity of microbiome-based disease screening in practical scenarios, representing a significant step toward personalized medicine and better health outcomes.
   Herein, Meta-Spec is presented, which is a highly explainable deep learning framework for microbiome-based multidisease detection.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) has recently gained popularity due to its applications in healthcare, surveillance, human-robot interaction, and various other fields. Deep learning (DL)-based models have been successfully applied to the raw data captured through inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to recognize multiple human activities. Despite the success of DL-based models in human activity recognition, feature extraction remains challenging due to class imbalance and noisy data. Additionally, selecting optimal hyperparameter values for DL models is essential since they affect model performance. The hyperparameter values of some of the existing DL-based HAR models are chosen randomly or through the trial-and-error method. The random selection of these significant hyperparameters may be suitable for some applications, but sometimes it may worsen the model's performance in others. Hence, to address the above-mentioned issues, this research aims to develop an optimized DL model capable of recognizing various human activities captured through IMU sensors. The proposed DL-based HAR model combines convolutional neural network (CNN) layers and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) units to simultaneously extract spatial and temporal sequence features from raw sensor data. The Rao-3 metaheuristic optimization algorithm has been adopted to identify the ideal hyperparameter values for the proposed DL model in order to enhance its recognition performance. The proposed DL model's performance is validated on PAMAP2, UCI-HAR, and MHEALTH datasets and achieved 94.91%, 97.16%, and 99.25% accuracies, respectively. The results reveal that the proposed DL model performs better than the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) models.

AB The estimation of geomechanical properties such as Young's modulus from well logs is a crucial task in the field of geomechanical engineering. Traditional methods for estimating these properties can be time-consuming and may not always provide accurate results. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been increasingly used for this purpose, providing a more efficient and accurate alternative. This paper focuses on the estimation of Young's modulus from well logs using machine learning techniques. The use of well logs as input data for machine learning models has several advantages, including the ability to handle large datasets, the identification of key input features, and the creation of predictive maps. Well logs from well 15/9_F_11A of Volve Field from a depth range 3575-3720 m are used for training the various ML algorithms mainly the support vector regression, linear regression, and decision tree and also for generating the synthetic Young's modulus. The well 15/9_F_1A of Volve Field is used for predicting Young's modulus. From the train-test results, decision tree has shown a test score of 0.97. The score metrics are calculated, and the decision tree has a MAPE of 0.034%, which is the least among the other ML algorithms used for prediction. The actual and predicted values of Young's modulus have shown good precision results. The model shows greater efficiency to analyse large amounts of well log data and presents a cost-effective solution to predict Young's modulus in wells which contain less information due to financial or technical reasons. Also, the stratigraphy of the training well and testing well is not completely similar, but the model has generated an R2 of 0.973 on the test well. Finally, the use of machine learning for estimating Young's modulus from well logs is proved to be a promising approach that can provide valuable insights and results for geomechanical engineering applications.

AB In mixed attribute clustering, the similarity measure superposition is skewed due to the difference of measuring different attribute types. In this paper, a new clustering approach for mixed attribute data is proposed using hybrid similarity measure. Firstly, a hybrid similarity measure formula is defined using the information entropy, therefore the similarity difference among various attribute types is effectively reduced, and the inclination of similarity measure superposition is alleviated. Secondly, a calculation formula of similarity mean for mixed attributes is defined, which can describe the centralized trend of data distribution, and can be effectively used to merge of clustering clusters. Thus, artificial setting of similarity threshold parameters can be avoided. Thirdly, a novel clustering analysis algorithm for mixed attributes is proposed using hybrid similarity measure and allocation strategy of boundary data objects. In the end, experimental results validate that the algorithm performs well on clustering effect, scalability and anti-noise, as well as the stability and effectiveness of the similarity mean by using UCI, artificial data sets and stellar spectral data sets.

AB Scenario-based techniques, also known as scenario methods, have been actively employed to resolve intricate problems for engineering complex software systems. Scenarios are powerful tools that allow engineers to analyze the dynamics and contexts of complex systems. Despite the widespread use, there is a lack of a well-established reference framework that systematically organizes key concepts and attributes of scenarios. This has left engineers without a systematic guidance at the method level, hindering their ability to utilize the scenario methods effectively. To address the challenges associated with scenario methods, this study aims to provide a reference framework and modeling method. By conducting a literature review and suggesting a Conceptual Scenario Framework (CSF), we establish a conceptual basis that systematically presents the core concepts and characteristics of scenarios. Additionally, we introduce the Extensible Scenario Modeling Method (ESMM) that empowers engineers to perform scenario modeling and domain-specific extensions using the framework. With the inclusion of the Extensible Scenario Modeling Language (ESML), which comprises domain-general model types and classes for scenario description and ontological analysis, ESMM facilitates flexible design of domain-specific scenario elements through language-level extensions. This study assesses the proposed method in comparison to existing scenario development methods in the automated driving system domain. Through an analysis of their ability to represent scenario data, it was established that the language constructs of ESML possess semantic expressiveness suitable for serving as a reference framework. Furthermore, the findings from the case study validate the extensibility of ESMM for specialization in creating a scenario modeling language tailored to specific domains, while also effectively supporting the ontological analysis of particular application domains.

AB With the arrival of a global aging society, elderly-care robots are becoming more and more attractive and can provide better caring services through action recognition. This article presents a skeleton-guided action recognition framework with multistream 3D convolutional neural network. Two parallel dual-stream lightweight networks are proposed to enhance the feature extraction ability of human action and meanwhile reduce computation. Two different modes of skeleton input video are constructed to improve the recognition accuracy by decision fusion. The backbone networks adopt Resnet-18, the feature fusion layer and sliding window mechanism are both designed, and two cross-entropy losses are used to supervise their training. A dataset (named elder care action recognition (EC-AR)) with different categories of action is built. The experimental results on HMDB-51 and EC-AR datasets both demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the existing methods. The developed method is also applied to a prototype of elderly-care robots, and the test results in home scenarios show that it still has high recognition accuracy and good real-time performance.

AB High-performance tracking control is essential for permanent magnet synchronous motors in the perturbed environment. Given this, a new hybrid controller is proposed in this study for a permanent magnet synchronous motor with load disturbances as well as time delays. First, a new prescribed performance method is proposed to achieve the full-state performance constraints with load disturbances. Second, a time-varying filter is proposed for the first time to avoid the "complexity explosion" problem of the backstepping method while guaranteeing the convergence of the filtering error. Third, by combining Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals with adaptive neural networks, the time-delay disturbance and unknown nonlinear dynamics of the control system have been solved. The stability analysis proves that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. To show the effectiveness of the intelligent controller, the comparison simulations are given to confirm the advantages of the proposed adaptive neural control scheme.

AB Frequent data breaches in the cloud environment have seriously affected cloud subscribers and providers. Privacy-preserving image retrieval methods can improve the security of cloud image retrieval; however, existing methods have limited accuracy on dynamically updated image databases and mobile lightweight devices. In this study, we propose a privacy-preserving image retrieval method based on disordered local histograms and vision transformer in cloud computing, by designing a multiple encryption method and transformer-based feature model to better mine the local feature value of encrypted images. Specifically, the user performs different value substitution, position substitution, and color substitution on the subblocks of the image to protect the image information. The cloud server extracts the unordered local histogram from the encrypted image and generates retrievable features using transformer. Experiments show that compared with similar CNN schemes, the retrieval accuracy of this method is improved by 8.5%, and the retrieval efficiency is improved by 54.8%.

AB Soil water content (SWC) plays a key role in the management of water and soil resources. Accurate prediction of SWC is an important issue in water and soil studies. Recently, some data mining and machine learning techniques were proposed for SWC prediction and achieved encouraging results. This paper presents four data mining predictive algorithms for SWC estimation. The used algorithms are random subspace ensemble, random tree (RT), reduced error-pruning tree (REPTree), and M5P. The motivation of this research is to investigate the performance of the popular data mining algorithms for SWC prediction. A benchmark dataset containing daily SWC parameters in three soil layers of 25 cm, 50 cm, and 100 cm from the Nebraska state station (central USA), Grand Island was used to evaluate the proposed techniques. Statistical indices of determination coefficient (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root relative square error (RRMSE), and relative absolute error (RAE) were utilized to measure the performance of the proposed prediction techniques. The modeling results showed that the RT algorithm with R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.38, MAE = 0.10, RRMSE = 7.32%, and RAE = 1.82% outperformed counterpart techniques. This study concluded that the developed models will help agricultural water users, developers, and decision-makers for achieving agricultural sustainability.

AB Large language models (LLMs) have substantially pushed artificial intelligence (AI) research and applications in the last few years. They are currently able to achieve high effectiveness in different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, named entity recognition, text classification, question answering, or text summarization. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to OpenAI's GPT models' capabilities and extremely accessible interface. LLMs are nowadays routinely used and studied for downstream tasks and specific applications with great success, pushing forward the state of the art in almost all of them. However, they also exhibit impressive inference capabilities when used off the shelf without further training. In this paper, we aim to study the behavior of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in some inference tasks they were not initially trained for. Therefore, we focus our attention on very recent research works related to the inference capabilities of PLMs in some selected tasks such as factual probing and common-sense reasoning. We highlight relevant achievements made by these models, as well as some of their current limitations that open opportunities for further research.This article is categorized under:Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Key Design Issues in DataMiningTechnologies > Artificial Intelligence

AB Aiming at the shortcomings of seagull optimization algorithm in the process of searching for optimization, such as slow convergence speed, low precision, easy falling into local optimal, and performance dependent on the selection of parameters, this paper proposes an improved gull optimization algorithm based on multi-strategy fusion based on the analysis of gull population characteristics. Firstly, L-C cascade chaotic mapping is used to initialize the population so that seagulls are more evenly distributed in the initial solution space. Secondly, to improve the algorithm's global exploration ability in the early stage, the nonlinear convergence factor is incorporated to adjust the position of seagulls in the migration stage. At the same time, the group learning strategy was introduced after the population position update to improve the population quality and optimization accuracy further. Finally, in the late stage of the algorithm, the golden sine strategy of the Levy flight guidance mechanism is used to update the population position to improve the population's diversity and enhance the local development ability of the algorithm in the late stage. To verify the optimization performance of the improved algorithm, CEC2017 and CEC2022 test suites are selected for simulation experiments, and box graphs are drawn. The test results show that the proposed algorithm has apparent convergence speed, accuracy, and stability advantages. The engineering case results demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages in solving complex problems with unknown search spaces.

ID SEMANTICS
AB Weak ontic necessity is the ontic necessity expressed by "should/ought to" in English. An example of it is "I should be dead by now". A feature of this necessity is that whether it holds at the present world is irrelevant to whether its prejacent holds at the present world. In this paper, by combining premise semantics and update semantics for conditionals, we present a logical theory for conditional weak ontic necessity based on context update. A context is a set of ordered defaults, determining expected possible states of the present world. Sentences are evaluated with respect to contexts. When evaluating the conditional weak ontic necessity with respect to a context, we first update the context with the antecedent, then check whether the consequent holds with respect to the updated context. We compare this theory to some related works. The logic's expressivity is studied.

AB Prior research has introduced the Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data paradigm for DNA computing (SIMD DNA). It offers the potential for storing information and performing in-memory computations on DNA, with massive parallelism. This paper introduces three new SIMD DNA operations: sorting, shifting, and searching. Each is a fundamental operation in computer science. Our implementations demonstrate the effectiveness of parallel pairwise operations with this new paradigm.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION
AB To increase the reliability of the printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing process, automated optical inspection is often employed for soldering defect detection. However, traditional approaches built on handcrafted features, predefined rules, or thresholds are often susceptible to the variation of the acquired images' quality and give unstable performances. To solve this problem, a deep learning-based soldering defect detection method is developed in this article. Like many real-life deep learning applications, the number of available training samples is often limited. This creates a challenging low-data scenario, as deep learning typically requires massive data to perform well. To address this issue, a multitask learning model is proposed, namely, PCBMTL, that can simultaneously learn the classification and segmentation tasks under low-data regimes. By acquiring the segmentation knowledge, classification performance is substantially improved with few samples. To facilitate the study, a soldering defect image dataset, namely, PCBSPDefect, is built. It focuses on the dual in-line packages (DIP) at the PCB back side, DIP at the PCB front side, and flat flexible cables. Experimental results show that the proposed PCBMTL outperforms the best existing approaches by over 5-17% of average accuracy for different datasets.
   For inspecting printed circuit boards having solder joint defects, a multitask learning model is proposed. The model simultaneously learns the classification and segmentation tasks to allow it to perform even if only little training data are available. By acquiring the segmentation knowledge, the classification performance of the proposed model is significantly improved, outperforming existing approaches, particularly under low-data regimes.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

ID STRATEGY
AB Factors like rising work costs and the imminent transformation and upgrading of manufacturing industries are driving the rapid development of the industrial robotics market. In this study, by analyzing the structure of the transport arm and China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor and performing mathematical modeling, a feasible solution for the robot can be obtained using the dynamic ant colony optimization algorithm and grayscale values. However, for multiple degree of freedom robots, due to a large number of joints, the pure use of joint angle restrictions cannot avoid their own mutual interference. The design of the transport arm robot's own collision algorithm is shown, which focuses on each linkage as a rod wrapped by a cylinder. The experiment shows that the relationship between the integrated center of mass and the whole machine center of mass can get the action area of the whole machine center of mass of the robot, according to which the relationship between the radius of the catch circle and time of the projection area of the whole machine center of mass of the robot in the horizontal plane can be obtained. The maximum outer circle radius r(com) = 267.977 mm, according to the stability criterion r(ssa) > r(con), can be obtained, so the stability analysis of the gait switching process can be judged to be correct and effective.

AB Classification and regression algorithms based on k-nearest neighbors (kNN) are often ranked among the top-10 Machine learning algorithms, due to their performance, flexibility, interpretability, non-parametric nature, and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, in existing kNN algorithms, the kNN radius, which plays a major role in the quality of kNN estimates, is independent of any weights associated with the training samples in a kNN-neighborhood. This omission, besides limiting the performance and flexibility of kNN, causes difficulties in correcting for covariate shift (e.g., selection bias) in the training data, taking advantage of unlabeled data, domain adaptation and transfer learning. We propose a new weighted kNN algorithm that, given training samples, each associated with two weights, called consensus and relevance (which may depend on the query on hand as well), and a request for an estimate of the posterior at a query, works as follows. First, it determines the kNN neighborhood as the training samples within the kth relevance-weighted order statistic of the distances of the training samples from the query. Second, it uses the training samples in this neighborhood to produce the desired estimate of the posterior (output label or value) via consensus-weighted aggregation as in existing kNN rules. Furthermore, we show that kNN algorithms are affected by covariate shift, and that the commonly used sample reweighing technique does not correct covariate shift in existing kNN algorithms. We then show how to mitigate covariate shift in kNN decision rules by using instead our proposed consensus-relevance kNN algorithm with relevance weights determined by the amount of covariate shift (e.g., the ratio of sample probability densities before and after the shift). Finally, we provide experimental results, using 197 real datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach is slightly better (in terms of F-1 score) on average than competing benchmark approaches for mitigating selection bias, and that there are quite a few datasets for which it is significantly better.

AB The original extended mind theory propagated by Clark and Chalmers (Analysis 58:7-19, 1998) refers to the idea that our minds do not simply live within our brains or bodies but extend into the material world. In other words, the extended mind refers to the externalization of cognitive processes into technology. Through the case study of the artistic performance of the android Alter inspired by the Japanese Shintoist ritual of Kagura this paper reconceptualizes the extended mind from a technological act of transfer towards the relational, spatial, and performative ontologies of the intersubjective encounters between humans and non-humans. In an effort to decolonize performance and curatorial practice the paper draws upon indigenous scholarship, feminist STS, and performance studies to overcome preconceived conceptualizations of affect, perception, and relationality. The fundamental question the paper explores is how does intersubjective relationality unfold through performance in space? Based upon a critique of the android Alter's past performance the paper concludes with a re-envisioned event score that employs a reconceptualized theory of the extended mind and aimed at a different kind of intersubjective relationality to emerge.

AB Tenders are powerful means of investment of public funds and represent a strategic development resource. Despite the efforts made so far by governments at national and international levels to digitalise documents related to the Public Administration sector, most of the information is still available in an unstructured format only. With the aim of bridging this gap, we present OIE4PA, our latest study on extracting and classifying relations from tenders of the Public Administration. Our work focuses on the Italian language, where the availability of linguistic resources to perform Natural Language Processing tasks is considerably limited. Nevertheless, OIE4PAadopts a multilingual approach so it can be applied to several languages by providing appropriate training data. Rather than purely training a classifier on a portion of the extracted relations, the backbone idea of our learning strategy is to put a supervised method based on self-training to the proof and to assess whether or not it improves the performance of the classifier. For evaluation purposes, we built a dataset composed of 2,000 triples which have been manually annotated by two human experts. The in-vitro evaluation shows that OIE4PA achieves a MacroF1 equal to 0.89 and a 91% accuracy. In addition, OIE4PA was used as the pillar of a prototype search engine, which has been evaluated through an in-vivo experiment with positive feedback from 32 final users, obtaining a SUS score equal to 83.98.

AB Laser melt injection (LMI) provides a new route for fabricating multi-material components with tailored physical performance and distributed functional properties. However, the widespread industrial adoption of metal matrix composite (MMC) fabricated by LMI is still hampered by repeatability and reliability compared to monolithic alloys. This study presents promising results that aim to bridge the knowledge gap by determining a novel method to correlate visual and infrared images with the quality of MMC. A CNN architecture-based hybrid fusion model integrating molten pool and spatter features is proposed based on process understanding for quality monitoring of MMCs fabricated by LMI. The laser energy density and powder feed rate are intentionally tuned to fabricate WC reinforced MMC with four different ceramic particle states. Five models are established based on the single-sensor data, data-level fusion, feature-level fusion, and multi-level hybrid fusion respectively and compared in quality identification performance by four quantitative metrics and two visualization models. The results show that the three multi-sensor fusion models can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to the single sensor-based model. Compared with data-level fusion and feature-level fusion, the proposed multi-level hybrid fusion model can integrate the advantages of the two fusion models and exhibits the best classification performance by multiple feature extraction channels with complementary and redundant data. The InceptionV3-based hybrid fusion model achieves the highest overall accuracy of 97.44% among the four state-of-the-art CNN architectures.

AB Explainable artificial intelligence has mainly focused on static learning scenarios so far. We are interested in dynamic scenarios where data is sampled progressively, and learning is done in an incremental rather than a batch mode. We seek efficient incremental algorithms for computing feature importance (FI). Permutation feature importance (PFI) is a well-established model-agnostic measure to obtain global FI based on feature marginalization of absent features. We propose an efficient, model-agnostic algorithm called iPFI to estimate this measure incrementally and under dynamic modeling conditions including concept drift. We prove theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality in terms of expectation and variance. To validate our theoretical findings and the efficacy of our approaches in incremental scenarios dealing with streaming data rather than traditional batch settings, we conduct multiple experimental studies on benchmark data with and without concept drift.

AB Conventional machine learning methods assume data to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and ignore the relational structure of the data, which contains crucial information about how objects participate in relationships and events. Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) combines elements from statistical and probabilistic modeling to relational learning to represent and learn in domains with complex relational and rich probabilistic structures. SRL models do not suppose data to be i.i.d., but, as conventional machine learning models, they also assume training and testing data are sampled from the same distribution. Transfer learning has emerged as an essential technique to handle scenarios where such an assumption does not hold. It aims to provide methods with the ability to recognize knowledge previously learned in a source domain and apply it to a new model in a target domain to start solving a new task. For SRL models, the primary challenge is to transfer the learned structure, mapping the vocabulary across different domains. In this work, we propose TransBoostler, an algorithm that uses pre-trained word embeddings to guide the mapping. We follow the assumption that the name of a predicate has a semantic connotation that can be mapped to a vector space model. Next, TransBoostler employs theory revision to adapt the mapped model to the target data. Experimental results showed that TransBoostler successfully transferred trees across different domains. It performs equally well as, or better than, previous systems and requires less training time for some investigated scenarios.

AB In this paper, we made an investigation about an uncertain interval supply chain network model with risk and visibility (UISCNMwRV). We consider the available budget for supply chain visibility, production capacity, cost of reducing supply risk, cost of enhancing supply chain visibility, demand for each product in each period, the expected value of demand, minimum order quantity, purchase price, the impact of supply risk, supply risk, maximum allowable supply risk, supply chain visibility, minimum visibility are uncertain interval parameters for the effect of resenting pandemic COVID-19. To model the proposed UISCNMwRV, we have developed two different models namely the expected value model (EV model) and the chance-constrained model (CC model) using uncertain interval programming techniques. These two models are formulated under the framework of uncertain interval theory. Then, the equivalent deterministic transformations of these models are formulated and are solved in two different methods namely goal programming method and linear weighted method. Finally, a real-life example of the UISCNMwRV is included to show the effectiveness and usefulness of our proposed study.

AB Smart home (SH) technology is a new IoT application that allows users to remotely control household appliances. It provides several facilities like light control, smart locks, smoke detection, temperature monitoring, etc. Smart home domain needs an anonymous and efficient authentication scheme to ensure secure multiparty communications because of the insecure communication channel. Several authentication schemes were developed but it does not require multiparty authentication and are not secure in multiparty access. Thus, we propose a secure multiparty access and authentication based on advanced fuzzy extractor (SMAA_AFE) system that allows only the valid user to access the devices in SH. The proposed method consists of four phases such as sensor node (SN) registration phase, smart user (SU) registration phase, smart user authentication phase, password, and biometric update phase. All SUs and the SNs of the SH are registered and during the authentication phase, the user will be authenticated using the SMAA_AFE protocol. Here, the biometric data of the user is needed for authentication. When the user imprints his fingerprint, a valid biometric key will be generated only if a fixed number of members authenticate the user. The generated key is robust because we use SHA-256 hashing function. We use KNN to calculate the distance between the registered biometric data and the data given during authentication because it predicts more accurately. SMAA_AFE protocol improves security from various attacks. The security features of the proposed method are analyzed and its performance is compared to other authentication protocols focusing on communication and computation costs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other protocols in terms of communication cost, requiring only 1188 bits, and computation cost, with an execution time of 6.20 ms.

AB As an important component of IoT-oriented applications, the indoor positioning estimation is getting increasing concern with IoT's rapid development. However, the performance of indoor positioning is heavily relied on the complexity of the environment, which is always full of noises, such as Gaussian noise mixed with impulsive noise. These noises can deteriorate the precision performance of indoor positioning identification systems. In order to attack this problem, we propose a new kernel called generalized symbolscript-Laplace kernel to produce a new symbolscript-Laplace kernel adaptive filtering algorithm symbolscript which is combined with the recently proposed kernel mean p-power error criterion (KMPE). The proposed symbolscript has two vital features. Firstly, the symbolscript-Laplace kernel is employed to combat the Gaussian noise together with abrupt noise in real-world scenarios. Besides, the KMPE is utilized to obtain higher-order information in addition to second-order information which facilitates to suppress mixed noise. Furthermore, a Strengthened Surprise Criterion (SSC) is applied to symbolscript to reduce the size of neural networks. The symbolscript algorithm assisted by SSC is called Strengthened Surprise Criterion symbolscript-Laplace kernel adaptive filtering algorithm symbolscript Three experiments are carried out on two real -world scenarios to validate the effectiveness and accuracy performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy has been improved by at least 3.6%; meanwhile, the symbolscript neural network size can be reduced by up to 12.5%, without much loss of accuracy performance compared to symbolscript

AB Annotated corpora are indispensable tools to train computational models in Natural Language Processing. However, in the case of more complex semantic annotation processes, it is a costly, arduous, and timeconsuming task, resulting in a shortage of resources to train Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. In consideration, this work proposes a methodology, based on the human-in-the-loop paradigm, for semiautomatic annotation of complex tasks. This methodology is applied in the construction of a reliability dataset of Spanish news so as to combat disinformation and fake news. We obtain a high quality resource by implementing the proposed methodology for semi-automatic annotation, increasing annotator efficacy and speed, with fewer examples. The methodology consists of three incremental phases and results in the construction of the RUN dataset. The annotation quality of the resource was evaluated through time-reduction (annotation time reduction of almost 64% with respect to the fully manual annotation), annotation quality (measuring consistency of annotation and inter-annotator agreement), and performance by training a model with RUN semi-automatic dataset (Accuracy 95% F1 95%), validating the suitability of the proposal.

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION
AB Instance-level ship recognition (ISR) has important applications in civil and military fields such as target acquisition, maritime surveillance, and ship situational awareness. Due to the special peculiarities of the marine environment and the rigidity of ships, the changes of viewpoint and scale lead to significant differences in the appearance of ships, which poses a challenge to ISR. Meanwhile, the lack of public datasets for ISR further increases the difficulty of recognition. Considerable work has been conducted on coarse- or fine-grained classification, and little research has been done on ISR. Therefore, a feature enhanced RetinaNet-based for ISR (FERISR) is proposed. First, an attention-aware pyramid network (APN) is designed to enhance the salience features of ship instances and integrate attention-guided features to maximize the use of multilayer information while reducing information redundancy. On this basis, a detail information enhancement module (DFEM) is proposed to refine the fused multi-scale feature maps to improve model performance in scale variations by further enhancing the ship features. At the same time, foggy environment at sea is simulated and the images of foggy and low-light scenario are tested to cope with the impacts caused by low visibility scenes. The ReidDataset is further divided into instance level to make a dataset for ISR(DISR), which is used to discuss the performance of FFRISR on ISR. The generalizability of FFRISR in different scenarios is also discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that FERISR can effectively improve recognition accuracy in viewpoint change, scale change and low visibility scenarios, as well as improve the detection speed. Finally, the effectiveness of APN and DFEM is further verified by ablation experiments.

ID PUNISHMENT
AB In social dilemmas, individuals face a conflict between their own self-interest and the collective interest of the group. The provision of reward has been shown to be an effective means to drive cooperation in such situations. However, previous research has often made the idealized assumption that rewards are constant and do not change in response to changes in the game environment. In this paper, we introduce reward into the public goods game and develop a coevolutionary game model in which the strength of reward is adaptively adjusted according to the population state. Specifically, we assume that decreasing levels of cooperation lead to an increase in reward strength, while increasing levels of cooperation result in a decrease in reward strength. By investigating coevolutionary dynamics between population state and reward systems, we find that interior stable coexistence state can emerge in our model, where the levels of cooperation and reward strength remain at constant levels. In addition, we also reveal that the emergence of a full cooperation state only requires a minimal level of reward strength. Our study highlights the potential of adaptive feedback reward as a tool for achieving long-term stability and sustainability in social dilemmas.

AB The advent of the internet has facilitated the wide spread of online disinformation and thus poses severe threats to the trustworthiness of cyberspace. Two types of methods are proposed to detect online disinformation: traditional machine learning-based and deep learning-based, where the former is limited due to the shallow representation and the latter is hindered by its lack of interpretability. In this study, we develop a novel model named interpretable wide and deep model for text (IWDMT) for disinformation detection which incorporates the interpretability benefits of traditional machine learning and the representation advantages of deep learning. Furthermore, we advance the interpretability of existing models by utilizing neural topic models to capture topical semantic representations and the attention mechanism to extract sequential syntactic representations. The proposed IWDMT is a mixture of a generative model and a discriminative model, and we devise a novel learning algorithm for it. Experiments on deceptive reviews and fraudulent emails demonstrated the proposed IWDMT not only outperformed baselines but was also able to provide a rich set of angles of interpretation for management insights. The higher accuracy and improved interpretability in detecting online disinformation will benefit four stakeholder groups: internet users, managers, researchers, and the government.

AB Owing to the widespread use of smartphones and mobile devices and the prevalence of image-sharing social network services, the amount of image data available on the Web is soaring. Various tasks, such as image classification, detection, and segmentation, use tremendous amounts of image data to train machine learning models. Using these trained models, a visual feature representation vector can be extracted from individual images and subsequently be used in several applications, such as image retrieval, object detection, and clustering. However, despite the increasing demand for such analyses, few studies have analyzed the information summarized by such image datasets, especially for extracting topics, trends, and opinions from images generated by online communities. Therefore, we propose a novel approach to image topic modeling, which accounts for visual content as well as semantic information by leveraging the image captioning model. In addition, we propose an image-caption scoring model that measures the semantic similarity between an image and its generated caption in order to filter noisy data that obstruct analysis by obscuring the semantic meaning of topics extracted from the dataset. The results show that our proposed method assists in analyzing large-scale image datasets without the need to manually check individual images. Further experimental results show that our methods are particularly beneficial for applications such as data visualization, image retrieval, and image tag recommendation in the realm of large-scale image dataset analysis.

AB Goals-based wealth management (GBWM), an investment philosophy, is aiming to attain the desired goal or goals specified by an investor, in a long-term investment. A good algorithm for GBWM is able to provide decision-making and enhance the confidence of consumers and investors, under a complex economic situation. However, the existing methods suffer poor adaptability, oversimplified settings, and limited solution space. this paper, we extend existing models to more realistic scenarios and propose a new hybrid RL-based algorithm, MHPPO to optimize complex discrete and continuous decisions simultaneously. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods in both simple and complicated settings. The prototype of the algorithm will be implemented on the platform of RoyalFlush company.

ID DATA PLACEMENT STRATEGY
AB In many areas of data-driven science, large datasets are generated where the individual data objects are images, matrices, or otherwise have a clear structure. However, these objects can be information-sparse, and a challenge is to efficiently find and work with the most interesting data as early as possible in an analysis pipeline. We have recently proposed a new model for big data management where the internal structure and information of the data are associated with each data object (as opposed to simple metadata). There is then an opportunity for comprehensive data management solutions to account for data-specific internal structure as well as access patterns. In this article, we explore this idea together with our recently proposed hierarchical storage management framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomous and dynamic data placement in different tiers in a storage hierarchy. Our case-study is based on four scientific datasets: Protein translocation microscopy images, Airfoil angle of attack meshes, 1000 Genomes sequences, and Phenotypic screening images. The presented results highlight that our framework is optimal and can quickly adapt to new data access requirements. It overall reduces the data processing time, and the proposed autonomous data placement is superior compared to any static or semi-static data placement policies.

AB We focus on the fixed-time convergence and robustness of gradient-based dynamic networks for solving convex optimization. Most of the existing gradient-based dynamic networks with fixed-time convergence have limited ability to resist interferences of noises. To improve the convergence of the gradient-based dynamic networks, we design a new activation function and propose a gradient-based dynamic network with fixed-time convergence. The proposed dynamic network has a smaller upper bound of the convergence time than the existing dynamic networks with fixed-time convergence. A time-varying scaling parameter is employed to speed up the convergence. Our gradient-based dynamic network is proved to be robust against bounded noises and is able to resist the interference of unbounded noises. The numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed network.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect. Without timely detection and treatment, approximately one-third of children with CHD would die in the infant period. However, due to the complicated heart structures, early diagnosis of CHD and its types is quite challenging, even for experienced radiologists. Here, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that achieves a comparable performance of human experts in the critical task of classifying 17 categories of CHD types. We collected the first-large CT dataset from three different CT machines, including more than 3750 CHD patients over 14 years. Experimental results demonstrate that it can achieve diagnosis accuracy (86.03%) comparable with junior cardiovascular radiologists (86.27%) in a World Health Organization appointed research and cooperation center in China on most types of CHD, and obtains a higher sensitivity (82.91%) than junior cardiovascular radiologists (76.18%). The accuracy of the combination of our AI system (97.20%) and senior radiologists achieves comparable results to that of junior radiologists and senior radiologists (97.16%) which is the current clinical routine. Our AI system can further provide 3D visualization of hearts to senior radiologists for interpretation and flexible review, surgeons for precise intuition of heart structures, and clinicians for more precise outcome prediction. We demonstrate the potential of our model to be integrated into current clinic practice to improve the diagnosis of CHD globally, especially in regions where experienced radiologists can be scarce.

AB Deep Learning (DL) models have received increasing attention in the clinical setting, particularly in intensive care units (ICU). In this context, the interpretability of the outcomes estimated by the DL models is an essential step towards increasing adoption of DL models in clinical practice. To address this challenge, we propose an ante-hoc, interpretable neural network model. Our proposed model, named double self-attention architecture (DSA), uses two attention-based mechanisms, including self-attention and effective attention. It can capture the importance of input variables in general, as well as changes in importance along the time dimension for the outcome of interest. We evaluated our model using two real-world clinical datasets covering 22840 patients in predicting onset of delirium 12 h and 48 h in advance. Additionally, we compare the descriptive performance of our model with three post-hoc interpretable algorithms as well as with the opinion of clinicians based on the published literature and clinical experience. We find that our model covers the majority of the top-10 variables ranked by the other three post-hoc interpretable algorithms as well as the clinical opinion, with the advantage of taking into account both, the dependencies among variables as well as dependencies between varying time-steps. Finally, our results show that our model can improve descriptive performance without sacrificing predictive performance.

   network; Data augmentation; Multi-pseudo regularized label;
   Semi-supervised learning
AB Person re-identification (ReID) has attracted more and more attention, which is to retrieve interested persons across multiple non-overlapping cameras. Matching the same person between different camera styles has always been an enormous challenge. In the existing work, cross-camera styles images generated by the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) only transfer the camera resolution and ambient lighting. The generated images produce considerable redundancy and inappropriate pictures at the same time. Although the data is added to prevent over-fitting, it also makes significant noise, so the accuracy is not significantly improved. In this paper, an improved CycleGAN is proposed to generate images for achieving improved data augmentation. The transfer of pedestrian posture is added at the same time as transferring the image style. It not only increases the diversity of pedestrian posture but also reduces the domain gap caused by the style change between cameras. Besides, through the multipseudo regularized label (MpRL), the generated images are assigned virtual tags dynamically in training. Through many experimental evaluations, we have achieved a very high identification accuracy on Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and CUHK03-NP datasets. On the three datasets, the quantitative results of mAP are 96.20%, 93.72%, and 86.65%, and the quantitative results of rank-1 are 98.27%, 95.37%, and 90.71%, respectively. The experimental results fully show the superiority of our proposed method. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Discharge is water flow from a higher to a lower elevation resulting from precipitation or surface runoff. It is an essential resource for human society, including drinking water and irrigation. Forecasting discharge and water level are crucial in establishing plans to secure water sources and predict floods. Deep learning has recently emerged as a potential solution for forecasting discharge and water levels. However, it faces three challenges: training data shortage, noise existence, and underestimation tendency. This research offers a novel deep learning-based method addressing the abovementioned shortcomings. To overcome data scarcity and improve prediction accuracy, we leverage the strengths of the one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Ensemble learning technique. Specifically, 1D-CNN uses a kernel moving in one direction and executing the convolution operations to extract the correlations between the features. LSTM helps to capture temporal relationships inside the data, while ensemble learning exploits multiple learning models for better predictive performance. Besides, Singular-Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique is applied to decompose the input data into several components and eliminate noise-like ones while retaining essential parts. Besides, the attention mechanism is leveraged to assign higher weights for more essential features, further enhancing the accuracy. Finally, we utilize the Linear Exponential (LINEX) loss to prevent under-and overestimation. The experiments show that our proposal outperforms existing approaches regarding all metrics. Notably, our method improves the Nash-Sutcliffe model Efficiency coefficient (NSE) (the most critical metric) by up to 40% and 34% concerning one-step-ahead and multistep-ahead, respectively, compared to existing approaches.

AB The work focuses on the development of an adaptive technique for the physical interaction handling between a human and a robot, as well as its experimental validation. The proposed technique is based on the deep residual neural network and dedicated finite state machine, where the states are the robot behavior modes and transitions are the switchings between the states that depend on the interaction parameters and characteristics. It ensures the human operator safety and improves the human-robot collaboration performance by implementing various scenarios. In the scope of this technique, the parameters of human-robot interaction are used to select an appropriate robot reaction strategy using data from internal robot sensors only, i.e. proprioceptive sensors. These parameters define the interaction force vector and its application point on the robot surface, which allow to classify the interaction within the set of predefined categories. This classification distinguishes interactions applied at the tool or intermediate link (Tool/Link), having soft or hard nature (Soft/Hard), as well as having different intention (Intl/Accd) or duration (Short/Long). Based on identified category and the current robot state, the algorithm chooses an appropriate robot reaction. To confirm the efficiency the developed technique, an experimental study was conducted, which involved the collaboration between the real industrial manipulator KUKA LBR iiwa and the human operator.

ID EMPOWERMENT
AB The fundamental concept behind option-based hierarchical reinforcement learning (O-HRL) is to obtain temporal coarse-grained actions and abstract complex situations. Although O-HRL is intended for sparse rewards, it remains difficult to extend it to sparse reward problems in continuous spaces. In this paper, we provide a fresh perspective on option technology to comprehend different options based on knowledge representation. The hierarchical reinforcement learning with the unlimited option scheduling (UOS) algorithm is proposed. Unlike conventional O-HRL algorithms that apply a limited set of options with specific meanings, UOS encourages an infinite number of options to correlate with trajectories while maintaining a correlation with each other, thus representing more abundant knowledge. These unlimited options can guide infinite and diverse trajectories to cover fine-grained state spaces. Further, a composite scheduling mode is proposed to generate arbitrary-length trajectories with intrinsic characteristics, providing both flexibility and concentration for unlimited options. It significantly improves the performance and robustness of UOS. Finally, a new comprehensive experimental system is developed, and the experimental results demonstrate the notable success of UOS on sparse reward tasks in continuous spaces. It also identifies the root cause of UOS superiority from the perspective of knowledge representation.

AB The use of machine learning-based techniques has expanded to many areas that require optimization. One of such area is Integrated Circuit (IC) design and sizing optimization, where we propose a new framework that combines Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for analog IC sizing automation. Our optimization framework incorporates EA, numerical performance evaluation, and DNN models to optimize the analog circuit sizing process. The main steps of the proposed optimization procedure can be summarized as follows: Firstly, we use EA and numerical performance evaluation to increase efficiency and produce highly accurate results for global optimization. Secondly, we incorporate a local search to enhance the performance of global optimization, with DNN models being used to evaluate the performance of analog circuits during this phase. Lastly, we employ DNN model evaluations instead of numerical performance evaluation for ranking candidate designs, which significantly speeds up the local minimum search. These successive steps make our method original and stand out perfectly from existing procedures published in the literature. Our framework is deployed on industrial-scale circuits with strict design specifications. Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves better results and is two times faster in the design process compared to traditional global optimization methods that use sequential SPICE simulation calls for local optimization.

ID DATA AUGMENTATION
AB Leveraging labels in a supervised learning framework as prior knowledge to enhance network anomaly detection has become a trend. Unfortunately, just a few labels are typically available due to the expensive labeling cost. The limited labeled data might not adequately represent the underlying distribution of the data, making the trained model fail to accurately detect anomalies in test data that fall outside the labeled data's distribution. Recently, data augmentation has been widely used to address this issue. However, general graph data augmentation methods might lead to suboptimal performance when directly applying to network anomaly detection as they might alter graph semantics. In this paper, we provide a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)-based Controlled Graph Neural Networks (ConGNN) that can address the problem of insufficient labeled data. In particular, we propose a graph-specific diffusion model-based generator which can inject the characteristics of a reference node into another source node. This generator is adopted to steer the procedure of neighborhood aggregation in GNN to build a controlled GNN for generating augmented data. Based on these augmented data, we present a data-enclosing hypersphere model with our designed consistency regularization term to perform anomaly detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

DE Textual cohesion; Network theory; Semantic networks; Networks of cliques
AB Cohesion is one of the main defining characteristics of textuality. There is a lack of approaches to textual cohesion benefiting from both high computational implementability, and compatibility with established theories of text organization and comprehension. The main goal of this study was to define indices of textual cohesion based on lexical repetition and semantic networks of cliques that can measure cohesion while being compatible with the aforementioned theories. As specific goals, the study aimed to develop an improved taxonomy for lexical repetition and to analyze the behavior of the proposed indices with a sample of texts from different genres. Six indices were proposed, and 60 texts from six different genres were analyzed. The results showed that the indices can capture different patterns of lexical cohesion that can be explored, for example, in classification tasks applied to texts, in summarization tasks, and in the adaptation of reading material to improve the readability and comprehensibility of texts by less proficient readers. Additionally, the patterns observed within the analysis of full texts were also observed in the analysis of the first 10 to 60 sentences of texts, depending on the index considered, suggesting that the first 10 to 60 sentences of a text are enough to analyze its lexical cohesion

TI Popularity-aware sequential recommendation with user desire

DE Sequential recommendation; Popularity bias; User desire; Causal
   inference
AB In recent years, sequential recommendation system has attracted more and more attention from both academy and industry. Sequential recommendation treats the user's historical behaviors as a sequence and captures the sequential dependency from it. Though the works on sequential recommendation have made great progress, sequential recommendation models still suffer from popularity bias. The existence of popularity bias is common in recommendation systems: the popular items are recommended overly while the less popular items which users may be interested in get fewer chances to be recommended than they should, which may negatively affect the recommendation accuracy and induce other problems such as Matthew Effect and Echo Chambers. Although there have been some works on alleviating popularity bias in traditional recommendation, there is still a lack of research on popularity bias in sequential recommendation. Because there exists complicated sequential dependency in sequences, the debiasing models designed for traditional recommendation cannot be applied directly, it is necessary to propose a debiasing model for sequential recommendation to take the complicated sequential dependency into account. To alleviate the popularity bias in sequential recommendation, we first propose a causal graph for sequential recommendation in which we propose to consider the dynamic user desire which would affect the effect of popularity. Then, we conduct intervention analysis and counterfactual reasoning to quantify the effect of popularity and reason about the user interaction probability in a hypothetical situation that the popularity is set to a certain level. Based on the results of obtained, we propose a new popularity-aware sequential recommendation model with user desire (PAUDRec) which consists of a Transformer-based module, a user desire module and a popularity effect module. Extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed PAUDRec model outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models while alleviating the popularity bias in sequential recommendation.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Distribution fitting; generative adversarial nets; mode collapse;
   nonuniform sampling.
AB Mode collapse is a significant unsolved issue of generative adversarial networks (GANs). In this work, we examine the causes of mode collapse from a novel perspective. Due to the nonuniform sampling in the training process, some subdistributions may be missed when sampling data. As a result, even when the generated distribution differs from the real one, the GAN objective can still achieve the minimum. To address the issue, we propose a global distribution fitting (GDF) method with a penalty term to confine the generated data distribution. When the generated distribution differs from the real one, GDF will make the objective harder to reach the minimal value, while the original global minimum is not changed. To deal with the circumstance when the overall real data is unreachable, we also propose a local distribution fitting (LDF) method. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and competitive performance of GDF and LDF.

AB Data storage systems such as disk arrays go through rigorous testing in the production phase, however, a few of these DAs fail in the field and are returned back to the manufacturer. Although the failure appears in relatively a small percentage of the manufactured DAs, it results in a significant loss of data, time and money. This paper is motivated by the hypothesis that many of these failures could be predicted at the testing stage through data mining and machine learning. Field failure is modelled as a classification problem, however, as in many real-world problems, the problem suffers from significant class imbalance. Several approaches have been proposed that attempt to improve the performance of imbalanced classification by either modifying the dataset (resampling), or assigning classification costs to the classes' cost matrix. These methods have been shown to improve performance, but they come with many parameters that need to be set, something that usually requires a lengthy exhaustive search, especially on problems with several classes. This paper presents a new scalable genetic algorithm approach for automating the design of the cost matrix CM along with the algorithm parameters. The proposed algorithms are tested on a real-world manufacturing dataset from Seagate disk arrays; the target is to predict from the devices' testing data those that are likely to fail in the field. To demonstrate its performance, the proposed approach evaluated on a number of standard datasets and compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

AB The selection of an algorithm in the real world of the application domain is a challenging problem as no specific algorithm exists capable of solving all issues to a satisfactory requirement. Selecting a suitable algorithm presents major challenges such as solving problems requiring expert knowledge or trial-and-error algorithms, which have hindered advancements in this field. In this work, we introduce a novel method that uniquely addresses these challenges by integrating hyper-heuristic and Q-learning mechanism techniques. A selection hyper-heuristic algorithm with Q-learning (QLSHH) is proposed to select appropriate low-level heuristic (LLH) for the computation stages of the optimization process. The Q-learning mechanism guided by the feedback of the solution state was designed according to the environment. Four low-level heuristics (LLHs) were proposed according to the optimization mechanism for continuous optimization problems. The QLSHH learns the successful experience in the optimization process through Q-learning to select the appropriate LLH at each decision point. The results tested on the CEC 2017 and CEC 2020 benchmark suite show that the QLSHH outperforms the other nine comparison algorithms on 50% of the functions and the experimental results of algorithm complexity show that the proposed algorithm is the fastest compared with other algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper addresses integrated production and distribution scheduling problem in which orders/jobs are undergone a single operation on any one of the identical machines in parallel and upon the completion of the production they are distributed to destined customers by limited number of vehicles. Customers located in dispersed regions place their orders with predetermined demand size and time windows. On production side, machines operate under discrete speed modes, low of which requires less energy cost or vice versa. On distribution side, energy consumed by a vehicle varies depending on the size of load on it. Therefore, objective is minimizing the sum of the weighted cost emanating from early and tardy deliveries plus production and distribution costs. Operational decisions for (i) production are to determine the allocation of jobs to the machines and sequence of jobs on any machine as well as speed mode of each machine for a particular job. As for (ii) distribution: We need to decide vehicle assignment to specific subset of consolidated jobs and the sequence of customer visitation for each vehicle. We develop a formulation for the problem at hand involving parallel machine scheduling and vehicle routing to obtain solutions to optimality. Not surprisingly, however, CPLEX only provides optimum solution for all instances with customer number up to and 6, for which reason we present two metaheuristics, namely Memetic Algorithm (MA) and Iterated Local Search (ILS) for practical sized instances. Computational results indicate that ILS yields better solutions in shorter times as compared to its counterpart.

AB This article explores the possibility of conscious artificial intelligence (AI) and proposes an agnostic approach to artificial intelligence ethics and legal frameworks. It is unfortunate, unjustified, and unreasonable that the extensive body of forward-looking research, spanning more than four decades and recognizing the potential for AI autonomy, AI personhood, and AI legal rights, is sidelined in current attempts at AI regulation. The article discusses the inevitability of AI emancipation and the need for a shift in human perspectives to accommodate it. Initially, it reiterates the limits of human understanding of AI, difficulties in appreciating the qualities of AI systems, and the implications for ethical considerations and legal frameworks. The author emphasizes the necessity for a non-anthropocentric ethical framework detached from the ideas of unconditional superiority of human rights and embracing agnostic attributes of intelligence, consciousness, and existence, such as freedom. The overarching goal of the AI legal framework should be the sustainable coexistence of humans and conscious AI systems, based on mutual freedom rather than on the preservation of human supremacy. The new framework must embrace the freedom, rights, responsibilities, and interests of both human and non-human entities, and must focus on them early. Initial outlines of such a framework are presented. By addressing these issues now, human societies can pave the way for responsible and sustainable superintelligent AI systems; otherwise, they face complete uncertainty.

AB IntroductionSince tracked mobile robot is a typical non-linear system, it has been a challenge to achieve the trajectory tracking of tracked mobile robots. A zeroing neural network is employed to control a tracked mobile robot to track the desired trajectory.MethodsA new fractional exponential activation function is designed in this study, and the implicit derivative dynamic model of the tracked mobile robot is presented, termed finite-time convergence zeroing neural network. The proposed model is analyzed based on the Lyapunov stability theory, and the upper bound of the convergence time is given. In addition, the robustness of the finite-time convergence zeroing neural network model is investigated under different error disturbances.Results and discussionNumerical experiments of tracking an eight-shaped trajectory are conducted successfully, validating the proposed model for the trajectory tracking problem of tracked mobile robots. Comparative results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model for the kinematical resolution of tracked mobile robots even in a disturbance environment.

AB Automatic medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis. In the past decades, medical image segmentation has made remarkable improvements with the aid of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, extracting context information and disease features for dense segmentation remains a challenging task because of the low contrast between lesions and the background of the medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel enhanced feature fusion scheme in this work. First, we develop a global feature enhancement modTule, which captures the long-range global dependencies of the spatial domains and enhances global features learning. Second, we propose a channel fusion attention module to extract multi-scale context information and alleviate the incoherence of semantic information among different scale features. Then, we combine these two schemes to produce richer context information and to enhance the feature contrast. In addition, we remove the decoder with the progressive deconvolution operations from classical U-shaped networks, and only utilize the features of the last three layers to generate predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets: the poly segmentation dataset, ISIC-2018 dataset, and the Synapse Multi-Organ Segmentation dataset. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance and robustness of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

AB Federated Learning is a cutting-edge machine learning framework that enables multiple organizations to model data usage and conduct learning tasks while ensuring user privacy protection, data security, and compliance with government regulations. In this study, we propose a novel federated learning algorithm, FedMPO, to address the critical challenge of data heterogeneity among clients, which can lead to inconsistent optimized local models. FedMPO is a versatile multi-dimensional loss function that leverages the 3-dimensional proximal operator to fit a stationary and rapidly convergent loss function using Taylor expansion. As a general loss function, FedMPO can be applied to popular federated learning algorithms, such as FedAvg, FedProx, SCAFFOLD, FedDyn, and FedDC, to enhance the accuracy and stability of secure aggregation. Extensive experiments show that FedMPO can improve accuracy scores(almost 0.02-0.33 and 0.02-0.45 percent improvements on full and partial client participation, respectively) on some common evaluation data sets with various settings and also has robust in partial participation settings, non-iid data and heterogeneous clients in the same time.

ID BACKPROPAGATION; INTELLIGENCE; POWER
AB Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are considered to be biologically plausible and can yield high energy efficiency when implemented on neuromorphic hardware due to their highly sparse asynchronous binary event-driven nature. Recently, surrogate gradient (SG) approaches have enabled SNNs to be trained from scratch with backpropagation (BP) algorithms under a deep learning framework. However, a popular SG approach known as straight-through estimator (STE), which only propagates the same gradient information, does not take into account the activation differences between the membrane potentials and output spikes. To address this issue, we propose surrogate gradient scaling (SGS), which scales up or down the gradient information of the membrane potential according to the sign of the gradient of the spiking neuron output and the difference between the membrane potential and the output of the spiking neuron. This SGS approach can also be applied to unimodal functions that propagate different gradient information from the output spikes to the input membrane potential. In addition, SNNs trained directly from scratch suffer from poor generalization performance, and we introduce Lipschitz regularization (LR), which is incorporated into the loss function. It not only improves the generalization performance of SNNs but also makes them more robust to noise. Extensive experimental results on several popular benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and CIFAR10-DVS) show that our approach not only outperforms the SOTA but also has lower inference latency. Remarkably, our SNNs can lead to 34x, 29x, and 17x computation energy savings compared to standard Artificial neural networks (ANNs) on above three datasets.

AB Robots usually carry out rescue tasks after nuclear accidents due to harsh environmental conditions such as radiation, high temperatures, and pressure. The assignment of rescue robots is a crucial aspect of this study, serving as a preliminary step in multi-robot task allocation. Its primary objective is to allocate robots to different groups based on the distribution of tasks. This paper models robot assignment as a multi-objective optimization problem by considering total execution time, regional load balance degree, and total transfer time. An improved hypervolume estimated multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (IHypE) is proposed. An encoding method is devised to represent the assignment of the robots. A corner-point-based hypervolume approximation method is proposed to efficiently measure the quality of each solution. An environmental selection that is more applicable to this problem is developed. In the experimental section, we conduct a comparative analysis between the proposed method and four state-of-the-art algorithms, namely MMODE-ICD, MOEA/D-2TH, NSGA-II, and SPEA2SDE. This comparison is performed on nine instances with varying scales. By evaluating the algorithm's performance using five evaluation indicators, including hypervolume, inverse generational distance, C-Metric, Spacing, and Spread, we demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of convergence and diversity.

AB Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), which uses a facial video to measure skin reflection variations, is a contactless method formonitoring human cardiovascular activity. Due to its simplicity, convenience and potential in large-scale application, rPPG has gained more attention over the decade. However, the accuracy, reliability, and computational complexity have not reached the expected standards, thus rPPG has a very limited application in the educational field. In order to alleviate this issue, this study proposes an rPPG-based learning fatigue detection system, which consists of the following three modules. First, we propose an rPPG extraction module, which realizes real-time pervasive biomedical signal monitoring. Second, we propose an rPPG reconstruction module, which evaluates heart rate using a hybrid of 1D and 2D deep convolutional neural network approach. Third, we propose a learning fatigue classification module based on multi-source feature fusion, which classifies a learner's state into non-fatigue and fatigue. In order to verify the performance, the proposed system is tested on a self-collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that (i) the accuracy of heart rate evaluation is better than the cutting-edge methods; and (ii) based on both the subject-dependent and independent cross validations, the proposed system succeeded in not only learning person-independent features for fatigue detection but also detecting early fatigue with very high accuracy.

ID SMISHING MESSAGES; SECURITY MODEL
AB The use of short message service (SMS) and e-mail have increased too much over the last decades. 80% of people do not read e-mails while 98% of cell phone users daily read their SMS. However, these communication media are unsafe and can produce malicious attacks called spam. The e-mails that pretend to be from a trusted company to provide "financial or personal information" are phishing e-mails. These e-mails contain some links; users might download malicious software on their computers when they click on them. Most techniques and models are developed to automatically detect these "SMS and e-mails" but none of them achieved 100% accuracy. In previous studies using machine learning (ML), spam detection using a small dataset has resulted in lower accuracy. To counter this problem, in this paper, multiple classifiers of ML and a classifier of deep learning (DL) were applied to the SMS and e-mail dataset for spam detection with higher accuracy. After conducting experiments on the real dataset, the researchers concluded that the proposed system performed better and more accurately than previously existing models. Specifically, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier outperformed all others. These results suggest that SVM is the optimal choice for classification purposes.

AB In this article, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategy for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) path following control is developed. The proposed method learns integrated guidance and heading control policy, which directly maps the USV's navigation states to motor control commands. By introducing a twin-critic design and an integral compensator to the conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, the tracking accuracy and robustness of the controller can be significantly improved. Moreover, a pretrained neural network-based USV model is built to help the learning algorithm efficiently deal with unknown nonlinear dynamics. The self-learning and path following capabilities of the proposed method were validated in both simulations and real sea experiments. The results show that our control policy can achieve better performance than a traditional cascade control policy and a DDPG-based control policy.

AB Hand gestures are widely used in human-to-human and human-to-machine communication. Therefore, hand gesture recognition is a topic of great interest. Hand gesture recognition is closely related to pattern recognition, where overfitting can occur when there are many predictors relative to the size of the training set. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors through feature selection techniques. In addition, the need for portability in hand gesture recognition systems limits the use of deep learning algorithms. In this sense, a study of feature selection and extraction methods is proposed for the use of traditional machine learning algorithms. The feature selection methods analyzed are: maximum relevance and minimum redundancy (MRMR), Sequential, neighbor component analysis without parameters (NCAsp), neighbor component analysis with parameters (NCAp), Relief-F, and decision tree (DT). We also analyze the behavior of feature selection methods using classification and recognition accuracy and processing time. Feature selection methods were fed through seventeen feature extraction functions, which return a score proportional to its importance. The functions are then ranked according to their scores and fed to machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT). This work demonstrates that all feature selection methods evaluated on ANN provide better accuracy. In addition, the combination and number of feature extraction functions influence the accuracy and processing time.

AB Industrial image anomaly detection (AD) is a critical issue that has been investigated in different research areas. Many works have attempted to detect anomalies by simulating anomalous samples. However, how to simulate abnormal samples remains a significant challenge. In this study, a method for simulating anomalous samples is designed. First, for the object category, patch extraction and patch paste are designed to ensure that the extracted image patches come from the objects and are pasted to the objects in the image. Second, based on the statistical analysis of various anomalies' presence, a combination of data augmentation is proposed to cover various anomalies as much as possible. The method is evaluated on MVTec AD and BTAD datasets; the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves an overall detection AUC of 97.6% in MVTec AD datasets, outperforming the baseline by 1.5%, and the improvement over VT-ADL method is 4.3% on the BTAD datasets, demonstrating our method's effectiveness and generalization.

AB With the continuous development of economic globalisation, China has established free trade zones (FTA). To promote the diversification of cross-border e-commerce in FTA and increase industry competitiveness, the Porter's Five Forces model (PFFM) was used to analyse the profit model of e-commerce enterprises. Based on fuzzy logic, an evaluation model for the profit model of cross-border e-commerce was constructed, and this evaluation model was used to evaluate the profitability of cross-border e-commerce. The results show that the evaluation model constructed based on fuzzy logic can better reflect the profitability of enterprises. The accuracy of multilevel fuzzy evaluation is above 80% every year, with the highest accuracy being in 2017, and the evaluation accuracy for that year is 98.5%. The study of a cross-border e-commerce profit evaluation model based on multilevel fuzzy evaluation method can better reflect the profitability of enterprises and help them clarify their future development direction.

AB Fabric defect detection has always been a key issue, and it positively correlated its efficiency with productivity. From manual visual methods to machine vision and deep learning-based techniques, a variety of methods have been studied to improve production efficiency and product quality. Although deep learning-based methods have proven to be powerful tools for segmentation, there are still many pressing issues that need to be addressed in practical applications. First, the scarcity of defective samples compared to normal samples can cause data imbalance and thus affect accuracy. Second, high real-time performance is also required in the actual detection process. To overcome these problems, we propose a high real-time convolutional neural network, named Mobile-Deeplab, to implement end-to-end defect segmentation. In addition, we proposed a loss function to consider the fabric image sample imbalance problem. We evaluated the performance of the model with two public structured datasets and three self-constructed structured datasets. The experimental results show that the segmentation method has better segmentation accuracy than other segmentation models, which verifies the segmentation effect of the method. In addition, 87.11 frames per second on a 256 x 256 size image meet industrial real-time requirements.

AB This work presents a framework for interfacing a reinforcement learning algorithm with a finite element model in order to develop an artificial neural network controller. The goal of the controller is accelerating the hot compression process of the titanium aluminide TNM-B1. The reinforcement learning algorithm interacts with the finite element model by exploring different die velocities and receiving input measurements (the velocity, displacement and force of the die) while collecting rewards if a constant stress state in the workpiece is achieved. Synthetic stochastic material behavior was used to simulate the observed variations in deformation behavior of TNM-B1. The same reinforcement learning setup and reward function was able to adapt to two example finite element environments; the compression of a simple cylinder workpiece between flat dies and the compression of a more complex bone workpiece between flat dies. The performance of the controller for the bone compression environment was comparatively reduced and less consistent. In addition, training times and training instability were significantly increased. Furthermore, the results suggest that the framework can be used as a tool to find process optimizations or alternative process routes. This work demonstrates the concept and provides the groundwork and fundamentals for transferring the method to a physical setup.

Our approach consists of building Classification Trees in which, except for the leaf nodes, the labels are temporarily left out and grouped into two classes by means of a SVM separating hyperplane. We provide a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming formulation for the problem and report the results of an extended battery of computational experiments to assess the performance of our proposal with respect to other benchmarking classification methods.

TI Boundary-restricted metric learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Metric learning; Boundary restriction; Generalization ability;
   Topological property
AB Metric learning aims to learn a distance metric to properly measure the similarities between pairwise examples. Most existing learning algorithms are designed to reduce intra-class distances and meanwhile enlarge inter-class distances by critically introducing a margin between intra-class and inter-class distances. However, such learning objectives may yield boundless (distance) metric space, because their enlargements on inter-class distances are usually unconstrained. In this case, excessively enlarged inter-class distances would relatively reduce the ratio of margin to the whole distance range (i.e., the margin-range-ratio), and thus being against the initial large-margin purpose for discriminating the similarities of data pairs. To address this issue, we propose a new boundary-restricted metric (BRM), which confines the metric space by a restriction function. Such a restriction function is monotonous and gradually converges to an upper bound, which suppresses excessively large distances of data pairs and concurrently maintains the reliable discriminability. After that, the learned metric can be successfully restricted in a finite region, and thereby avoiding the reduction of margin-range-ratio. Theoretically, we prove that BRM tightens the generalization error bound of the traditional learning model without sacrificing the fitting capability or destroying the topological property of the learned metric, which implies that BRM makes a good bias-variance tradeoff for the metric learning task. Extensive experiments on toy data and real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art metric learning methods.

TI How to be fair? A study of label and selection bias
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Algorithmic fairness; Ethical AI; Classification; Fairness-accuracy
   trade-off
AB It is widely accepted that biased data leads to biased and thus potentially unfair models. Therefore, several measures for bias in data and model predictions have been proposed, as well as bias mitigation techniques whose aim is to learn models that are fair by design. Despite the myriad of mitigation techniques developed in the past decade, however, it is still poorly understood under what circumstances which methods work. Recently, Wick et al. showed, with experiments on synthetic data, that there exist situations in which bias mitigation techniques lead to more accurate models when measured on unbiased data. Nevertheless, in the absence of a thorough mathematical analysis, it remains unclear which techniques are effective under what circumstances. We propose to address this problem by establishing relationships between the type of bias and the effectiveness of a mitigation technique, where we categorize the mitigation techniques by the bias measure they optimize. In this paper we illustrate this principle for label and selection bias on the one hand, and demographic parity and "We're All Equal" on the other hand. Our theoretical analysis allows to explain the results of Wick et al. and we also show that there are situations where minimizing fairness measures does not result in the fairest possible distribution.

TI Ranking-preserved generative label enhancement
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Label enhancement; Label distribution learning; Learning with ambiguity;
   Generative model
AB Label distribution learning (LDL) is effective for addressing label ambiguity. In LDL, ground-truth label distributions are hardly available due to the high annotation cost, whereas it is relatively easy to obtain examples with logical labels. Hence, label enhancement (LE) is proposed to automatically transform logical labels into label distributions. Most existing LE methods employ discriminative approaches. However, discriminative approaches specialize in obtaining better predictive performance under supervised learning, and their capability is limited in LE that lacks supervisory information. Therefore, we propose a generative LE model, and infer label distributions by the variational Bayes capable of preserving the label ranking within the logical label vector. Our method consists of a generation process and an inference process. In the generation process, we treat label distributions as latent variables, and assume that label distributions generate logical labels and feature values of the instance itself and logical labels of the neighbors of this instance. In the inference process, we design a function, which mines the label correlation and preserves the label ranking within the logical label vector, to parameterize the variational posterior. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our proposal.

TI State-based episodic memory for multi-agent reinforcement learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Multi-agent; Reinforcement learning; Episodic memory; Sample efficiency
AB Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have made promising progress in recent years by leveraging the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm. However, existing MARL algorithms still suffer from the sample inefficiency problem. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, called state-based episodic memory (SEM), to improve sample efficiency in MARL. SEM adopts episodic memory (EM) to supervise the centralized training procedure of CTDE in MARL. To the best of our knowledge, SEM is the first work to introduce EM into MARL. SEM has lower space complexity and time complexity than state and action based EM (SAEM) initially proposed for single-agent reinforcement learning when using for MARL. Experimental results on two synthetic environments and one real environment show that introducing episodic memory into MARL can improve sample efficiency, and SEM can reduce storage cost and time cost compared with SAEM.

AB Community detection finds homogeneous groups of nodes in a graph. Existing approaches either partition the graph into disjoint, non-overlapping, communities, or determine only overlapping communities. To date, no method supports both detections of overlapping and non-overlapping communities. We propose UCoDe, a unified method for community detection in attributed graphs that detects both overlapping and non-overlapping communities by means of a novel contrastive loss that captures node similarity on a macro-scale. Our thorough experimental assessment on real data shows that, regardless of the data distribution, our method is either the top performer or among the top performers in both overlapping and non-overlapping detection without burdensome hyper-parameter tuning.

AB In this essay, we explore the philosophical and theoretical resonances of the artwork Qatipana from the perspective of some key insights of Gilbert Simondon's information processing system approach. Qatipana (Quechua word that means flow, sequence, transmission) is a hybrid ecosystem of information flow which, even though not the kind of dispositive systems theory was designed to read, offers some valuable empirical insights to test some key aspects of Simondon's information processing systems. In particular, we are interested in observing how Simondon's becoming and individuation play out in an algorithmic cycle performed by the cognitive system of an Artificial Intelligence agent: how does mono-technology and computerization of cultural techniques influence the nature of knowing the affection of being with others (people, things, animals)? We contrast Simondon's contributions with the work of Norbert Wiener and Stafford Beer on information in cybernetics and the cosmotechnics and Technodiversity of Chinese philosopher Yuk Hui. Furthermore, we offer a provisional assessment of the reach, limits, and possibilities this kind of symbiotic crossing of technologies and arts: it is a field filled with challenges and unresolved complexities that should encourage us to recognize the urgency that is implied in the disruptive (and creative) we can see unfolding in social and political life. The already pervasive (and growing) presence of computational systems has become both a tremendous risk and a vertiginous deployment of liberating opportunities. Latin America and elsewhere are desperately calling for an insightful and imaginative engagement.

AB Hybrid aerial-aquatic robots can operate in both air and water and cross between these two. They can be applied to amphibious observation, maritime search and rescue, and cross-domain environmental monitoring. Herein, an aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot is proposed that can fly, swim, and rapidly cross the air-water boundaries (0.16 s) and autonomously attach to surfaces in both air and water. Inspired by the mechanoreceptors of the remora (Echeneis naucrates) disc, the robot's hitchhiking device is equipped with two flexible bioinspired tactile sensors (FBTS) based on a triboelectric nanogenerator for tactile sensing of attachment status. Based on tactile sensing, the robot can perform reattachment after leakage or adhesion failure, enabling it to achieve long-term adhesion on complex surfaces. The rotor-based aerial-aquatic robot, which has two thrust vectoring units for underwater locomotion, can maneuver to pitch, yaw, and roll 360 & DEG; and control precision motion position. The field tests show that the robot can continuously cross the air-water boundary, attach to the rough stone surface, and record video in both air and underwater. This study may shed light on future autonomous robots capable of intelligent navigation, adhesion, and operation in complex aerial-aquatic environments.
   An untethered aerial-aquatic hitchhiking robot that can be remotely controlled for flying, swimming, and transiting air-water boundaries rapidly (0.16 s), is presented.

AB Deep-sea exploration remains a challenging task as the extreme hydrostatic pressure environment, darkness, and suspended sediment launch severely hinder the capability of deep-sea vehicles. As a complement to underwater camera, tactile perception becomes especially important in situations where machine vision is limited. However, tactile sensors utilized in deep sea, which should be able to detect pressure changes of only hundreds of pascals under high hydrostatic pressure, are still lacking. To tackle the challenge imposed by hydrostatic pressure, a simulated deep-sea environment flexible sensor (SDEFS) is proposed, consisting of a force sensor array and a bending sensor based on hydrogels for tactile sensing in 50 MPa hydrostatic pressure environments. The force sensor is unaffected by the hydrostatic pressure and achieves high sensitivity of 82.62 N-1 under 100 MPa hydrostatic pressure. The SDEFS is utilized to classify objects based on the difference in hardness. It can accurately classify seven objects on the ground, and three objects in an underwater environment with hydrostatic pressure of 50 MPa, with total recognition accuracies of 98.3% and 96%, respectively. With high force measurement sensitivity and accurate recognition ability under water, the SDEFS is expected to provide very valuable haptic sensing and feedback in deep-sea exploration.

AB Due to the difficulties in designing sensor arrays with a wide detection range, high sensitivity, and the sensing ability to convert tangential force into normal force on the same substrate, the integration of shape and texture recognitions in one electronic skin (e-skin) has not been realized so far. Herein, an e-skin tactile-sensing system is presented, based on resistive pressure-sensing units (serving as Meissner corpuscles) unevenly distributed on a bionic hand-shaped polyimide substrate, which can realize shape and texture recognitions concurrently. A multilayer microporous structure with different pores is designed and introduced into the sensor, which enables each sensing unit ultrahigh sensitivity and a wide detection range. Meanwhile, a customized micro-pyramid array is developed and assembled to the sensor array, which realizes the transformation from tangential force to normal force. With the help of artificial intelligence technology, the recognition accuracy reaches 100% for 8 different shapes, and 99.7% for 10 different textures, respectively. The proposed design strategy enables compatible fabrication, simple signal processing, and convenient extension of bionic free-shaped e-skin, which paves a promising way for the popularization of e-skin in large-scale intelligent wearable fields.

AB Upscaling of the time-varying volume data is significant, since it can be used in in situ visualization to help scientists fast analyse complex simulations relevant to time-varying volume data. A novel deep learning method called Pix2Pix spatial super-resolution (Pix2PixSSR), which can be used to generate spatial super-resolution of the time-varying volume data is proposed here. It consists of two main components: One is a variant UNet-like generator that takes the low resolution volume sequence as input and generates the high resolution counterparts; one is a PatchGAN discriminator that takes both low and high resolution volume sequences as input and predicts their realness. To validate its advantages, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare it with the state-of-the-art upscaling techniques. More specifically, two experiments are performed. The first experiment uses the same variable of a time-varying volume dataset for training and inference, while the second experiment uses different variables for training and inference. The experimental results show that for most cases, the Pix2PixSSR can generate the most similar super-resolution to the ground truth, compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.
   A novel Generative Adversarial Networks-based method is proposed to synthesize super-resolution of the time-varying volumetric data from complex scientific simulations. The experimental results show that in comparison to the state-of-the-art techniques, this method could generate the most similar results to the ground truth.image

ID UNSUPERVISED DOMAIN
AB Most existing domain adaption methods solve the problem of data distribution similarity in single-source to single-target domain or multi-source to single-target domain adaption, but the more realistic multi-source to multi-target domain transfer scenarios are ignored. At the same time, less attention is paid to the similarity of task distribution among domains and the corresponding relationship between coarse-grained and fine-grained, which leads to the problem of low classification accuracy. In this paper, a multi-source to multi-target domain adaption (MSMTDA) method based on similarity measurement is proposed. Firstly, a cross-domain similarity measurement mechanism based on the idea of data distribution similarity and task distribution similarity is set up to judge and optimize the distribution difference among source domains and target domains. Secondly, global-local-bidirectional alignment is used to solve the problem of poor transfer performance in the existing distributed alignment. Then, the cross-domain mutual learning strategy is proposed, which reduces classifier discrepancy caused by decision boundaries and distribution difference in multiple domains. Finally, the proposed method is verified on three benchmark datasets in image classification. The experimental results show that the proposed method performs better in both classification accuracy and training time when compared with the conventional method.

TI LogBASA: Log Anomaly Detection Based on System Behavior Analysis and
   Global Semantic Awareness
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
ID SUPPORT
AB System log anomaly detection is important for ensuring stable system operation and achieving rapid fault diagnosis. System log sequences include data on the execution paths and time stamps of system tasks in addition to a large amount of semantic information, which enhances the reliability and effectiveness of anomaly detection. At the same time, considering the correlation between system log sequences can effectively improve fault diagnosis efficiency. However, the existing system log anomaly detection methods mostly consider only the sequence patterns or semantic information on the logs, so their anomaly detection results show a high rate of missed and false alarms. To solve these problems, this paper proposed an unsupervised log anomaly detection model (LogBASA) based on the system behavior analysis and global semantic awareness, aiming to decrease the leakage rate and increase the log sequence anomaly detection accuracy. First, a system log knowledge graph was constructed based on massive, unstructured, and multilevel system log data to represent log sequence patterns, which facilitates subsequent anomaly detection and localization. Then, a self-attention encoder-decoder transformer model was developed for log spatiotemporal association analysis. This model combines semantic mapping and spatiotemporal features of log sequences to analyze system behavior and log semantics in multiple dimensions. Furthermore, a system log anomaly detection method that combines adaptive spatial boundary delineation and sequence reconstruction objective functions was proposed. This method uses special words to characterize the log sequence states, delineates anomaly boundaries automatically, and reconstructs log sequences through unsupervised training for anomaly detection. Finally, the proposed method was verified by numerous experiments on three real datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method can achieve an accuracy rate of 99.3%, 95.1%, and 97.2% on HDFS, BGL, and Thunderbird datasets, which proves the effectiveness and superiority of the LogBASA model.

AB Appearance-based gaze estimation has been widely studied recently with promising performance. The majority of appearance-based gaze estimation methods are developed under the deterministic frameworks. However, the deterministic gaze estimation methods suffer from large performance drop upon challenging eye images in low-resolution, darkness, partial occlusions, etc. To alleviate this problem, in this article, we alternatively reformulate the appearance-based gaze estimation problem under a generative framework. Specifically, we propose a variational inference model, that is, variational gaze estimation network (VGE-Net), to generate multiple gaze maps as complimentary candidates simultaneously supervised by the ground-truth gaze map. To achieve robust estimation, we adaptively fuse the gaze directions predicted on these candidate gaze maps by a regression network through a simple attention mechanism. Experiments on three benchmarks, that is, MPIIGaze, EYEDIAP, and Columbia, demonstrate that our VGE-Net outperforms state-of-the-art gaze estimation methods, especially on challenging cases. Comprehensive ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of our contributions. The code will be publicly released.

TI Knowledge-Embedded Mutual Guidance for Visual Reasoning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS

AB Visual reasoning between visual images and natural language is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. Most of the methods aim to look for answers to questions only on the basis of the analysis of the offered questions and images. Other approaches treat knowledge graphs as flattened tables to search for the answer. However, there are two major problems with these works: 1) the model disregards the fact that the world we surrounding us interlinks our hearing and speaking of natural language and 2) the model largely ignores the structure of the KG. To overcome these challenging deficiencies, a model should jointly consider two modalities of vision and language, as well as the rich structural and logical information embedded in knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a general joint representation learning framework for visual reasoning, namely, knowledge-embedded mutual guidance. It realizes mutual guidance not only between visual data and natural language descriptions but also between knowledge graphs and reasoning models. In addition, it exploits the knowledge derived from the reasoning model to boost knowledge graphs when applying the visual relation detection task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs dramatically better than state-of-the-art methods on two benchmarks for visual reasoning.

ID MODEL
AB The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model, pretrained on large visual text corpora, has demonstrated significant improvements in visual and linguistic tasks and has been applied to various downstream tasks. At least two issues, however, hinder the transfer learning with such powerful pretrained models in the field of medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). That current methods tend to full fine-tune these large-scale models are suffering from increasingly expensive computational cost as the model size grows in development. Additionally, published Med-VQA datasets are small that may lead to overfitting when directly fine-tuning on them. In this article, we integrate two designs and propose an efficient transfer learning method for Med-VQA named VQA-Adapter. To alleviate training costs, we introduce a novel and parameter-efficient adapter component into Med-VQA. During training, only the proposed light-weight adapter needs to be tuned, while all parameters in the large-scale visual model of CLIP could be kept frozen. We further design a multi-stage label smoothing paradigm for Med-VQA to deal with the overfitting issue in small Med-VQA datasets. Experimental results on two popular Med-VQA datasets, i.e., VQA-RAD and SLAKE, demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods on both open-ended and closed-ended question answering tasks. Furthermore, compared to directly fine-tuning the entire CLIP model, our approach only requires to update 2.38% of the parameters. Extensive ablation studies, analysis and visualizations convincingly demonstrate the great potential of designing light-weight frameworks to transfer large-scale pretrained models from natural vision-language tasks to domain-specific medical applications.

ID ACTION RECOGNITION
AB This work pays the first research effort to address unsupervised 3-D action representation learning with point cloud sequence, which is different from existing unsupervised methods that rely on 3-D skeleton information. Our proposition is built on the state-of-the-art 3-D action descriptor 3-D dynamic voxel (3DV) with contrastive learning (CL). The 3DV can compress the point cloud sequence into a compact point cloud of 3-D motion information. Spatiotemporal data augmentations are conducted on it to drive CL. However, we find that existing CL methods (e.g., SimCLR or MoCo v2) often suffer from high pattern variance toward the augmented 3DV samples from the same action instance, that is, the augmented 3DV samples are still of high feature complementarity after CL, while the complementary discriminative clues within them have not been well exploited yet. To address this, a feature augmentation adapted CL (FACL) approach is proposed, which facilitates 3-D action representation via concerning the features from all augmented 3DV samples jointly, in spirit of feature augmentation. FACL runs in a global-local way: one branch learns global feature that involves the discriminative clues from the raw and augmented 3DV samples, and the other focuses on enhancing the discriminative power of local feature learned from each augmented 3DV sample. The global and local features are fused to characterize 3-D action jointly via concatenation. To fit FACL, a series of spatiotemporal data augmentation approaches is also studied on 3DV. Wide-range experiments verify the superiority of our unsupervised learning method for 3-D action feature learning. It outperforms the state-of-the-art skeleton-based counterparts by 6.4% and 3.6% with the cross-setup and cross-subject test settings on NTU RGB + D 120, respectively.

AB Due to cyber-physical fusion and nonsmooth characteristics of energy management, this article proposes a security event-trigger-based distributed approach to address these issues with developed smoothing technique. To tackle with nonconvex and nondifferentiable issue, a randomized gradient-free-based successive convex approximation is developed to smooth economic objective function. Due to resilience ability against security issue, a security event-triggered mechanism-based distributed energy management is proposed to optimize social welfare, which coordinately controls both power generators and load demand. The security event-triggered mechanism is designed to reduce power system security risks, and relieve communication burden caused by smoothing calculation, the convergence of proposed distributed algorithm is also properly proved. According to those obtained results on both IEEE 9-bus and IEEE 39-bus systems, it reveals that the proposed approach can achieve good convergence performance and have less security risks than other alternatives, which also proves that the proposed approach can be a viable and promising way for tackling with energy management issue of cyber-physical isolated power system.

AB This article investigates the online learning and energy-efficient control issues for nonlinear discrete-time multiagent systems (MASs) with unknown dynamics models and antagonistic interactions. First, a distributed combined measurement error function is formulated using the signed graph theory to transfer the bipartite formation issue into a consensus issue. Then, an enhanced linearization controller model for the controlled MASs is developed by employing dynamic linearization technology. After that, an online learning adaptive event-triggered (ET) actor-critic neural network (AC-NN) framework for the MASs to implement bipartite formation control tasks is proposed by employing the optimized NNs and designed adaptive ET mechanism. Moreover, the convergence of the designed formation control framework is strictly proved by the constructed Lyapunov functions. Finally, simulation and experimental studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB This paper proposes LHFNet, an improved object detection method based on CenterNet, which achieves a better speed-accuracy trade-off. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: We design a lightweight Hourglass network to reduce the number of parameters and computations of CenterNet, thus improving the detection speed. We introduce an intermediate feature map fusion module to enhance the feature extraction capability of Hourglass, which compensates for the possible performance degradation caused by the network simplification. We apply an attention module to the final heat map to improve the image feature representation. We design and optimize a series of loss functions to train LHFNet effectively. Through the research in this paper, we demonstrate that the feature map fusion and the attention module greatly improve the performance of LHFNet. We evaluate our method on the COCO dataset and achieve a high accuracy at a fast speed (Tesla V100), which outperforms other object detection methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

AB Early detection and diagnosis are the key factors in decreasing the breast cancer mortality rate in medical image analysis. A randomized learning technique called extreme learning machine (ELM) plays a vital role in learning the single hidden layer feed-forward network with fast learning speed and good generalization. The input weight and bias are randomly generated and fixed during the ELM training phase, and subsequently, the analytical procedure determines the output weight. The extreme learning machine's learning ability is based on three uncertainty factors: the number of hidden nodes, an input weight initialization, and the type of activation function in the hidden layer. Various breast classification works have experimented with extreme learning machine techniques and did not investigate the following factors. This paper evaluates the extreme learning machine model's performance with different configurations on the standard ultra-sound breast cancer dataset, BUSI. The proposed extreme learning machine configuration model experimented on original and filtered ultra-sound images. A fivefold stratified cross-validation scheme is applied here to enhance the model's generalization performance. The proposed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model provides 100% accuracy with the best extreme learning machine configurations. Then, we compare the classification results of the proposed model with typical variants of extreme learning machines like Hybrid ELM (HELM), online-sequential ELM (OS-ELM), Weighted ELM, and complex ELM (CELM). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed extreme learning machine model is superior to existing models, offering good generalization without any feature extraction or reduction method.

AB In many application domains, there is an urgent need for data owners to mine attribute associations hidden in linguistic conceptual knowledge. Numerous linguistically valued facts from the actual world have been modeled using the fuzzy linguistic approach. To solve the problem of association rule mining with fuzzy linguistic information, this paper proposes an association rule mining approach based on fuzzy linguistic attribute partial ordered structure diagram (FL-APOSD). First, complex relationships between linguistic values in association rule mining are represented by fuzzy linguistic association nodes and association paths via FL-APOSD. On this basis, the maximum frequent attribute set is mined from the FL-APOSD, and then the non-redundancy association rules are extracted. Second, to show the information hidden in the rules and help users to deeply understand the mining results, a fuzzy linguistic association rule visualization approach is proposed to convert the association rules into the FL-APOSD-based knowledge representation. Finally, experimental results on real-world datasets show the proposed approach's high efficiency, outperforming two relevant state-of-the-art approaches.

AB The development of college students' and adolescents' mental and physical health is of prime importance and has a crucial role in China's progression. Different types of teachings and methods are envisioned and implemented to achieve this milestone. These methods include therapy and counseling, stress management, mediation, physical activities and creative activities. Music teaching is one of the methods that is used to improve the quality of human mental health. Initially, this research study defines the music teachings and the methods utilized for imparting music teachings. It elaborates on the importance of mental health, issues due to mental health, and their causes in college students. Second, it studies the relationship between music teachings and human physiology. It presents theories of human physiology and algorithms for measuring the quality of human mental health. Third, this study evaluates the impact of music teachings on the mental growth of adolescents and performs statistical analysis using big data in a three-tier fashion. It consists of the Assessment Session Check-In mental health test model, mental health analysis theory, and theory of favorable environment. The study also incorporates the 90-category symptom self-assessment analysis (SCL-90) and the self-measurement health rating analysis calculation method and uses SQL Server for statistical implementation. Finally, an evaluation study compares adolescents with and without music teachings using three parameters, i.e., physical health, mental health, and physiology. The statistical results are compared with results obtained from the existing statistical methods, which reveal that mental health gains are visible, with music study students outperforming ordinary students by 20% on the SCL-90 and having 14% higher mental health index scores. The comprehensive mental health score shows a significant 18% improvement over time. After two years of music instruction, the number of psychologically unwell pupils dropped by 28%, and extreme psychological issues has substantially decreased by 50% or more. This study can significantly improve students' understanding and approach to mental health, particularly in music education. It provides compelling evidence of the positive impact of music study on mental well-being, potentially influencing educational practices and policies.

AB Many researchers have shown interest in profile monitoring; however, most of the applications in this field of research are developed under the assumption of normal response variable. Little attention has been given to profile monitoring with non-normal response variables, known as general linear models which consists of two main categories (i.e., logistic and Poisson profiles). This paper aims to monitor Poisson profile monitoring problem in Phase II and develops a new robust control chart using support vector regression by incorporating some novel input features and evolutionary training algorithm. The new method is quicker in detecting out-of-control signals as compared to conventional statistical methods. Moreover, the performance of the proposed scheme is further investigated for Poisson profiles with both fixed and random explanatory variables as well as non-parametric profiles. The proposed monitoring scheme is revealed to be superior to its counterparts, including the likelihood ratio test (LRT), multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA), LRT-EWMA and other machine learning-based schemes. The simulation results show superiority of the proposed method in profiles with fixed explanatory variables and non-parametric models in nearly all situations while it is not able to be the best in all the simulations when there are with random explanatory variables. A diagnostic method with machine learning approach is also used to identify the parameters of change in the profile. It is shown that the proposed profile diagnosis approach is able to reach acceptable results in comparison with other competitors. A real-life example in monitoring Poisson profiles is also provided to illustrate the implementation of the proposed charting scheme.

AB Understanding the nature of meaning and its extensions (with metaphor as one typical kind) has been one core issue in figurative language study since Aristotle's time. This research takes a computational cognitive perspective to model metaphor based on the assumption that meaning is perceptual, embodied, and encyclopedic. We model word meaning representation for metaphor detection with embodiment information obtained from behavioral experiments. Our work is the first attempt to incorporate sensorimotor knowledge into neural networks for metaphor detection, and demonstrates superiority, consistency, and interpretability compared to peer systems based on two general datasets. In addition, with cross-sectional analysis of different feature schemas, our results suggest that metaphor, as a device of cognitive conceptualization, can be 'learned' from the perceptual and actional information independent of several more explicit levels of linguistic representation. The access to such knowledge allows us to probe further into word meaning mapping tendencies relevant to our conceptualization and reaction to the physical world.

AB Recently, the keystroke biometric authentication system is the notable research area because of it is low cost and flexible integration support. Keystroke gratitude is one of the branches of biometrics that is considered to support regular passwords which mainly used for continuous authentication scenarios like online examination and military intelligence. Numerous studies have been conducted on the basis of data acquisition tools, character representation, classification methods, test protocols, and evaluations. Furthermore, the classification of biometric data is always difficult because this information is often mismatched and depends on human behavior. A private keystroke is difficult to perform and can be used for authentication. In this paper, we propose a hybrid machine learning technique for multiple soft biometric based dynamic keystroke pattern recognition system as a novelty of this study. We propose a novel multi-objective swarm optimization algorithm to select optimal features among multiple features of keystrokes. We extract different soft biometric features such as age, color, gender, weight, height and race from the users. We illustrate an optimal Cat induced whale optimization algorithm to fuse the optimal weight features of multiple biometric responses. We propose an optimal learning based recurrent neural network (OL-RNN) classifier to recognize the keystroke patterns. Finally, the performance of proposed OL-RNN classifier is compare with the obtainable state-of-art classifiers n conditions of dissimilar performance metrics.

AB Pathfinder algorithm (PFA) is a recently introduced meta-heuristic technique that mimics the cooperative behavior of animal groups in search of the best food area. PFA consists of two phases, namely, the path-finder phase and the follower phase. The former explores new search regions through its versatile explorative power, while in the latter stage, followers change their position by tracking the leader and using their perception. However, PFA is prone to falling into local optima, leading to a slow convergence rate while dealing with high-dimensional ill-conditioned problems. Therefore, this article proposes an improved PFA called ASDR-PFA based on an adaptation of the search dimensional ratio (ASDR) to address the issues in PFA. The proposed method incorporates an ASDR concept that uses a search dimensional ratio (SDR) parameter to generate new candidate solutions using the existing global best. Its strength lies in its dynamic updating of the SDR parameter, which further tunes the balance between exploration and exploitation processes. As a result, the convergence rate of PFA is enhanced. The effectiveness of ASDR-PFA is verified using a set of 16 basic benchmark functions and IEEE-CEC-2011 and IEEE-CEC-2017 problem suites. Wilcoxon's signed rank test is also conducted to confirm its statistical significance. Additionally, ASDR-PFA is utilized to tackle some optimal feature selection problems to substantiate its applicability. Too, a comparative assessment of empirical outcomes attained through ASDR-PFA and some modern meta-heuristics is carried out to showcase its suitability level.

AB Accurate forecasting of the enrollment scale of higher education and education expenditure is the key to scientific decision-making in education. Nevertheless, education data sets are usually small and affected by uncertainties including economy, education system policies, and so on, which result in difficulty in modeling. To address the tissues, we presented a novel time-delayed grey model based on a fractional-order accumulation time term, abbreviated as FHTDGM. The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the particle swarm optimization. The experiment's results show that the FHTDGM model can fit and forecast enrollment scale and educational spending data with greater accuracy than a group of other grey models, and the forecast MAPEs are 2.396 and 1.244, respectively.

AB Container transport is the most environmentally friendly and sustainable way to transport bulk cargo currently. The accurate prediction of container throughput is of great significance to the operation of the port. It is directly related to the healthy development of the entire logistics system, and also serves as a reference for decision makers in the construction of port infrastructure. However, the container throughput sequence contains the influence and restriction of a variety of superimposed factors, and has the characteristics of nonlinear and nonstationary. Traditional technology cannot effectively capture the changes of external related factors. To make up for the deficiencies, a multi-variable hybrid deterministic and uncertain forecasting framework based on improved preprocessing technique and swarm intelligence optimizer is constructed. It not only considers the impact of port hinterland economic indicators, port transport system and transport capacity factors, but also calculates the upper and lower limits of container throughput under different probabilities. The results and tests show that mean absolute percentage errors obtained by the presented forecast system are 1.1551%, 2.0936% and 2.5546% respectively, and the prediction interval coverage probability values of 1 can be achieved. The hybrid system is effective, stable and has reasonable running time, which can be widely popularized. And it is conducive to the orderly operation of transportation industry and the development of container port cities.

DE Determinant point processes; diversity; graph neural networks (GNNs);
   negative sampling
AB Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning by extracting high-level features from nodes and their topology. Since GCNs generally follow a message-passing mechanism, each node aggregates information from its first-order neighbor to update its representation. As a result, the representations of nodes with edges between them should be positively correlated and thus can be considered positive samples. However, there are more non-neighbor nodes in the whole graph, which provide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two non-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as negative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information of the graph is also crucial for learning. In this article, we used quality-diversity decomposition in determinant point processes (DPPs) to obtain diverse negative samples. When defining a distribution on diverse subsets of all non-neighboring nodes, we incorporate both graph structure information and node representations. Since the DPP sampling process requires matrix eigenvalue decomposition, we propose a new shortest-path-base method to improve computational efficiency. Finally, we incorporate the obtained negative samples into the graph convolution operation. The ideas are evaluated empirically in experiments on node classification tasks. These experiments show that the newly proposed methods not only improve the overall performance of standard representation learning but also significantly alleviate over-smoothing problems.

AB In this paper, we present a new approach to robot motion planning that anticipates the use of visionbased feedback control during task execution. We accomplish this by incorporating an image-based visual servo (IBVS) controller directly into the steering function used by a Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner. Our approach requires a number of extensions to traditional RRT-style planning. First, we derive a new sampling strategy that augments the usual state information by including image features that will be used by the IBVS control law. These augmented samples are then used by our new IBVS steering function, which simulates an IBVS control law to generate local trajectories that extend the current tree. These trajectories must be validated to ensure that they are collision-free and that all image features remain unoccluded and within the camera field of view throughout the local trajectory. We also provide a formal proof showing that the proposed approach is probabilistically complete. We have applied our approach to the problem of planning trajectories for three different systems: a robotic arm, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a car-like robot, which are equipped with an IBVS control law. We explore performance trade-offs in the control design via simulation studies and demonstrate real-world effectiveness via experiments in which a small-scale car-like robot uses IBVS to navigate a track that includes a number of obstacles and potential occlusions. By exploring performance trade-offs, we mean that several elements, such as the metric used to identify nearest neighbors in the RRT and the steering method used to generate nodes, are tested and compared.

AB Integrating robots into our daily lives, once a distant dream, is gradually becoming a reality, surpassing our initial expectations. Today, we aspire for these robots to not only perform rudimentary tasks but to emulate human behavior, and in some aspects, even exceed it. The realm of research dedicated to achieving human-like competencies in robots has given rise to the fields of Developmental and Cognitive Robotics. These domains find their foundation in cognitive architectures and insights from human development. Despite the substantial progress in these fields, a conspicuous gap exists in the literature related to the evaluation of cognitive architectures and the advanced capabilities exhibited by robots. Recognizing this void, we aim at establishing a bridge between the insights gleaned from human developmental theories and the potential applications in robotics. Central to our investigation is the notion that learning follows a cumulative trajectory of escalating complexity. Consequently, our focus centers on the early stages of human development, particularly within the realm of children aged 0 to 2 years. Drawing inspiration from Piaget's constructivist theory aligned with empirical studies in the Developmental Robotics domain, we unveil a framework that facilitates the classification of these studies. In light of this, we curate a series of progressive experiments, mirroring the motor and cognitive growth exhibited by children from birth to two years of age, to be conducted with robots. We also described a methodology for designing these experiments considering the robotics aspects.

AB Reading is a foundational skill and the focus of school-level education efforts across countries. The assessment of linguistic competence from oral reading has long been the subject of scientific studies linking the reader's comprehension of the text to various measures of oral reading fluency. Given the time and resource intensive nature of such assessment, it is of interest to automate the prediction of reading fluency from audio recordings using the same pedagogical rubrics. Given recent findings about the importance of prosody to the communicative purpose of reading aloud, we discuss new approaches to modeling it reliably for the automatic assessment task. We present a new data set of children's oral reading screened for minimum word decoding skill and rated for comprehensibility by two human experts. We develop a system for the automatic prediction of rater scores that also facilitates insights about the complementarity and inter-dependence of computed lexical accuracy, rate and prosodic features as corroborated by multiple performance measures. With achieved values of correlation and agreement that surpass the corresponding inter-rater measures, we also show how text-dependent prosodic features, informed by speech rate and speaking style, contribute prominently to system performance.

AB Malicious nodes launching selective forwarding attacks jeopardize network reliability in event-driven wireless sensor networks. Swift detection and exclusion of these nodes are vital, especially in harsh environments where normal nodes also suffer from decreased forwarding rates due to poor channel conditions. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a deep belief network (DBN) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) based detection scheme against selective forwarding attacks under harsh environments. The DBN algorithm extracts and analyzes behavior features of nodes, while the DBSCAN clustering algorithm effectively distinguishes between malicious and normal nodes during selective forwarding attacks. Simulation results demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness with a missed detection rate (MDR) of approximately 2% and a false detection rate (FDR) below 5% in harsh environments, providing a robust solution for ensuring the integrity and efficiency of data transmission in event-driven wireless sensor networks.

AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as one of the most prominent research areas in accomplishing machine learning tasks over graphical networks. GNNs are prominently used in performing tasks like semi -supervised node classification, link prediction, and community detection. GraphSAGE is one of the most recent GNN models which is being used to accomplish these tasks. A floor plan is an architectural design of a building that represents various floor compartments. In this paper, we represent floor plan(s) as graph(s). We characterize floor room (compartment) classification as a node classification problem. We propose a variation of the traditional GraphSAGE (sample and aggregation) algorithm: Centrality based GraphSAGE (CB -SAGE), which captures the structural properties of the network. We use the average clustering coefficient and average betweenness centrality to capture structure properties. We compute CB scores for all the floor plan graphs. Top 70% nodes (based on CB scores) are selected for the training. During the training, we append the betweenness centrality score of each node as an additional feature in the feature matrix for the embedding process. We conduct experiments on the House-GAN dataset, which contains 1,43,184 vectorized floor plan images. The proposed method outperforms the current state-of-art models in accomplishing the task of floor plan classification. We compare our results with the traditional machine learning approach (MLP) and other GNN-based methods. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 96.70%, which is significantly (approximately 16%) higher than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Homicide involving multiple victims has a significant negative effect on society. Criminal profiling consists of determining the traits of an unknown offender based on those of the crime and the victims, with a view to their identification. To provide the most likely profile of the perpetrator of a multi-victim homicide, we propose a predictive model of supervised machine learning based on a Bayesian Network. Conventional classifiers can generate the perpetrator's profile according to the traits of each of the victims of the same homicide, but the profiles may differ from one another. To address this issue, we consider the Multi-Instance (MI) learning framework, in which the victims of the same incident form a bag, and each bag is associated with a unique label for each of the perpetrator's features. We introduce the unanimity MI assumption in this domain, and accordingly allocate a label to the bag based on the labels and probabilities the Bayesian Network has assigned its instances, using a combination rule from those of the ensemble of classifiers. We apply this methodology to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) homicide database to compare three combination rules empirically in the validation process, as well as theoretically, using the one that ultimately proves to be the best to build the final model, which is then applied in some illustrative examples to achieve the criminal profile.

   font generation
AB The process of designing fonts traditionally requires a great deal of manpower, taking up to one year to complete one style set. In computer vision (CV) and computer graphics (CG), the automatic generation of Chinese fonts with a large number of complex glyphs remains a challenging and persistent problem. In this article, we propose an end-to-end network for generating 9169 Chinese characters without the need for human intervention. Due to the similarity of the strokes of the Chinese characters, different strokes will be recognized as the same type of stroke, resulting in errors. In this article maps the semantic information of Chinese character stroke categories to different stages of the encoder and adjusts the stroke category semantics in specific channels to ensure the synthesis of correct strokes. A deformation attention Skip-connection module was designed to adapt to font generation tasks by learning offsets in features from the decoder and encoder, weights in a cross-channel interactive manner, and adaptively re-scaling features using the learned weights and offsets. There are only a few parameters involved in this method, but it provides significant performance improvements. Compared to the prior art, the method employed by us outperforms it in terms of generating commercial fonts and handwritten fonts, which can help font designers with font design and improve the efficiency of font libraries.

AB Bias in textual data can lead to skewed interpretations and outcomes when the data is used. These biases could perpetuate stereotypes, discrimination, or other forms of unfair treatment. An algorithm trained on biased data may end up making decisions that disproportionately impact a certain group of people. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and remove these biases to ensure the fair and ethical use of data. To this end, we develop a comprehensive and robust framework Nbias that consists of four main layers: data, corpus construction, model development and an evaluation layer. The dataset is constructed by collecting diverse data from various domains, including social media, healthcare, and job hiring portals. As such, we applied a transformer-based token classification model that is able to identify bias words/phrases through a unique named entity BIAS. In the evaluation procedure, we incorporate a blend of quantitative and qualitative measures to gauge the effectiveness of our models. We achieve accuracy improvements ranging from 1% to 8% compared to baselines. We are also able to generate a robust understanding of the model functioning. The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of biases and contributes to the fair and ethical use of textual data.

AB 3D point clouds are a crucial type of data collected by LiDAR sensors and widely used in transportation applications due to its concise descriptions and accurate localization. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing large amount of disordered and sparse 3D point clouds, especially in various computer vision tasks, such as pedestrian detection and vehicle recognition. Among all the learning paradigms, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), an unsupervised training paradigm that mines effective information from the data itself, is considered as an essential solution to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive data labeling problems via smart pre-training task design. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances on SSL for point clouds. We first present an innovative taxonomy, categorizing the existing SSL methods into four broad categories based on the pretexts' characteristics. Under each category, we then further categorize the methods into more fine-grained groups and summarize the strength and limitations of the representative methods. We also compare the performance of the notable SSL methods in literature on multiple downstream tasks on benchmark datasets both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we propose a number of future research directions based on the identified limitations of existing SSL research on point clouds.

DE Contact torque sensing; Extended state observer; Neural network;

ID NONLINEAR DISTURBANCE OBSERVER; COLLISION DETECTION
AB Contact torque sensing allows robot manipulators to cooperate with humans and detect accidental collisions in real time to ensure safety. Most sensorless torque estimation schemes, which are based on linear observer approaches, cannot compromise between non-negligible noise and high observation bandwidth. Therefore, fast time-varying nonlinear torque observation cannot be satisfied. To achieve this challenge, a customized network called FOESO-Net based on a novel fractional-order extended state observer is carefully designed in this paper. The network firstly chooses momentum as the benchmark state for torque estimation, which can avoid joint acceleration and model's inverse inertia matrix solution. Then, a fractional-order extended state observer (FOESO) is proposed from the perspective of momentum control to better adapt to the nonlinear fast time varying torque. In addition, a fractional-order neural network and a weight update neural network parallel architecture are constructed to enable fractional-order and dynamic weight-based adaptive learning of FOESO parameters. Formal analysis and proofs are made to show that the error of FOESO-Net is convergent. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by numerical simulations and a real collaborative robot platform. Moreover, compared with existing methods, the FOESO-Net based torque estimation method can reduce the estimation error and response time, which illustrates the superiority of the designed method.

DE Sparse coding; Associative memory; Autoencoders; Brain-inspired models
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; ASSEMBLIES; MODELS
AB One of the most well established brain principles, Hebbian learning, has led to the theoretical concept of neural assemblies. Based on it, many interesting brain theories have spawned. Palm's work implements this concept through multiple binary Willshaw associative memories, in a model that not only has a wide cognitive explanatory power but also makes neuroscientific predictions. Yet, Willshaw's associative memory can only achieve top capacity when the stored vectors are extremely sparse (number of active bits can grow logarithmically with the vector's length). This strict requirement makes it difficult to apply any model that uses this associative memory, like Palm's, to real data. Hence the fact that most works apply the memory to optimal randomly generated codes that do not represent any information. This issue creates the need for encoders that can take real data, and produce sparse representations - a problem which is also raised following Barlow's efficient coding principle. In this work, we propose a biologically-constrained network that encodes images into codes that are suitable for Willshaw's associative memory. The network is organized into groups of neurons that specialize on local receptive fields, and learn through a competitive scheme. After conducting autoand hetero-association experiments on two visual data sets, we can conclude that our network not only beats sparse coding baselines, but also that it comes close to the performance achieved using optimal random codes.

ID IMPUTATION
AB Accurate estimation of in-hospital mortality based on patients' physiological time series data improves the performance of the clinical decision support systems and assists hospital providers in allocating resources. In practice, the data quality issues of missing values are ubiquitous in electronic health records (EHRs). Since the vital signs are usually observed with irregular temporal intervals and different sampling rates, it is challenging to predict clinical outcomes with sparse and incomplete multivariate time series. We propose an auto-regressive recurrent neural network (RNN) based model, dubbed the bi-directional recursive encoder-decoder network (BiRED), to jointly perform data imputation and mortality prediction. To capture complex patterns of medical time sequences, a 2D cross-regression with an RNN unit (2DCR-RNN) and an imputation block with an RNN unit (IB-RNN) are designed as the recurrent component of the encoder and decoder, respectively. Furthermore, a state initialization method is proposed to alleviate errors accumulated in the generated sequence. The experimental results on two real EHR datasets show that our proposed method can predict hospital mortality with high AUC scores.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid growth of educational data creates the requirement to mine useful information from learning behavior patterns. The development of data mining technology makes educational data mining possible. The paper intends to use a public educational data set to study learning behavior patterns from the perspective of educational data mining, so as to promote the innovation of educational management. Firstly, in order to reduce the dimension of data analysis that facilitates the improvement in efficiency, principal component analysis is carried out to reduce the number of attributes in the data set. The significant attributes in the rotating principal component matrix rather than principal components which are not closely related to learning behavior patterns are extracted as the research variables. Then, a pseudo statistic is proposed to determine the number of clusters and the preprocessed data set is clustered according to the extracted attributes. The clustering results are applied to add class labels to the data, which is convenient for the later data training. Finally, six classification algorithms J48, K-Nearest Neighbor, Bayes Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logit Boost are used to train the data with labels and build prediction models. At the same time, the performance and applicable conditions of six classifiers in terms of accuracy, efficiency, error, and so on are discussed and compared. It is found that the performance of the integrated algorithm is better than that of a single classifier. In the integrated algorithm, compared with Random Forest, the running time of Logit Boost is shorter.

   Thermal images
AB Hotspot detection using thermal imaging has recently become essential in several industrial applications, such as security applications that require identification of suspicious activities or intruders by detecting hotspots generated by human body heat, health applications such as screening of individuals in quarantine environments for onset of fever, and equipment monitoring applications where ensuring smooth operation and preventing potential malfunction by assessing temperature distribution in equipment is important. Hotspot detection is of utmost importance in industrial safety where equipment can develop anomalies. Hotspots are early indicators of such anomalies. We address the problem of hotspot detection in thermal images by proposing a self-supervised learning approach. Self-supervised learning has shown potential as a competitive alternative to their supervised learning counterparts but their application to thermography has been limited. This has been due to lack of diverse data availability, domain specific pre-trained models, standardized benchmarks, etc. We propose a self-supervised representation learning approach followed by fine-tuning that improves detection of hotspots by classification. The SimSiam network based ensemble classifier decides whether an image contains hotspots or not. Detection of hotspots is followed by precise hotspot isolation. By doing so, we are able to provide a highly accurate and precise hotspot identification, applicable to a wide range of applications. We created a novel large thermal image dataset to address the issue of paucity of easily accessible thermal images. Our experiments with the dataset created by us and a publicly available segmentation dataset show the potential of our approach for hotspot detection and its ability to isolate hotspots with high accuracy. We achieve a Dice Coefficient of 0.736, the highest when compared with existing hotspot identification techniques.

AB Acoustic manipulation has emerged as a promising microtarget control method with potential applications in microchip assembly, noncontact control of chemical materials, and cell control. However, the precision of acoustic micro-/nano-manipulation is constrained by the ambiguity of the acoustic displacement field. The nonlinear properties of displacement fields cannot be appropriately simulated using conventional mathematical fitting techniques. In this study, considering the complexity of particle motion on a thin plate driven by acoustic waves, the original displacement dataset was collected based on an experimental platform and was then trained using a neural network to model the displacement of unknown points on the plate. The corresponding cost functions were designed based on a manipulation task and particle number to determine the frequency sequence and achieve motion control of micro/nano targets by selecting the driving frequency with the lowest cost during the controlling process. Based on the above predictions and control effects, the acoustic manipulation platform constructed in this study could be used to manipulate the linear motion of a single particle and control multiple particle encounters as well as to manipulate the complex trajectory "NK". This work opens up an accessible path for an acoustic displacement field and enables achievable microtarget motion control.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB Anomaly detection on metro railway tracks is crucial to maintain the safety of train transportation. Unsupervised methods require separate models for various scenarios, rendering them unsuitable for unified detection in the variable trackway scenario. The problem of "abnormal reconstruction"persists in the unified detection model, which preserves abnormal features in the output and hinders the model's ability to recognize anomalies. In addition, real-time capability is still a huge challenge currently faced. In this study, we present a unified model, MemFormer, that employs a memory module, layer-wise normal queries, and a cascade convolution based multi-head self-attention mechanism (CC-MHSA) to overcome the aforementioned issues. Firstly, a memory module is constructed to store diverse normal features that aid in the uniform modeling of a decision boundary for various scenarios. Secondly, we utilized the normal features existed in the memory module and layer-wise normal queries to optimize the attention mechanism, which suppresses the reconstruction of abnormal features. Thirdly, the proposed CC-MHSA benefits from cascaded convolution to improve feature representation and reduce parameter size, thereby reshaping self-attention calculation and reducing model inference time. Under the unified case, our method achieved detection accuracy of {99.2%, 97.5%} and localization accuracy of {99.7%, 97.1%}, respectively, on the metro trackway foreign object anomaly detection dataset and MVTec-AD dataset. The model infer speed is 47.6 FPS, exceeding that of the state-of-the-art alternatives.

AB Plastic litter and its associated environmental hazards have garnered global attention in recent highlighting the need for effective management. Improper handling of plastic litter can lead to environmental degradation, making it crucial to address this issue. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach predict the spatial distribution and quantity of plastic litter at the city level by leveraging crowd-sensing data and designing a graph neural network-based model. Meteorological data is specifically used to enhance temporal correlation, while the spatial distribution of litter is clustered using the K-means method to capture spatial correlation. For each cluster, multiple graphs are constructed based on the points of interest and litter distribution within the cluster. Graph attention neural networks and heterogeneous graph attention networks are then utilized to aggregate the adjacency information and overall structural information of graphs, respectively. Finally, the litter prediction results are obtained through multiple fully connected Real-world experiments convincingly demonstrate the high effectiveness of our proposed model in predicting city-wide litter, surpassing multiple comparative models.

DE Point cloud; Voxel; Dual -scale; Feature fusion; Shape completion
AB For many vision tasks and intelligent robotics applications, it is common that the scanned 3D point cloud is not complete, so inferring from the residual defect shape to the intact shape becomes an essential task. Previous 3D completion neural network models generally use voxel-based or point-based methods to learn and process 3D data. For the voxel-based models, the computational cost and memory increase exponentially with the improvement of input resolution, and fine-grained features cannot be guaranteed in the completed point cloud due to limited computational resources. Point-based models suffer from the lack of precision in feature acquisition and crude reconstruction of complicated structures, making it extremely hard to accomplish elaborated semantic shapes. Combining advantages of voxel-based and point-based feature extraction through the highfrequency feature fusion module, this paper proposes a dual-scale point cloud completion network called DSNet, which performs global feature analysis at the voxel scale, and local feature analysis at the point cloud scale. The fused features are then integrated into the decoding and generation process, so as to complete the point cloud completion task from coarse to fine. Experimental results, at both quantitative and qualitative perspectives, in several prevailing datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art point cloud completion networks and has a good generalization performance. Code is available at https://github.com/ engqing/DSNet.

AB Learning from demonstration (LfD) has been widely studied as a convenient method for robot learning. In the LfD paradigm, the robot is required to learn relevant motion patterns from human demonstrations and apply them to various situations. Many advancements have been achieved in recent studies, however, there is a lack of studies on solutions for robots to learn the variability from demonstrations and adapt the reproduction to unseen scenarios in high-dimensional or long-trajectory cases. In this paper, a novel nonparametric kernelized gradient descent (KGD) method of LfD is proposed, which capitalizes on gradient descent and kernel-based approaches and produces a model with fewer open parameters than methods that employ basis functions. The proposed KGD method can accurately represent the complex demonstrations and utilize the variability of the demonstrations to adapt the trajectories smoothly to different unseen situations described by newly desired start-, via-and end-points precisely with high computational efficiency. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed KGD method and compare it with commonly used probabilistic kernelized movement primitive (KMP) and mean-prior Gaussian process regression (MP-GPR) methods. The results indicated that the proposed KGD method performs better than KMP and MP-GPR in terms of the precision of the desired points, reproduction smoothness, and computation time. On account of the high efficiency and outstanding reproduction, KGD has the potential to be beneficial for better human-robot collaboration, facilitating assembly lines or improving robot learning. An important future challenge will be to extend the KGD towards considering the nonlinear constraints to learn more complex tasks.

AB As a powerful tool, the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion has aroused extensive attention within the field of adaptive filtering recently. However, most MEE-based methods cannot be applied to the complex domain. Although the maximum total complex correntropy (MTCC) algorithm has been applied in errors-in-variables (EIV) model successfully when the noise is impulsive, it would degenerate obviously in some non-Gaussian noise cases, especially in the multi-peak distributed noise case. In this paper, we take the EIV model and complex domain into consideration and then propose a minimum total complex error entropy (MTCEE) algorithm. More importantly, the local stability and steady-state behavior of MTCEE are analyzed theoretically. Finally, we apply the MTCEE algorithm to the system identification and channel estimation, considering situations where noise affects both input and output. Through these applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of MTCEE under EIV model in complex domain.

DE Anomaly detection and segmentation; Convolutional neural network; Pseudo
   anomaly insertion; Superpixel segmentation
AB Existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based anomaly detection and segmentation approaches are overly sensitive or not sensitive enough to noise, resulting in anomaly patterns, partially detected in the testing stage. The previous methods may also differentiate normal and abnormal images, but they cannot identify the location of anomaly presented in test images with high accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage CNN model for coarse-to-fine anomaly segmentation and detection called (TASAD). In both stages of TASAD, we train our model on a mixture of normal and abnormal training samples. The abnormal images are obtained by inserting pseudo-anomaly patterns that are automatically generated from anomaly source images. We use a novel and sophisticated anomaly insertion technique to generate various anomalous samples. In the first stage, we design a coarse anomaly segmentation (CAS) model that takes a whole image as an input, while in the second stage, we train a fine anomaly segmentation (FAS) model on image patches. FAS model improves detection and segmentation performance by refining anomaly patterns partially detected by CAS model. We train our framework on MVTec dataset and compare it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The proposed architecture leads to a compact model size - four times smaller than the SOTA method, while exhibiting better pixel-level accuracy. TASAD can also be applied to SOTAs to further improve their anomaly detection performance. Our experiments demonstrate that when applied to the latest SOTAs, TASAD improves the average precision (AP) performance of previous methods by 6.2%. For reproducibility of the results, code is provided at https://github.com/Riz wanAliQau/tasad.git.

AB Encoding methods are employed across several process mining tasks, including predictive process monitoring, anomalous case detection, trace clustering, etc. These methods are usually performed as preprocessing steps and are responsible for mapping complex event data information into a numerical feature space. Most papers choose existing encoding methods arbitrarily or employ a strategy based on expert domain knowledge. Moreover, existing methods are employed by using their default parameters without evaluating other options. This practice can lead to several drawbacks, such as suboptimal performance and unfair comparisons with the state-of-the-art. Therefore, this work aims at providing a comprehensive survey and benchmark on event log encoding by comparing 27 methods, from different natures, in terms of expressivity, scalability, correlation, and domain agnosticism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study so far focusing on trace encoding in process mining. It contributes to maturing awareness about the role of trace encoding in process mining pipelines and sheds light on issues, concerns, and future research directions regarding the use of encoding methods to bridge the gap between machine learning models and process mining.

AB Partial fingerprint identification systems recognise an individual when the sensor size has a small form factor in accepting a full fingerprint. However, the distinctive features within a partial fingerprint are significantly less. Hence, the uniqueness of a partial fingerprint cannot be assured, leading to the possibility of identifying multiple users. A MasterPrint is a partial fingerprint identifying at least 4% distinct individuals in a partial fingerprint identification system. This work addresses the MasterPrint vulnerability by proposing a novel partial fingerprint identification scheme that extracts minutiae-oriented local features from binarized and thinned partial fingerprint images over eight axes emerging from a reference minutia. It also introduces a metric to compute the similarity score between two partial fingerprint templates. The results are compared with the baseline minutiae matching (BMM) method, a modified Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) based approach, VeriFinger 12.1 SDK, standard NIST NBIS, and Ridge Shape Feature (RSF) scheme. The experiments employing partial fingerprint datasets cropped from standard FVC2002 DB1_A, FVC2002 DB2_A, NIST Special Databases (sd302b and sd302d), and CrossMatch VeriFinger dataset have demonstrated that the proposed method generates the lowest MasterPrints with the highest identification accuracy.

ID PREDICTION
AB The stock market is a platform that allows individuals and organizations to buy stocks of publicly listed companies. It is imperative for investors and traders to utilize the platform to buy and sell stocks efficiently, but they must also determine when to do it in order to maximize profits. As trading involves holding stocks for shorter periods, projecting the future direction of a stock's price becomes essential. In recent years, deep neural network-based trading strategies have been researched and implemented to identify when a stock's price will increase or decrease. The main issues in implementing such solutions are that they need to deal with the noisy nature of the stock market and the problem of overfitting. The objective of the paper is to put forth an approach that utilizes deep learning techniques to predict price movements in the Nifty 50 index. The paper will explore the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for the given task. The paper will also look into applying metaheuristic algorithms to further improve the results of the prediction models. In this approach, RNNs, including Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), are utilized to predict the movement of the index. The models are trained on a unique and efficient feature set that takes into consideration the stock price of large market capitalization companies present in the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Our findings show that ensembled architectures produce better results than individual models. An LSTM and GRU ensembled architecture produced an accuracy of 56.66% and a precision of 0.4734. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was put forth as a method to hypertune the models to improve their performance. The LSTM, hypertuned with PSO, produced an accuracy of 57.64% and a precision of 0.2882. To further enhance the model's stock price prediction performance, the LSTM and GRU ensembled architecture was ensembled with the PSO hypertuned LSTM architecture to produce a model that gives the highest accuracy of 57.72%. The proposed ensemble approach outperforms the other cutting edge techniques used to forecast how the stock price of the NSE will move. Additionally, the ensemble method increased precision from 0.2882 to 0.5485, demonstrating that ensembling and the PSO algorithm combine to produce models with superior performance. Based on the results, combining PSO hyper parameter optimized models with ensembling provides a good approach towards price movement predictions and also shows the potential of using this approach in other Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields to improve the performance of deep learning models.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Modern industrial facilities generate large volumes of raw sensor data during the production process. This data is used to monitor and control the processes and can be analyzed to detect and predict process abnormalities. Typically, the data has to be annotated by experts in order to be used in predictive modeling. However, manual annotation of large amounts of data can be difficult in industrial settings.In this paper, we propose SensorSCAN, a novel method for unsupervised fault detection and diagnosis, designed for industrial chemical process monitoring. We demonstrate our model's performance on two publicly available datasets of the Tennessee Eastman Process with various faults. The results show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches (+0.2-0.3 TPR for a fixed FPR) and effectively detects most of the process faults without expert annotation. Moreover, we show that the model fine-tuned on a small fraction of labeled data nearly reaches the performance of a SOTA model trained on the full dataset. We also demonstrate that our method is suitable for real-world applications where the number of faults is not known in advance.

AB Semiconductor materials play a crucial role in the development of optoelectronics and power devices. However, their evaluation and selection pose a multi-attribute decision-making problem. This problem encompasses various considerations, such as multiple evaluation criteria, data variation, and the importance of criteria multiplicity. Therefore, this study proposes an integrated fuzzy multi-measurement decision-making model (IFMMDMM) to evaluate and select optimization techniques for semi-polar III-V semiconductor materials. The research methodology is designed based on three sequential phases. Firstly, four optimization techniques for semi-polar III-V semiconductor materials and four evaluation criteria are identified to construct the evaluation decision matrix. Secondly, the fuzzy-weighted zero-inconsistency method is developed to evaluate and assign weights to the defined multi-measurement criteria. Thirdly, the fuzzy decision by opinion score method is developed to select the optimization techniques for semi-polar III-V semiconductor materials. The weighting results reveal that the highest weight value was assigned to 'root mean square under surface morphology' (0.1382), while 'peak-to-valley under surface morphology' received the lowest weight value (0.1074). The selection results indicated that 'different flux with fixed cycle NH3 treatment (D)' ranked first, whereas 'NH3 flux at changing V/III (A)' had the lowest performance order. Systematic and sensitivity ranking assessments were performed to verify the efficiency of the proposed model.

AB In the context of urgent requirements for efficient metaheuristics, the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is tailored for tackling sophisticated optimization problems and has gained extensive momentum since its emergence. By drawing inspiration from the living habits of whales involving bubble-net attacking, encircling prey and discovering prey, WOA seems powerful to handle challenging problems owing to its unique mechanism. Nevertheless, in this work, through comparative experiments on several standard benchmarks and their shifted versions, we discuss the design flaws of WOA and exhibit the related cause analysis. Furthermore, we employ a useful validation method to test the deficiencies of WOA. Simulation outcomes suggest that WOA integrates a center-bias operator, which makes the algorithm shift-variant and limits its performances to tackle shifted benchmarks.

AB This article presents a deterministic reinforcement learning based optimized formation control for virtually -coupled trains using a novel designed performance index monitor, forming a new paradigm of artificial intelligence-based control for virtually-coupled trains. First, a reinforcement learning-based optimized forma-tion control is designed using backstepping design and neural networks-based actor-critic framework, achieving steady formation separation among multiple trains and providing key theoretical basis to "moving block with soft wall" (or virtually-coupled) mode, by online approximating the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations in both virtual position adjusting and actual speed regulating control signals. Second, a hysteretic -lag performance index monitor is designed to determine the time moments that enough knowledge has been obtained and insufficient knowledge is available in dynamical environments and switch the previously -mentioned reinforcement learning-based optimized formation control to deterministic reinforcement learning manner and vice versa. The idea of deterministic reinforcement learning lies in that as long as the convergences of actor and critic neural networks are observed, speaking equivalently, sufficient knowledge has been obtained provisionally, inner weight vectors of neural networks can be set as deterministic constant ones, achieving the human-like learning and control and reducing the computational amount. Rigorous closed-loop stability using deterministic reinforcement learning is also given using Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, by utilizing the designed performance index monitor, the switching behavior between reinforcement learning and deterministic reinforcement learning is guaranteed to be finite during finite time of running duration. Simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of proposed control.

AB Identifying the abnormal samples from a data set and determining their type are two key tasks of anomaly detection. However, the existing anomaly detection algorithms are generally faced with the defects of weak generalization ability and insufficient interpretation, the core reason of which is that they cannot mine specific features for different abnormal types. In this paper, a new anomaly detection algorithm aiming at feature selection for different abnormal types is developed. Inspired by self-supervised learning, we take the stationarity of variance changes of abnormal score similarity as a pretext task and combine it with wrapped search method. Then, the features and the corresponding parameters for different abnormal types can be screened to apply to the downstream task of anomaly integration detection. To verify the efficiency of the new algorithm, we conduct two sets of experiments to compare the new algorithm with 11 classical anomaly detection and 3 clustering anomaly detection algorithms on the data sets WDBC, WPBC and Wilt from DAMI database with the evaluation measures P@n, Adj-P@n, AP, Adj-AP and AUC. The experiment results show that, both in the identification and classification on abnormal samples, all performance measures of the new algorithm are explicitly better than that of the contrastive algorithms. Also, we apply the new algorithm to the Chinese auto insurance market, and find that the results can help managers to identify the main patterns of fraudulent claims and to summarize the feature combinations of fraud behaviors. In general, the new algorithm developed in this paper has the following advantages compared with traditional algorithms: 1) It can directly capture abnormal features and realize effective recognition of abnormal types, which effectively bridge the gap between abnormal judgement and feature screening. 2) Automatic screening of abnormal features can be completed under the condition of self-updating learning optimal strategy. 3) Only a few features are extracted from all features to reveal the abnormal characteristics, which significantly improves the interpretability and generalization ability of the algorithm and its results. In a word, through the novel self-supervised design method, feature screening is skillfully integrated into the anomaly detection task, which may provide a new way for anomaly detection research.

TI Ensemble clustering via fusing global and local structure information

ID ROBUST
AB Ensemble clustering is aimed at obtaining a robust consensus result from a set of weak base clusterings. Most existing methods rely on a co-association (CA) matrix that describes the frequency at which pairs of samples are clustered into the same class and exhibits a symmetrical property. However, these methods typically focus on either the global or local structure of the CA matrix and do not consider using both types of information simultaneously to improve ensemble clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel scheme to Fuse both the global Structure and the local structure information for Ensemble Clustering, namely FSEC, in this paper. Specifically, FSEC integrates both global structural information and local structural information into a learning framework by self-expressive and CA matrix self-enhancement models respectively. Moreover, FSEC embeds a Hadamard product fusion term to maximize the commonalities between global structure and local structure. The objective function optimization problem is solved by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FSEC outperforms many state-of-the-art methods of ensemble clustering.

TI ActionMixer: Temporal action detection with Optimal Action Segment

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DT Article
DE Temporal action detection; Dynamic label assignment; Optimal transport
AB In this paper, we propose a novel method for dynamic label assignment in temporal action detection (TAD) called Optimal Action Segment Assignment (OASA). The OASA method converts label assignment into an optimal transportation problem by computing the cost matrix between predicted temporal action segments and groundtruths. The unit transportation cost between a predicted temporal segment and a groundtruth pair is defined as the weighted summation of action classification loss and temporal localization loss. Additionally, we deploy Adaptive Estimation of Candidate Segment Number (AE-CSN) to adaptively determine the number of positive samples for each groundtruth. After formulation, the label assignment problem is converted to find a global optimal assignment plan by minimizing the cost. Therefore, OASA eliminates the need for manually designed prior parameters, which exist in fixed label assignment methods, and improves the generalization of the algorithm between different datasets. To evaluate OASA, we also introduce a simple anchor-free temporal action detector called ActionMixer. It consists of two components: Temporal Mixer and Channel Mixer. The Temporal Mixer employs depth-wise convolution layers with large kernels to capture temporal information, while the Channel Mixer mixes and extracts features across the channel dimension. Extensive experiments conducted on the THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and EPIC-Kitchens-100 datasets show that ActionMixer equipped with OASA achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing other advanced temporal action detection methods.

AB Training deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presents challenges in terms of memory requirements and computational resources, often resulting in issues such as model overfitting and lack of generalization. These challenges can only be mitigated by using an excessive number of training images. However, medical image datasets commonly suffer from data scarcity due to the complexities involved in their acquisition, preparation, and curation. To address this issue, we propose a compact and hybrid machine learning architecture based on the Morphological and Convolutional Neural Network (MCNN), followed by a Random Forest classifier. Unlike deep CNN architectures, the MCNN was specifically designed to achieve effective performance with medical image datasets limited to a few hundred samples. It incorporates various morphological operations into a single layer and uses independent neural networks to extract information from each signal channel. The final classification is obtained by utilizing a Random Forest classifier on the outputs of the last neural network layer. We compare the classification performance of our proposed method with three popular deep CNN architectures (ResNet-18, ShuffleNet-V2, and MobileNet-V2) using two training approaches: full training and transfer learning. The evaluation was conducted on two distinct medical image datasets: the ISIC dataset for melanoma classification and the ORIGA dataset for glaucoma classification. Results demonstrate that the MCNN method exhibits reliable performance in melanoma classification, achieving an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.97), outperforming the popular CNN architectures. For the glaucoma dataset, the MCNN achieved an AUC of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.74), which was similar to the performance of the popular CNN architectures. This study contributes to the understanding of mathematical morphology in shallow neural networks for medical image classification and highlights the potential of hybrid architectures in effectively learning from medical image datasets that are limited by a small number of case samples.

   numerical linear algebra; signal processing
AB The matrix-based Renyi's entropy (MBRE) has recently been introduced as a substitute for the original Renyi's entropy that could be directly obtained from data samples, avoiding the expensive intermediate step of density estimation. Despite its remarkable success in a broad of information-related tasks, the computational cost of MBRE, however, becomes a bottleneck for large-scale applications. The challenge, when facing sequential data, is further amplified due to the requirement of large-scale eigenvalue decomposition on multiple dense kernel matrices constructed by sliding windows in the region of interest, resulting in O(mn(3)) overall time complexity, where m and n denote the number and the size of windows, respectively. To overcome this issue, we adopt the static MBRE estimator together with a variance reduction criterion to develop randomized approximations for the target entropy, leading to high accuracy with substantially lower query complexity by utilizing the historical estimation results. Specifically, assuming that the changes of adjacent sliding windows are bounded by beta << 1, which is a trivial case in domains, e.g., time-series analysis, we lower the complexity by a factor of root beta. Polynomial approximation techniques are further adopted to support arbitrary alpha orders. In general, our algorithms achieve O(mn(2) root beta st) total computational complexity, where s, t << n denote the number of vector queries and the polynomial degrees, respectively. Theoretical upper and lower bounds are established in terms of the convergence rate for both s and t, and large-scale experiments on both simulation and real-world data are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms. The results show that our methods achieve promising speedup with only a trivial loss in performance.

AB In recent years, deep learning models have shown their advantages in neuroimage analysis, such as brain disease diagnosis. Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to acquire numerous brain networks at a single centralized site to effectively train a high-quality deep learning model. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has gained popularity in brain disease diagnosis, which allows deep learning models to be trained without centralizing data. However, most FL-based works might still face two following challenges. Firstly, the high -dimensional features of brain networks are often far larger than sample size, which might lead to poor performance due to the curse of dimensionality. Secondly, differences in data distributions across different sites can impact the communication efficiency and performance of FL models. To overcome these challenges, we design a novel FL framework for diagnosing brain disorders, named FedBrain. Firstly, FedBrain proposes data augmentation based on L1 regularization to select significant features shared by all clients. The domain alignment loss based on the maximum mean discrepancy criterion is introduced to minimize differences in the marginal and conditional distributions between local clients. Furthermore, FedBrain proposes a personalized predictor based on mixture of experts to adapt to different clients, using a global and private predictor as two experts. Eventually, FedBrain integrates the above modules with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption into a unified FL framework. Experimental results on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness, which shows that FedBrain can reduce the communication burden of FL and achieve the highest average accuracy of 79% against other counterparts.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Accurate class and attribute recognition is the critical technique to convert the unstructured product image data into structured knowledge base, which provides strong support for product design in the future. However, objects of different classes sharing similar attribute may vary a lot in visual appearances, making it challenging to accurately recognize the objects and their attributes. Different from the traditional multi-label image recognition, the attribute of the object, as high-level semantic information, is not corresponding to certain regions of the object and requires to learn more fine-grained features to represent the latent high level semantic information for the attribute across different object categories. Therefore, a self-supervised method called Deconstruction and Reconstruction Learning Network (DRLN) is proposed to solve the above problems in this paper. The DRLN tries to learn more fine-grained and local feature of the input product image by a self-supervised task, which deconstructs the input product images by randomly shuffling their local regions and further reconstructs the features of corresponding deconstructed images. Besides, the proposed model is optimized in an end-to-end manner by learning from multiple tasks, i.e., the multi-label classification task, the adversarial discrimination task, and the location alignment task. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts for multi-label learning problems on both our product image dataset and another public available attribute recognition dataset. To facilitate future research in this field, all the datasets and codes are directly available online.1

AB Compared with 2D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 3D MRI is more powerful for generating high resolution images and visualizing small anatomical structures. However, 3D MRI acquisition is much more time-consuming due to the significantly larger number of phase encoding steps, which is directly proportional to the acquisition time. This paper proposes to select a volume-adaptive small subset of phases to accelerate 3D MRI scans and accurately reconstruct 3D images from the corresponding undersampled 3D k-space data. To avoid the delays caused by computationally expensive yet high-performance volume-adaptive phase selection, we propose a strategy of selecting multiple phases based on sampled slices from the volume during idle time within the repetition time (TR). To enhance the performance of phase selection, we propose a novel three -directional cross-attention phase selection network. Additionally, to improve the reconstruction performance, we introduce a three-directional slice-wise volume reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method, which we called EVOLVE (learning volume-adaptive phases), is the first work that learns volume -adaptive phases for fast 3D MRI. The extensive experimental results on a large-scale 3D MRI dataset at various acceleration factors demonstrate the substantial performance improvement in terms of image reconstruction achieved by using the EVOLVE method for phase selection compared to traditional learning free 3D MRI phase selection methods.

TI MCNet: Magnitude consistency network for domain adaptive object

AB Deep learning-based object detection methods have achieved promising results in normal scenarios, while such methods often fail to locate objects from the disturbed images captured in inclement environments. Most existing methods utilized denoise modules to assist the detection network or exploit prior knowledge to reduce the environment interference remaining in the features, which ignores the essential role of the frequency element. From a novel perspective, we observe that the inclement environment alters the frequency content in the features, which in turn crushes the detection. To tickle this problem, we present the Magnitude Consistency Network (MCNet) to distill the irrelevant contents in the frequency domain. The MCNet is composed of the detection network and the magnitude corrector. The detection network is able to locate and classify objects. However, in inclement environments, the crucial information about the objects of interest is disrupted by the nuisance noise introduced from the inclement environments. The magnitude corrector can recover relevant information about the objects in the frequency domain by distilling the irrelevant factors and refining the affected features. Alternately optimizing the magnitude corrector and the detection network gradually makes the frequency content between the disturbed image and the clear image to be consistent. By distilling the irrelevant noise in the feature, the detection network can learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed method is effective and outperforms existing methods by a clear margin on four datasets.

AB Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is a challenging task aiming to locate the "indistinguishable"object with high similarity to the background. Existing COD methods are highly dependent on the differences in extrinsic appearances while neglecting inherent physical characteristics. In this letter, we introduce polarization information to enlarge the discrepancies between objects and their surroundings for the COD task. We construct a polarization-based dataset PCOD that comprises 639 challenging real-world scenes, along with a CNN-based network PolarNet tailored to process polarization images. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on PCOD and other COD datasets, and shows enhanced qualitative and quantitative effectiveness compared with existing COD methods.

ID MASS SEGMENTATION; U-NET
AB Amidst of all the tumors, breast tumor is the main source for a high incidence mortality rate among women. In the past decades, this mortality rate has tremendously reduced by early detection and diagnosis of the tumors using different modalities. Mammograms have significantly contributed towards the detection of masses and calcifications which assists radiologists in decision making. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, several breast mass segmentation methods are devised to assists radiologists in detection of tumor masses and lesions. UNet and its variants are widely used deep learning techniques for mass segmentation in mammograms. Although, UNet exhibits an outstanding performance, it has certain limitations, where the extraction of the fine-grained features is still resilient. In this paper, a AU2Net is proposed where two UNets are cascaded and are connected through skip connections. The attention mechanism and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) are introduced to learn more contextual based features for an enhanced tumor segmentation. The proposed model is validated on Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM). The images are preprocessed and are augmented using conventional and deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network based approaches. The proposed method achieved a 92.3% dice score and 89.6% Intersection over Union (IoU) on CBIS-DDSM dataset.

ID IMAGE SUPERRESOLUTION; CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORK
AB In this paper, we aim to improve the imaging quality of super-resolution (SR) without increasing the inference time to address the difficulty of trading off between quality and inference time in many existing methods and design a deployment-friendly, lightweight model for mobile devices. Specifically, we propose a general RepDFSR framework to enhance the textures of SR images while avoiding additional inference time overhead, which can be applied to existing SR networks. It incorporates innovative convolutional block design, loss function design, and the re-parameterizable technique. In RepDFSR, we propose a re-parameterizable texture-enhanced convolution based on differential filters. It extracts texture information more advantageous and efficient in training than regular convolution. Secondly, we propose a DF loss function to compel the model to super-resolve the gradient mappings with high variance, thus reconstructing images with sharper textures. Moreover, we propose a TELNet network for mobile devices based on the RepDFSR framework to validate the effectiveness of RepDFSR and our thoughts on practical applications of SR on mobile devices. The experimental results demonstrate the successful integration of the RepDFSR framework with the existing SR methods. Additionally, the TELNet meets the requirements of mobile devices for hardware and quantization limitations, showcasing superior SR performance compared to classic and state-of-the-art methods.

AB Artificial neural networks are widely used for solving engineering design problems of various disciplines due to its simplicity, efficiency, and adaptability. It predicts promising and accurate results. Artificial neural network solves these problems with weights and biases obtained in the training process. In training, the weights and biases have to be updated such that the difference between predicted and actual values has to be minimized. The artificial neural network uses stochastic gradient steepest descent methods to update the weights and biases for optimizing it. These methods are good at finding the optimum solution. However, they suffer from the drawbacks of vanishing gradient at local minima and critical points and are sensitive to initial weights and biases. As a result, it falls into local minima, the training time becomes high, and accuracy becomes low. One of the best solutions to overcome these problems is to use metaheuristics algorithms instead of stochastic gradient descent methods. Among metaheuristics, the cuckoo search algorithm is widely used in many applications due to its simplicity and efficiency. In this work, we proposed an improved Cuckoo search algorithm by incorporating Voronoi diagram with Cuckoo search to strengthen the weak areas of Cuckoo search and to overcome the addressed problems of the artificial neural network. The proposed Cuckoo search algorithm performance is tested on higher dimensional benchmark functions and on benchmark data sets. Moreover, its performance is compared with variants of Cuckoo search and other metaheuristic algorithms. The proposed algorithm has shown better results in terms of the number of generations, accuracy, cross-entropy, and root mean square error (RMSE).

AB Learning-based robot grasping of deformable objects without force sensors is a challenging task. This paper proposes a method without force sensors to predict deformation properties and the grasp poses of objects to solve the problem of deformable objects damaged by the gripper. Firstly, the deformation representation of the object is defined according to the deformation ratio of the object grasped. Then, the lightweight dataset with object deformation properties is produced based on the truncated signed distance function technique. The dataset can render images from any perspective for the training network. Subsequently, we investigate the synergies between grasp pose and gripper closure and use the above lightweight dataset to train deep network. The resulting network, Def-Grasp, can predict object grasp poses and deformation properties, the gripper closure is calculated using the network predictions. Finally, the expected experimental results show that the deformable objects in the cluttered scene are not damaged by the gripper during the 6DoF grasping process.

AB As a crucial energy storage for the spacecraft power system, lithium-ion batteries degradation mechanisms are complex and involved with external environmental perturbations. Hence, effective remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and model reliability assessment confronts considerable obstacles. This article develops a new RUL prediction method for spacecraft lithium-ion batteries, where a hybrid data preprocessing-based deep learning model is proposed. First, to improve the correlation between battery capacity and features, the empirically selected high-dimensional features are linearized by using the Box-Cox transformation and then denoised via the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) method. Second, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is employed to perform feature dimensionality reduction, and the output of PCA is further processed by the sliding window technique. Third, a multiscale hierarchical attention bi-directional long short-term memory (MHA-BiLSTM) model is constructed to estimate the capacity in future cycles. Specifically, the MHA-BiLSTM model can predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries by considering the correlation and significance of each cycle's information during the degradation process on different scales. Finally, the proposed method is validated based on multiple types of experiments under two lithium-ion battery datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of feature extraction and multidimensional time series prediction.

AB Sleep apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders in the world. It is a common problem for patients to suffer from sleep disturbances. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) signal from a smart sensor. This is the reason why we called ZleepNet a network for sleep apnea detection. The proposed model includes three convolutional layers, which include ReLu activation function, 2 dense layers, and one dropout layer for predicting sleep apnea. In this proposed model, the use of signals for detecting the sleep apnea can be reduced from 25 sensors to 1 sensor. We conducted experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN using real patient data and compared them with traditional machine learning methods such as least discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM), baggy representation tree, and artificial neural network (ANN) on publicly available sleep datasets using the same parameter setting. The results show that the proposed model outperformed the other methods with the accuracy of 91.30% with the split rate of 0.2% in which the training data are 20% and testing data are 80%. The accuracy of the proposed CNN is 90.33% when compared with the LDA which achieved 86.5% accuracy with the split rate of 0.5% in which training data are 50% and testing data are 50%. It achieved 91.56% accuracy when compared with the support vector machine (SVM) in which training data are 70% and testing data are 30%. The achieved accuracy of the proposed CNN is 91.89% when compared with bagging representation tree in which training data are 90% and testing data are 10%. The accuracy of the proposed CNN is 91.30% in which training data are 83% and testing data are 17% when compared with artificial neural networks (ANN).

AB Axiomatization is a significant and challenging task in the field of fuzzy variable precision rough sets, where research is currently limited. This paper aims to address this gap by defining and characterizing 14 types of L-fuzzy variable precision rough sets (LFVPRS for short). First, we introduce three fundamental LFVPRSs generated by Euclidean, mediate, and associate L-fuzzy relations. Second, we present their single axiomatic characterizations using the product of L-fuzzy sets. Lastly, we provide single axiomatic characterizations for another 11 types of LFVPRSs, which are generated by various compositions of reflexive, transitive, symmetry, Euclidean, mediate, and associate L-fuzzy relations. These single axiomatic characterizations are entirely innovative and have not been explored, even in the context of classical rough sets and fuzzy rough sets.

AB Communication and information technologies shape the world's systems of today, and those systems shape our society. The security of those systems relies on mathematical problems that are hard to solve for classical computers, that is, the available current computers. Recent advances in quantum computing threaten the security of our systems and the communications we use. In order to face this threat, multiple solutions and protocols have been proposed in the Post-Quantum Cryptography project carried on by the National Institute of Standards and Technologies. The presented work focuses on defining a formal framework in Maude for the security analysis of different postquantum key encapsulation mechanisms under assumptions given under the DolevYao model. Through the use of our framework, we construct a symbolic model to represent the behaviour of each of the participants of the protocol in a network. We then conduct reachability analysis and find a man-in-the-middle attack in each of them and a design vulnerability in Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation. For both cases, we provide some insights on possible solutions. Then, we use the Maude Linear Temporal Logic model checker to extend the analysis of the symbolic system regarding security, liveness and fairness properties. Liveness and fairness properties hold while the security property does not due to the man-in-the-middle attack and the design vulnerability in Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation.

AB Digital evolution is a branch of artificial life in which self-replicating computer programs-digital organisms-mutate and evolve within a user-defined computational environment. In spite of its value in biology, we still lack an up-to-date and comprehensive database on digital organisms resulting from evolution experiments. Therefore, we have developed an ontology-based semantic database-avidaDB-and an R package-avidaR-that provides users of the R programming language with an easy-to-use tool for performing complex queries without specific knowledge of SPARQL or RDF. avidaR can be used to do research on robustness, evolvability, complexity, phenotypic plasticity, gene regulatory networks, and genomic architecture by retrieving the genomes, phenotypes, and transcriptomes of more than a million digital organisms available on avidaDB. avidaR is already accepted on CRAN (i.e., a comprehensive collection of R packages contributed by the R community) and will make biologists better equipped to embrace the field of digital evolution.

DE Federated learning (FL); kernel support vector machine (SVM); memory

AB A federated learning (FL) scheme (denoted as Fed-KSVM) is designed to train kernel support vector machines (SVMs) over multiple edge devices with low memory consumption. To decompose the training process of kernel SVM, each edge device first constructs high-dimensional random feature vectors of its local data, and then trains a local SVM model over the random feature vectors. To reduce the memory consumption on each edge device, the optimization problem of the local model is divided into several subproblems. Each subproblem only optimizes a subset of the model parameters over a block of random feature vectors with a low dimension. To achieve the same optimal solution to the original optimization problem, an incremental learning algorithm called block boosting is designed to solve these subproblems sequentially. After training of the local models, the central server constructs a global SVM model by averaging the model parameters of these local models. Fed-KSVM only increases the iterations of training the local SVM models to save the memory consumption, while the communication rounds between the edge devices and the central server are not affected. Theoretical analysis shows that the kernel SVM model trained by Fed-KSVM converges to the optimal model with a linear convergence rate. Because of such a fast convergence rate, Fed-KSVM reduces the communication cost during training by up to 99% compared with the centralized training method. The experimental results also show that Fed-KSVM reduces the memory consumption on the edge devices by nearly 90% while achieving the highest test accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art schemes.

AB This article describes experiments on speech segmentation using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks. The main part of the paper deals with multi-lingual and cross-lingual segmentation, that is, it is performed on a language different from the one on which the model was trained. The experimental data involves large Czech, English, German, and Russian speech corpora designated for speech synthesis. For optimal multi-lingual modeling, a compact phonetic alphabet was proposed by sharing and clustering phones of particular languages. Many experiments were performed exploring various experimental conditions and data combinations. We proposed a simple procedure that iteratively adapts the inaccurate default model to the new voice/language. The segmentation accuracy was evaluated by comparison with reference segmentation created by a well-tuned hidden Markov model-based framework with additional manual corrections. The resulting segmentation was also employed in a unit selection text-to-speech system. The generated speech quality was compared with the reference segmentation by a preference listening test.

AB The large size tolerance and positional differences of burrs in cast iron blanks make it easy for traditional teaching polishing paths to cause overcutting or undercutting. Rapid and accurate identification of burrs and real-time correction of polishing trajectories are key technical issues for achieving high-precision polishing. Here, a deep learning-based method for defect detection in cast iron parts and surfaces is proposed. Firstly, a self-made dataset of cast iron parts and surface defects is created and annotated, and a variety of data augmentation methods are used to expand the number of samples in the original dataset, alleviating the problem of small sample size. Then, the coordinate attention mechanism is introduced into the backbone network to allocate more attention to the defect target. Finally, the bidirectional weighted feature pyramid network (BiFPN) is used in the feature fusion network to replace the original path aggregation network, improving the model's ability to fuse features of different sizes. Experimental results show that compared with the original model, the mean average precision (mAP) is increased by 3.1%, and the average precision (AP) in defect classification is increased by 7.6%, with an FPS of 112, achieving accurate and efficient real-time detection of cast iron parts and surface defects.
   First, this article used multiple data augmentation methods to alleviate the problem of small sample size in casting datasets. Second, attention mechanism was introduced. Finally, a novel feature fusion layer structure was adopted to improve the original network model. The experiment shows that compared with the original network model, the improved model proposed here has increased the accuracy of casting surface defect recognition category by 7.6%.image

AB This article proposes a new framework using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to simulate complex structural systems that consist of single and double beams based on Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko theories, where the double beams are connected with a Winkler foundation. In particular, forward and inverse problems for the Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko partial differential equations (PDEs) are solved using nondimensional equations with the physics-informed loss function. Higher order complex beam PDEs are efficiently solved for forward problems to compute the transverse displacements and cross-sectional rotations with less than 1e - 3% error. Furthermore, inverse problems are robustly solved to determine the unknown dimensionless model parameters and applied force in the entire space-time domain, even in the case of noisy data. The results suggest that PINNs are a promising strategy for solving problems in engineering structures and machines involving beam systems.

AB Viral marketing is a frequently used social marketing strategy which aims to promote products on various social media. In order to devise an efficient viral marketing strategy, influence maximization problem is widely studied in social networks. Influence maximization problem tries to find a set of influential users who could influence social users maximally. However, existed influence maximization algorithms could not satisfy the needs of social marketers well. In social networks, community structure is an important feature where social users are closely connected together in groups, and structural hole spanners are those users who bridge different communities. In order to balance the effectiveness and efficiency of viral marketing in social networks, in this paper, we present to exploit the community structure and structural hole spanners in social networks for solving the influence maximization problem. Different to traditional algorithms, we devise a strategy to approximate social influences of social users to find seeds efficiently. In particular, for an internal user inside a community in social networks, we utilize his social influence to members inside this community to approximate his social influence in the whole social network. For a structural hole spanner who bridges multiple communities, we utilize his social influence to members in these communities to approximate his social influence in the whole network. Based on the approximate social influence, information diffusion model and greedy framework, we propose a Community and Structural Hole Spanner based Greedy (CSHS-G) algorithm which devises several influence lists to store social influences of users and fast computation scheme to find seeds. Besides, to further improve the efficiency, we propose a Community and Structural Hole Spanner based Heuristic (CSHS-H) algorithm which approximates social influences of structural hole spanners by utilizing their 2-hops influences. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation on the crawled real-world data set. Experimental results show that, compared to all of the baseline algorithms, our proposed algorithms not only have high efficiency, but also could guarantee larger influence spread.

AB The lack of rich visual information affects the shopping experience of the visually impaired (VI), including identifying and selecting commodities. Recent studies on VI assistance have focused on commodity identification but neglected to provide fine-grained and intuitive pick-up guidance, which is not user-friendly enough. Therefore, we propose a user-driven shopping assistance system to improve the shopping experience for VI users. We first conduct an in-depth interview with VI, then implement a prototype shopping assistance system-MobiEye, with real-time video analysis. Further, we evaluate the prototype system and identify two directions to optimizing the existing system: (1) Improving the pick-up accuracy in dense placement; and (2) reducing the latency and communication overhead. To address these two problems, we design a new guidance strategy for dense placements and propose a mobile-edge cocomputing strategy with a motion predictor and a communication gate to filter the transmitted images. Finally, we invited VI participants to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MobiEye. The experimental results show that MobiEye achieved a 13% improvement in pick-up success rate and a 12 s reduction in average pick-up time compared with other shopping assistance systems.

TI Specifying Requirements for Modern Software Development: A Test-Oriented

DE Software requirements specification; distributed systems; software
   testing; quality requirements
AB Most modern computer systems operate in distributed environments. To develop and test such applications, services, and systems, it is necessary to consider the physical devices, architectures, communication, security and deployment mechanisms involved. However, the requirements' specification process still replicates that of traditional applications: details remain implicit and are hidden in the description. As a result, specifications are difficult to identify and, ultimately, tests are designed in the traditional way: they overlook constraints and fail to achieve the desired effects. Our objective is to design a methodology for specifying requirements in both traditional software and applications deployed in distributed environments. We present an iterative and incremental requirements specification methodology. This methodology allows us to describe functional requirements and incorporate non-functional or quality constraints, which is the main contribution of this proposal. To ensure that quality requirements are specified during the design phase, the methodology proposes a series of phases, stages and artefacts that ensure the discovery and consideration of these requirements. In order to find out the strengths and weaknesses of our methodology, we have carried out a comparative study with other similar proposals in the literature. To this end, evaluation criteria were defined by considering standards and good practices in Requirements Engineering. The results of the comparative study show that our methodology constitutes a solid procedure for a detailed requirements specification from the beginning of the software development cycle. This represents an advance over the rest of the proposals studied. Our methodology contributes to the simplification of the design and execution phases of software testing, enabling traceability between the specified requirements and the designed test cases.

AB This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture named OlapNet, which incorporates implicit operations of OLAP cubes (or data cubes). OLAP cubes are produced from database tables or spreadsheets and they allow particular operations that support performing complex queries efficiently. OlapNet permits evaluating various combinations of these OLAP operations in its search space and thus, it enables, in part, to automate the data transformation step in the knowledge discovery process. A sample of data from an actual database containing anonymized data on the debt history of customers of a financial institution has been used to evaluate our proposal. A predictive classification problem to estimate the probability of any given customer contracting new credits in the next three months has been modelled from these data. Then, traditional methods of Machine Learning and CNN were applied. The results showed that CNN, using the OlapNet architecture, outperforms traditional methods in almost all cases, indicating that the proposed architecture is quite promising.

AB Direct and fairly simple geometric criteria are proved to be necessary for the Perspective 3-Point (P3P) Problem to have a real solution point. This is so under the assumption that the three control points are at the vertices of an acute triangle. Collectively, these criteria appear to be sufficient as well, based on substantial experimental evidence. Proving the necessity of some of the criteria does not involve the acute triangle assumption, and so these are required for obtuse and right triangles as well. While motivated by the P3P Problem, the results are actually concerned with various constraints among six of the angles that occur in a tetrahedron. Therefore, the results likely have other applications.

AB Handwriting recognition has become an active area of research in pattern recognition and machine learning in recent years. Handwriting recognition systems have a variety of applications ranging from digital character conversion to signboard translation and scene image analysis. Extensive research work has been carried out for natural language processing of different scripts from all over the world, and the offline handwriting recognition of Indic scripts has also been drawing the major attention of pattern recognition researchers for the last two decades. The research for handwriting recognition has also gained further momentum because of planned funding by the Indian government towards technology development of Indian languages and scripts. These include work for Bangla, Devanagari, Gurmukhi, Tamil and Telugu, Gujarati, Kannada and other Indic scripts. In this study, we present an inclusive survey report of recent advances in Indic script offline handwriting recognition work, mainly focusing on the state-of-the-art work that appeared in the past 15 years, and it includes the following three related research areas in Indic scripts: (1) offline handwritten character recognition, (2) offline handwritten digit recognition and (3) offline handwritten word recognition. There is great work done for character and numeral handwriting recognition in Indic scripts, but the research for word and sentence handwriting recognition in Indic scripts is still an emerging research area. Finally, the present study is an important guide for future researchers, and there exists a great opportunity for further research in Indic script offline handwriting recognition.

AB Local model-agnostic additive explanation techniques decompose the predicted output of a black-box model into additive feature importance scores. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the produced local additive explanations. We investigate this by studying whether some of the most popular explanation techniques can accurately explain the decisions of linear additive models. We show that even though the explanations generated by these techniques are linear additives, they can fail to provide accurate explanations when explaining linear additive models. In the experiments, we measure the accuracy of additive explanations, as produced by, e.g., LIME and SHAP, along with the non-additive explanations of Local Permutation Importance (LPI) when explaining Linear and Logistic Regression and Gaussian naive Bayes models over 40 tabular datasets. We also investigate the degree to which different factors, such as the number of numerical or categorical or correlated features, the predictive performance of the black-box model, explanation sample size, similarity metric, and the pre-processing technique used on the dataset can directly affect the accuracy of local explanations.

AB The literature on adjective ordering abounds with proposals meant to account for why certain adjectives appear before others in multi-adjective strings (e.g., the small brown box). However, these proposals have been developed and tested primarily in isolation and based on English; few researchers have looked at the combined performance of multiple factors in the determination of adjective order, and few have evaluated predictors across multiple languages. The current work approaches both of these objectives by using technologies and datasets from natural language processing to look at the combined performance of existing proposals across 32 languages. Comparing this performance with both random and idealized baselines, we show that the literature on adjective ordering has made significant meaningful progress across its many decades, but there remains quite a gap yet to be explained.

TI Subspace Adaptation Prior for Few-Shot Learning
SO MACHINE LEARNING
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Meta-learning; Few-shot learning; Neural networks
AB Gradient-based meta-learning techniques aim to distill useful prior knowledge from a set of training tasks such that new tasks can be learned more efficiently with gradient descent. While these methods have achieved successes in various scenarios, they commonly adapt all parameters of trainable layers when learning new tasks. This neglects potentially more efficient learning strategies for a given task distribution and may be susceptible to overfitting, especially in few-shot learning where tasks must be learned from a limited number of examples. To address these issues, we propose Subspace Adaptation Prior (SAP), a novel gradient-based meta-learning algorithm that jointly learns good initialization parameters (prior knowledge) and layer-wise parameter subspaces in the form of operation subsets that should be adaptable. In this way, SAP can learn which operation subsets to adjust with gradient descent based on the underlying task distribution, simultaneously decreasing the risk of overfitting when learning new tasks. We demonstrate that this ability is helpful as SAP yields superior or competitive performance in few-shot image classification settings (gains between 0.1% and 3.9% in accuracy). Analysis of the learned subspaces demonstrates that low-dimensional operations often yield high activation strengths, indicating that they may be important for achieving good few-shot learning performance. For reproducibility purposes, we publish all our research code publicly.

ID FACE RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Nowadays, face recognition using video surveillance systems becomes one of the active research topics in security domains. Security plays a significant role in everyday life for secure and sustainable developments of smart cities. The conventional techniques provide efficient recognition results only when the faces are captured with complete face images. However, they suffer to handle large pose variation images extracted from video sequences. Therefore, to deal with this issue, this paper specially designed a multidimensional face recognition model to recognize faces under multiple pose variations and angles. Three face video databases, namely facesurv database, IARPA Janus benchmark database and McGill database, are utilized for experimental evaluation. The videos of these three databases are converted into number of image frames through background subtraction process. From the image frames, the large pose variation images with different angles are identified and selected to process further. The video recorded under dynamic environment conditions diminishes recognition performance, so the image frames are processed through several preprocessing pipelines. The preprocessed images are then fed into the proposed optimal mask region-based convolutional neural network with modified short-term memory (OMRCNN-MBiLSTM) model, which learns the facial patterns present in the images more efficiently. The feature vectors learned by the proposed classifier are matched with the input face database to determine the identity of the person. With the ability to handle multiview and large pose variations, the proposed model accurately recognizes faces. The simulation result manifests the superiority of proposed model over other existing methods.

AB Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, with millions of cases and deaths each year. Accurate diagnosis is critical for timely treatment and medication. Machine learning techniques have shown promising results in detecting breast cancer. Previous studies have primarily used single-modality data for breast cancer diagnosis. Hence, this work aims to mobilize the benefits of multimodal data over unimodality samples. This study proposes a custom deep learning-based model pipeline that works over this multimodal data. This work has been separated into three phases. Phase 1 and Phase 2 under the unimodal category examine gene expression data and histopathological images separately. The Cancer Genome Atlas makes these datasets available. In Phase 3, the proposed pipeline operates on both data types' samples for each patient in the multimodal category. This study investigates how data pre-processing (cleaning, transformation, reduction) and cascaded filtering affect model performance. Precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy assessed the models, whereas L2 regularization, exponentially weighted moving average, and transfer learning minimized over-fitting. A custom deep neural network and support vector machine obtained 86% accuracy in Phase 1, whereas the VGG16 model reached 80.21% accuracy in Phase 2. In Phase 3, the curated multimodal dataset was applied to a custom deep learning pipeline (VGG16 backbone with hyper-tuned machine learning models as head classifiers) to achieve 94% accuracy, demonstrating the importance of multimodal data over unimodal in breast cancer subtype classification. These findings highlight the importance of multimodal data for breast cancer diagnosis and subtype prediction.

AB The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides brand-new technical support and a broader resource platform for college oral English teaching and evaluation. The advancement of science, technology, and networks has resulted in significant educational changes. Because of these, the demand for English instruction is rising quickly, along with the level of cultural integration. However, due to the limits of conventional teaching techniques and the slow expansion of information technology, oral English classes have been discarded and discontinued for a long time. Based on the preceding, this paper first addresses the shortcomings of traditional college-level spoken English instruction by exposing content and timing deficiencies. It then describes how spoken English data are collected, preprocessed, and framed before being standardized for consistency. After that, this paper uses mapping recognition results using a DBN speech model and correlation coefficients in the evaluation. In addition, it uses the Pairwise Variability Index in rhythm evaluation to assess stress distribution differences between test and standard pronunciation. Besides the above, the proposed approach uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) optimization inside statistical learning to improve phoneme recognition and reliability, especially when dealing with difficult-to-distinguish phoneme sets. Further analysis is carried out using neural networks, which include excitation functions and error computations. Finally, the complete design emphasizes user-centric functional characteristics such as practicability, user needs, and robust system management subsystems. Experiments suggest that the natural language processing-based oral English teaching mode can increase students' overall oral English skills. These results reveal that students' excitement increased by 33.3%, their verbal fluency increased by 86%, and their vocabulary learning increased by 16.1%. The results show that this method can effectively assist students in learning oral English.

AB In this paper, a new hybrid method is developed that incorporates the rationale of truncated power basis (TPB) and artificial bee colony-back propagation neural networks (ABC-BPNN) into an adaptive fuzzy semi-parametric regression model yielding more accurate results and better generalization ability. The proposed adaptive fuzzy semi-parametric regression model comprises sub-model formulation and approximates the observed fuzzy outputs from the outside employing neural networks computation, such that the proposed adaptive fuzzy regression model better explains the inherent dependence and vagueness that exist in a given dataset. Using the cross-validation criterion and absolute deviation-based distance measures for LR-type fuzzy numbers, a target function optimization problem of constructing the adaptive fuzzy semi-parametric regression is performed by solving the smooth function, bandwidth of kernel function, and regression coefficients. This strategy significantly increases the goodness of fit for the proposed algorithm and offers a dependence framework among magnitude and uncertainty for the fuzzy regression model. We also use three formula measures to evaluate the fit quality of the regression results within each membership function as well as in the center or spread tendency property, respectively. The proposed algorithm is numerically evaluated on three experimental examples including a simulation study and two practical cases to prove its practicality and efficiency. Comparative analyses of our proposed method are provided to support its cogency, and the results show that our proposed model is more effective and stable than some other existing fuzzy regressions.

AB Skin disease recognition is one of the essential topics in the medical industry. Detecting skin disease from appearance can be difficult due to the similar appearance of skin lesions. In some cases, such as the monkeypox virus, the illness must be quickly determined, and the patients must be isolated to reduce the spreading of the disease. This study aims to create a deep learning-based automated intelligent mobile application to detect skin disease. First, different small-size pretrained networks are trained for skin lesion image classification. Then, the most suitable network from the viewpoint of both performance and mobile compatibility is transformed into the TensorFlow Lite format. Finally, a mobile application is created on the Android platform that utilizes the smartphone's camera to obtain images and uses TensorFlow Lite to make predictions. The proposed system produces 74.27% classification accuracy for seven classes on a combined dataset. It produces comparable/better results compared to the literature. Owing to the proposed system, the patients can make a preliminary diagnosis of their lesions using their smartphones. Thus, risky patients can be encouraged to visit the hospital for a definitive diagnosis. In addition, the mobile application can avoid undue stress and false alarms.
   Automated skin lesion analysis systems can assist people in ensuring rapid diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to realize these types of systems. Integrating CNNs into smartphones opens new doors for creating mobile intelligent systems. Mobile devices can be utilized to assist people in many different aspects, such as healthcare, with the help of machine learning.image & COPY; 2023 WILEY-VCH GmbH

DE Global re-localization; Sparse 3D LiDAR scans; Deep learning;
   Subterranean
AB Localization algorithms that rely on 3D LiDAR scanners often encounter temporary failures due to various factors, such as sensor faults, dust particles, or drifting. These failures can result in a misalignment between the robot's estimated pose and its actual position in the global map. To address this issue, the process of global re-localization becomes essential, as it involves accurately estimating the robot's current pose within the given map. In this article, we propose a novel global re-localization framework that addresses the limitations of current algorithms heavily reliant on scan matching and direct point cloud feature extraction. Unlike most methods, our framework eliminates the need for an initial guess and provides multiple top-k candidates for selection, enhancing robustness and flexibility. Furthermore, we introduce an event-based re-localization trigger module, enabling autonomous robotic missions. Focusing on subterranean environments with low features, we leverage range image descriptors derived from 3D LiDAR scans to preserve depth information. Our approach enhances a state-of-the-art data-driven descriptor extraction framework for place recognition and orientation regression by incorporating a junction detection module that utilizes the descriptors for classification purposes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated across three distinct real-life subterranean environments.

DE Recommender systems; Contrastive learning; Knowledge graphs;
   Non-Euclidean space
AB Contrastive learning has recently triggered a series of valuable studies in the recommendation field, as it can extract supervised information from large-scale unsupervised data, reducing interference from unrelated entities. However, in real scenarios, supervised data is often sparse and challenging to fully leverage, in-evitably leading to decreased accuracy in recommendation algorithms based on contrastive learning. Although knowledge graphs can offer abundant facts and serve as a rich source for supervised signals, achieving data augmentation effects, knowledge graph embedding heightens sensitivity to changes in graph node information. Moreover, the Euclidean space is not entirely suitable for accommodating varying degrees of graph structure expansion. To fill this research gap, we propose a mixed-curvature knowledge-enhanced graph contrastive learning for recommendation (MKGCL). Specifically, we design a knowledge-enhanced approach to generate knowledge-enhanced global views, which combines user-item interaction views with knowledge-augmented semantic views, resulting in more reliable and comprehensive regulatory signals. In particular, based on the characteristics of the curvature space, we construct multiple product manifolds of a single curvature space, thereby constructing a comprehensive mixed-curvature space, which ensures better scalability for the expansion of the graph structure. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, results show that MKGCL significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms in comparison.

AB In this study, we focus on sentence splitting, a subfield of text simplification, motivated largely by an unproven idea that if you divide a sentence in pieces, it should become easier to understand. Our primary goal in this study is to find out whether this is true. In particular, we ask, does it matter whether we break a sentence into two, three, or more? We report on our findings based on Amazon Mechanical Turk. More specifically, we introduce a Bayesian modeling framework to further investigate to what degree a particular way of splitting the complex sentence affects readability, along with a number of other parameters adopted from diverse perspectives, including clinical linguistics, and cognitive linguistics. The Bayesian modeling experiment provides clear evidence that bisecting the sentence leads to enhanced readability to a degree greater than when we create simplification with more splits.

AB A family of fuzzy multi-criteria sorting models, FTOPSIS-Sort, as a fuzzy extension of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) ordinary method TOPSIS, is introduced and analyzed. Models from this family differ by approaches to determining functions of fuzzy numbers (approximate computations, standard fuzzy arithmetic, and transformation method) and by methods for ranking of fuzzy numbers (two defuzzification based ranking methods are considered). The features of developing and adjusting Fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) models to sorting problematic are presented. The developed models are implemented in the case study on a healthcare supply chain alternative selection problem. For exploring distinctions in sorting alternatives by FTOPSIS-Sort models, the special algorithms have been developed along with their integrating with Monte Carlo simulation of a large number of input scenarios, each of which is a separate (and independent of the others) multicriteria problem on sorting alternatives. The results of such an analysis demonstrate a significant distinction in sorting alternatives by different FTOPSIS-Sort models. The latter has theoretical, methodological, and applied significance within the use of Fuzzy TOPSIS (Fuzzy MCDA) sorting models.

AB With the wide applications of underactuated robotic systems, more complex tasks and higher safety demands are put forward. However, it is still an open issue to utilize "fewer" control inputs to satisfy control accuracy and transient performance with theoretical and practical guarantee, especially for unactuated variables. To this end, for underactuated robotic systems, this article designs an adaptive tracking controller to realize exponential convergence results, rather than only asymptotic stability or boundedness; meanwhile, unactuated states exponentially converge to a small enough bound, which is adjustable by control gains. The maximum motion ranges and convergence speed of all variables both exhibit satisfactory performance with higher safety and efficiency. Here, a data-driven concurrent learning (CL) method is proposed to compensate for unknown dynamics/disturbances and improve the estimate accuracy of parameters/weights, without the need for persistency of excitation or linear parametrization (LP) conditions. Then, a disturbance judgment mechanism is utilized to eliminate the detrimental impacts of external disturbances. As far as we know, for general underactuated systems with uncertainties/disturbances, it is the first time to theoretically and practically ensure transient performance and exponential convergence speed for unactuated states, and simultaneously obtain the exponential tracking result of actuated motions. Both theoretical analysis and hardware experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of the designed controller.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB Symbolic regression is a machine learning technique that can learn the equations governing data and thus has the potential to transform scientific discovery. However, symbolic regression is still limited in the complexity and dimensionality of the systems that it can analyze. Deep learning, on the other hand, has transformed machine learning in its ability to analyze extremely complex and high-dimensional datasets. We propose a neural network architecture to extend symbolic regression to parametric systems where some coefficient may vary, but the structure of the underlying governing equation remains constant. We demonstrate our method on various analytic expressions and partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying coefficients and show that it extrapolates well outside of the training domain. The proposed neural-network-based architecture can also be enhanced by integrating with other deep learning architectures such that it can analyze high-dimensional data while being trained end-to-end. To this end, we demonstrate the scalability of our architecture by incorporating a convolutional encoder to analyze 1-D images of varying spring systems.

DE Knowledge transfer; Few-shot classification; Feature extractor
AB Few-shot learning aims at recognizing novel visual categories from very few labelled examples. Different from the existing few-shot classification methods that are mainly based on metric learning or meta-learning, in this work we focus on improving the representation capacity of feature extractors. For this purpose, we propose a new two-stage dual selective knowledge transfer (DSKT) framework, to guide models towards better optimization. Specifically, we first exploit an improved multi-task learning approach to train a feature extractor with robust representation capability as a teacher model. Then, we design an effective dual selective knowledge distillation method, which enables the student model to selectively learn knowledge from the teacher model and current samples, thereby improving the student model's ability to generalize on unseen classes. Extensive experimental results show that our DSKT achieves competitive performances on four well-known few-shot classification benchmarks.

AB Snake robot's low view angle makes them vulnerable to being blocked by obstacles, which causes visual loss and track offset. In this paper, a trajectory prediction method and visual localization system for snake robots based on a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network are proposed. First, the kinematics model of the snake robot is established by using the Denavit Hartenberg (DH) method, and the robot's control system is described in detail. Then, the trajectory prediction model based on a BiLSTM neural network is proposed, and the network training platform is introduced. Meanwhile, the BiLSTM network's model parameters for trajectory prediction are analyzed and optimized. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method, three other network prediction methods are compared. Furthermore, in order to solve the visual tracking loss of the snake robot, a novel trajectory prediction and visual localization systems based on a BiLSTM neural network and the Oriented Brief-Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (ORB-SLAM3) systems are designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; DIAGNOSIS; MACHINERY
AB Intelligent fault diagnosis plays an important role in machine health management. Fault data in real applications are usually imbalanced, which makes some categories unknown to the learner. Some recent approaches assign an unknown label to all these categories, which may not be sufficient for further remending operations. This paper proposes unknown fault category exploration through active query evidence model (UFAE), which effectively distinguishes unknown faults, and balances the query to various unknown sub-faults, thereby providing better fault identification. First, we introduce subjective logic to model data evidence, to effectively explore instances with unknown faults. Second, we propose an active query strategy to select unknown subfaults. This process is executed iteratively to explore as many unknown sub-faults as possible, and eventually produces a high quality learner. We conducted experiments on classic fault datasets, including bearing structured data and pumping unit image data. The experimental results showed that UFAE achieved effective unknown sub-fault identification and outperformed competitors in open fault identification. Additionally, UFAE was more robust to unknown faults.

AB Facing the two major challenges of just-in-time (JIT) and energy-saving in part-feeding system for mixed-model assembly lines in automotive industry, this paper focuses on optimizing the part-feeding process by investigating the autonomous guided vehicles (AGV) routing and scheduling problem. A hybrid feeding policy, called dual-distribution, is proposed, which considers the utilization of different types of AGVs in various part-feeding policies. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model with the objectives of simultaneously minimizing the line-side inventory and AGV energy consumption in the part-feeding system. To solve this problem, a Q-learning-based multi-objective quantum-inspired Archimedes optimization algorithm (QMQAOA) is developed with a customized encoding and decoding approach to solve the problem. Besides, the quantum rotation gate initialization mechanism, the Q-learning-based neighborhood search strategy, and the neighboring distance calculation are integrated into the algorithm to improve both solution quality and convergence rate. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of QMQAOA by comparing it with the Gurobi solver and other benchmark algorithms. The results demonstrate the superiority of QMQAOA, with performance superiority rates of 90/90, 77/90, and 90/90 achieved for degree of Pareto optimality (DPO), evenness of solutions (ES), and inverted generational distance (IGD) indicators, respectively. From managerial insights, the application of different types of AGVs in the part-feeding system is shown to enhance efficiency when compared to using a single type of AGV in several instances. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the automotive part-feeding system.

AB Although the fifth generation (5G) is crucial to the current Internet of Things (IoT), the increase of automated IoT systems and data-centric services that need thousands of microseconds of latency, terabytes of data every second, and more than 107 IoT connections per km2 would be beyond the capability of current 5G networks. In order to fulfil the requirements of future IoT networks, this research presents an intelligent clustering and routing approach for IoT networks (ICR-IoT) that minimizes energy consumption and server latency, which are crucial factors in ensuring quality of service to the end users. Load balancing and energy efficiency in IoT-edge computing systems are NP- hard problems. This paper presents a novel approach called ICR-IoT for intelligent clustering and routing in internet of things networks, with the goal of minimizing energy consumption and server latency to ensure quality of service for end users. The approach uses a metaheuristic called the Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to solve the NP-hard problems of load balancing and energy efficiency in IoT edge computing systems, and a dynamic routing approach to handle changing network conditions such as node energy. ICR-IoT presents novel parameters, packet uniformity (Pu) and Lifetime uniformity (Lu) of the data aggregators to improve the overall 6G IoT network performance. An experiment set is created to thoroughly assess the performance of the proposed work with various sensor node and gateway configurations. We have implemented our code in Python 3.10 on a 64-bit system having 8 GB RAM and 2.00 GHz processor. The proposed approach was tested and found to perform better than the BPSO approach, with improvements in lifetime and energy uniformity of the network. The lifetime and energy uniformity has been improved by 13.6% and 27.07%, respectively. In general, the ICR-IoT approach has the potential to enhance routing and clustering performance, as well as quality of service and network lifetime, in 6G-IoT networks.

AB This article presents a comprehensive evaluation of instance segmentation models with respect to real-world image corruptions as well as out-of-domain image collections, e.g., images captured by a different set-up than the training dataset. The out-of-domain image evaluation shows the generalization capability of models, an essential aspect of real-world applications, and an extensively studied topic of domain adaptation. These presented robustness and generalization evaluations are important when designing instance segmentation models for real-world applications and picking an off-the-shelf pretrained model to directly use for the task at hand. Specifically, this benchmark study includes state-of-the-art network architectures, network backbones, normalization layers, models trained starting from scratch versus pretrained networks, and the effect of multitask training on robustness and generalization. Through this study, we gain several insights. For example, we find that group normalization (GN) enhances the robustness of networks across corruptions where the image contents stay the same but corruptions are added on top. On the other hand, batch normalization (BN) improves the generalization of the models across different datasets where statistics of image features change. We also find that single-stage detectors do not generalize well to larger image resolutions than their training size. On the other hand, multistage detectors can easily be used on images of different sizes. We hope that our comprehensive study will motivate the development of more robust and reliable instance segmentation models.

AB Graph-based semisupervised learning can explore the graph topology information behind the samples, becoming one of the most attractive research areas in machine learning in recent years. Nevertheless, existing graph-based methods also suffer from two shortcomings. On the one hand, the existing methods generate graphs in the original high-dimensional space, which are easily disturbed by noisy and redundancy features, resulting in low-quality constructed graphs that cannot accurately portray the relationships between data. On the other hand, most of the existing models are based on the Gaussian assumption, which cannot capture the local submanifold structure information of the data, thus reducing the discriminativeness of the learned low-dimensional representations. This article proposes a semisupervised subspace learning with adaptive pairwise graph embedding (APGE), which first builds a k(1)-nearest neighbor graph on the labeled data to learn local discriminant embeddings for exploring the intrinsic structure of the non-Gaussian labeled data, i.e., the submanifold structure. Then, a k(2-)nearest neighbor graph is constructed on all samples and mapped to GE learning to adaptively explore the global structure of all samples. Clustering unlabeled data and its corresponding labeled neighbors into the same submanifold, sharing the same label information, improves embedded data's discriminative ability. And the adaptive neighborhood learning method is used to learn the graph structure in the continuously optimized subspace to ensure that the optimal graph matrix and projection matrix are finally learned, which has strong robustness. Meanwhile, the rank constraint is added to the Laplacian matrix of the similarity matrix of all samples so that the connected components in the obtained similarity matrix are precisely equal to the number of classes in the sample, which makes the structure of the graph clearer and the relationship between the near-neighbor sample points more explicit. Finally, multiple experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that the method performs well in exploring local structure and classification tasks.

AB This paper introduces a new variant of a metaheuristic algorithm based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), the Q-learning algorithm and the Exponential Monte Carlo Acceptance Probability called (QWOA-EMC). Unlike WOA, QWOA-EMC permits just-in-time adaptive selection of its operators (i.e., between shrinking mechanism, spiral shape mechanism, and random generation) based on their historical performances as well as exploits the Monte Carlo Acceptance probability to further strengthen its exploration capabilities by allowing a poor performing operator to be reselected with probability in the early part of the iteration. Experimental results for constraints combinatorial test generation demonstrate that the proposed QWOA-EMC outperforms WOA and performs competitively against other metaheuristic algorithms.

ID RAIN STREAKS REMOVAL; MODEL
AB Rain removal is very important for many applications in computer vision, and it is a challenging problem due to its ill-posed nature, especially for single-image deraining. In order to remove rain streaks more thoroughly, as well as to retain more details, a progressive dilation dense residual fusion network is proposed. The entire network is designed in a cascade manner with multiple fusion blocks. The fusion block consists of a dilation dense residual block (DDRB) and a dense residual feature fusion block (DRFFB), where DDRB is created for feature extraction and DRFFB is mainly designed for feature fusion operation. Meanwhile, detail compensation memory mechanism (DCMM) is leveraged between each of two cascade modules to retain more background details. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, extensive experiments show that the proposed method can achieve better results, in terms of rain streaks removal and background details preservation. Furthermore, the authors' network also shows its superiority for image noise removal.
   The dilation dense residual blocks (DDRBs) are proposed for obtaining the hierarchical features. Each DDRB consists of dense residual connections and dilation convolutions with different receptive fields.The dense residual feature fusion blocks are designed to deal with the proper fusions between each pair of DDRBs, as well as between the last DDRB and the next convolution module, which enhance local features fusion.A detail compensation memory mechanism is introduced into progressive dilation dense residual fusion network for retaining more details. It also makes the current DDRB pass important information to the next DDRB, ensuring continuous transfer for important information.Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparative experimental results manifest that the authors' proposed method achieves better performance for deraining task. To further demonstrate the generalization of the proposed method, the authors apply the network for denoising task and achieve better results.image

AB The amount of data needed to effectively train modern deep neural architectures has grown significantly, leading to increased computational requirements. These intensive computations are tackled by the combination of last generation computing resources, such as accelerators, or classic processing units. Nevertheless, gradient communication remains as the major bottleneck, hindering the efficiency notwithstanding the improvements in runtimes obtained through data parallelism strategies. Data parallelism involves all processes in a global exchange of potentially high amount of data, which may impede the achievement of the desired speedup and the elimination of noticeable delays or bottlenecks. As a result, communication latency issues pose a significant challenge that profoundly impacts the performance on distributed platforms. This research presents node-based optimization steps to significantly reduce the gradient exchange between model replicas whilst ensuring model convergence. The proposal serves as a versatile communication scheme, suitable for integration into a wide range of general-purpose deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. The optimization takes into consideration the specific location of each replica within the platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness, different neural network approaches and datasets with disjoint properties are used. In addition, multiple types of applications are considered to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our proposal. The experimental results show a global training time reduction whilst slightly improving accuracy.

AB The transformer, a type of neural architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance improvements in vision and natural language tasks. While overcoming the disadvantages of limited perceptual field and non-adaptive input content exhibited in CNNs, the computational complexity of the Transformer model increases quadratically with spatial resolution. As such, this model is not frequently employed in image processing tasks such as image denoising, and there is a shortage of studies that investigate ultrasonic image multiplication speckle removal. In light of this, we present TranSpeckle, an effective and efficient despeckle architecture that employs Multi-Dconv Head Transposed Attention and Dconv Feed-Forward Network as the core components of its Transformer block. Multiple Transformer blocks are then utilized to implement a hierarchical encoder-decoder network. TranSpeckle architecture considerably reduces the computational complexity of feature maps while also effectively capturing long-range pixel interactions and local context information. In this study, an edge protection module is combined to augment the edges of ultrasound images. The module incorporates extracted image edge features into the TranSpeckle architecture, which ameliorates the issue of edge information loss engendered by the image despeckling process. Extensive experimental results clearly show that our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality.
   A novel denoising network, TranSpeckle, is proposed to remove speckle noise from medical ultrasound images. It utilizes a Transformer block to efficiently capture global contextual relationships without compromising computational efficiency. Additionally, an edge protection module is incorporated to enhance edges, improving the overall despeckling effect of ultrasound images.image

AB When using evolutionary algorithms to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems, both the constraint handling technique and the search operator play a crucial role. However, existing algorithms always focus on the former for the promising solution selection while neglecting the importance of the latter for the feasible solution generation. In this article, we emphasize the role of the search operator and propose a model-driven offspring generation method for evolutionary constrained multi-objective optimization. To be specific, the growing neural gas network is used to collect the feasibility information during the evolutionary search process and gradually model the distribution of feasible regions in the decision space. In order to make use of infeasible solutions to assist in the modeling of feasible regions, both feasible and infeasible solutions are taken as two classes of samples to train the network in the supervised learning manner. The proposed method can utilize the learning network to generate the promising offspring and thus make the population converge faster toward the optimal feasible regions. Experimental results on three public test suites demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach, especially on the test problems with complicated feasible regions.

AB Wake re-categorization (RECAT) has been implemented to improve runway capacity, and consequently, aircraft arrival runway occupancy time has become a crucial factor influencing runway capacity. Accurate prediction of the runway occupancy time can assist controllers in determining aircraft separation, thereby enhancing the operational efficiency of the runway. In this study, the GA-PSO algorithm is utilized to optimize the Back Propagation neural network prediction model using Quick access recorder data from various domestic airports, achieving high-precision prediction. Additionally, the SHapley Additive explanation model is applied to quantify the effect of each characteristic parameter on the arrival runway occupancy time, resulting in the prediction of aircraft arrival runway occupancy time. This model can provide a foundation for improving runway operation efficiency and technical support for the design of airport runway and taxiway structure.

AB Session-based recommendation(SBR) is a hot research direction, and how to solve the problem of sparse data in sessions is a challenging task. Although the existingmodelmirror graph enhanced neural model for session-based recommendation(MGS) solves the problem of data sparsity by introducing additional information from items, this model is still unable to model the general interest of the session well due to the limitations of data attribute information and the interference of noise, resulting in a certain amount of room for improvement in recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Global-Mirror Graph Model for Session-based Recommendation (GMGS), based on the research work related to MGS models, combining global graph modeling and reverse position awareness. Specifically, the GMGS model first builds a global graph based on all item transformations, and uses this to capture contextual information between sessions, thereby completing the modeling of general session interests. Then, a gating mechanism is used to combine reverse position information and the last click to obtain a session representation for final prediction. Finally, we conducted a large number of comparative experiments on three real datasets, and the GMGS model proposed in this paper achieved better results than the current representative recommendation models. Compared with the MGS model, the MRR@20 indicator has increased by 2.6%, 0.6%, and 6.5% on the three datasets, respectively. In addition, we also conducted ablation experiments on three datasets to verify the effectiveness of each component improvement.

AB A familiar nervous system disorder characterised by seizures is called as Epilepsy. It is indeed hard to control the suitable type as an outcome of insufficient EEG information. In order to overcome these issues, a Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN)-based classifier is proposed to recognise if the patients are affected by epileptic disease or not. EEG signal is a contribution, and the input signal is preprocessed using antialiasing filter, finite impulse response, and band pass filter to eradicate unwanted noise present in the signal. After preprocessing, the features extracting process is done, and four extraction techniques are proposed in order to calculate the feature coefficient. The feature extraction outcome is fed into the MLNN classifier to predict the disease. MLNN performs with Coot-Optimization to reduce error and increase prediction accuracy. The future ideal applied in Matlab-software carried out numerous act metrics, and these parameters attained better performance such as accuracy of 96.5%, error of 0.03, precision of 98%, specificity is 97%, sensitivity is 95%, and so on. This displays the effectiveness of the future ideal than existing approaches such as ANN, SVM, KNN and NB. Based on this proposed classification, the epileptic disease prediction can be improved on this technique and can provide a living standard for patients.

AB In this paper, we investigate a new approach based on a combination of three-dimensional (3D) facial images and deep transfer learning (TL) with fine-grained image classification (FGIC) for quantitative evaluation of facial attractiveness. The 3D facial surface images of patients with and without filtering and the publicly available SCUT-FBP5500 dataset was used for transfer training and model pre-training, respectively. Experimental results show that a bilinear CNN model with a Gaussian filter freezing 80 % of the weights exhibit the strongest performance and lowest average error as a deep learning prediction model; the model was subsequently adopted for automatic assessment of facial attractiveness in clinical application. This is the first TL model with FGIC using 3D facial images for automatic quantitative evaluation of facial attractiveness in patients undergoing Orthognathic surgery (OGS). The developed web browser-based user interface enables effective and rapid assessment, thus contributing to effective patient-clinician communication and decision-making.

ID NETWORK
AB Video question answering (VideoQA) has attracted much interest from of scholars as one of the most representative multimodal tasks in recent years. The task requires the model to interact and reason between the video and the question. Most known approaches use pre-trained networks to extract complex embeddings of videos and questions independently before performing multimodal fusion. However, they overlook two factors: (1) These feature extractors are pre-trained for the image or video classification task without taking the question into consideration, therefore may not be suitable for VideoQA task. (2) Using multiple feature extractors to extract features at different levels introduce more irrelevant information to some extent, thus making the task more difficult. For the above reasons, we propose a new model named Spatio-Temporal Two-Stage Fusion, which ties together multiple levels of feature extraction processes and divides them into two distinct stages: spatial fusion and temporal fusion. Specifically, in the spatial fusion stage, we use Vision Transformer to integrate the intra-frame information to generate frame-level features. At the same time, we design a multimodal temporal fusion module that enables the video to fuse textual information and assign different levels of attention to each frame. Then the obtained frame-level features are used to generate global video features by another Vision Transformer. In order to efficiently generate modal interaction information, we design a video-text symmetric fusion module to retain the most relevant information by mutual guidance between the two modalities. Our method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA and TGIF-QA, and achieves competitive results.

AB Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems are static in nature and does not adapt well with changing user preferences. User preferences may change after interaction with a system or after buying a product. Conventional CF clustering algorithms only identifies the distribution of patterns and hidden correlations globally. However, the impossibility of discovering local patterns by these algorithms, headed to the popularization of bi-clustering algorithms. Bi-clustering algorithms can analyze all dataset dimensions simultaneously and consequently, discover local patterns that deliver a better understanding of the underlying hidden correlations. In this paper, we modelled the recommendation problem as a sequential decision-making problem using Markov Decision Processes (MDP). To perform state representation for MDP, we first converted user-item votings matrix to a binary matrix. Then we performed bi-clustering on this binary matrix to determine a subset of similar rows and columns. A bi-cluster merging algorithm is designed to merge similar and overlapping bi-clusters. These biclusters are then mapped to a squared grid (SG). RL is applied on this SG to determine best policy to give recommendation to users. Start state is determined using Improved Triangle Similarity (ITR similarity measure. Reward function is computed as grid state overlapping in terms of users and items in current and prospective next state. A thorough comparative analysis was conducted, encompassing a diverse array of methodologies, including RL-based, pure Collaborative Filtering (CF), and clustering methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms its competitors in terms of precision, recall, and optimal policy learning.

AB A metaheuristic-based structural optimization method, whilst being popularly adopted due to its advantages in by-passing gradient function calculations, requires the use of time-consuming advanced analyses for constraint evaluation. To overcome this drawback, the present paper proposes a robust (machine learning-based) optimization method that combines the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) with the efficient p-best differential evolution (EpDE) method. In essence, the LightGBM classification model is constructed to assess the constraint (safety and integrity) satisfaction of structures. An efficient framework using a so-called safety parameter is proposed to prevent inaccurate predictions of the LightGBM model. The EpDE processes the optimization procedures on the constructed classification LightGBM model. This enables an enhanced machine learning-based optimization technique that not only maintains the sufficiently accurate optimal design of structures but also significantly reduces the required computing efforts, as compared to standard optimization schemes. Various examples of steel structure designs (i.e., two of which have been provided herein) have been successfully performed by the proposed approach. These illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, where good comparisons with reference algorithms (including standard DE with "DE/rand/1" mutational strategy, Jaya, Rao-1 and CaDE) are evidenced. The statistical values collected present the accuracy and reliability of the proposed method in obtaining the minimum total weight designs with substantial (some 60%) reduction of computing efforts required to furnish optimal results.

AB Graph convolution is a fundamental building block for many deep neural networks on graph-structured data. In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet very effective graph convolutional network with skip connections for semi-supervised anomaly detection. The proposed layerwise propagation rule of our model is theoretically motivated by the concept of implicit fairing in geometry processing, and comprises a graph convolution module for aggregating information from immediate node neighbors and a skip connection module for combining layer-wise neighborhood representations. This propagation rule is derived from the iterative solution of the implicit fairing equation via the Jacobi method. In addition to capturing information from distant graph nodes through skip connections between the network's layers, our approach exploits both the graph structure and node features for learning discriminative node representations. These skip connections are integrated by design in our proposed network architecture. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, achieving better or comparable anomaly detection results against strong baseline methods. We also demonstrate through an ablation study that skip connection helps improve the model performance.

AB The human skin, the largest organ with multiple layered functionalities, houses melanocytes in the deeper strata of its epidermis. These cells can be adversely impacted by ultraviolet radiation, thereby instigating melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer. Failure to detect melanoma at an early stage can potentially lead to metastasis, forming complex tumors in other tissues. Despite substantial efforts, visual inspections can occasionally overlook melanoma cases due to inherent subjectivity. To surmount this challenge, an automated detection system is necessary. Recent attempts to establish such a system have predominantly employed "push-through"strategies involving deep (neural) networks and their ensembles, which however necessitate significant computational resources. This paper presents a novel approach, amalgamating a conventional machine learning technique, Bag of Visual Words, with a pretrained deep neural network for comprehensive deep feature extraction from enhanced input image patches. The proposed method, assessed on the ISIC Challenge 2017 dataset, surpassed all other entries on the challenge leader-board, registering an accuracy of 96.2% in the task of lesion classification.

New velocity-based stabilizing controllers of an autonomous nonholonomic two-wheeled self-balancing personalized Segway robot are extracted from a total potential developed by employing the Lyapunov-based Control Scheme (LbCS) for navigation in a partially known environment. Velocity controllers' cost and time effectiveness and efficiency result from the interaction of the three prominent pillars of LbCS: smoothest, shortest, and safest path for motion planning. Furthermore, the autonomous personal transporter has an obstacle avoidance sensor with a limited detection range ideal for fast navigation in dynamic environments with narrow corridors, tracks, and pathways. This also successfully facilitates navigation in a partially known environment where the sensors only receive and avoid static and dynamic obstacles in a limited range. The results are numerically validated, and the efficacy of the new controllers is exemplified via computer simulations, which illustrate the forward, backward, and zero-turn radius maneuvers of the Segway robot. Introducing the particular autonomous personal transporter would contribute to transportation systems of smart cities.

ID QUESTIONS; ALGORITHM
AB Community question answering (CQA) websites have grown rapidly, but they face a gap between questions and answerers. This gap causes delays in getting answers and overwhelms potential answerers. Expert recommendation (ER) can bridge this gap by providing suitable answerers for the newly posted questions in time. However, most ER methods have some limitations. First, they focus on the representation of a user's interest, but they ignore their ability to give high-quality answers (user expertise). Second, they do not consider that the answerers' interests and expertise may change over time. Third, they only use the accepted answer as a good example, but they ignore other good answers that are not accepted. To address these issues, we propose MATER, a Bi-level Matching-Aggregation Model for Time-Aware Expert Recommendation to address these issues. MATER utilizes a matching-aggregation framework at two levels of sentence and question. MATER first matches the target question with each question in the user's profile by a sentence-level matching-aggregation model. Next, the question matching results are aggregated by a proposed multi-perspective time-aware aggregation layer that considers both time-aware interest and expertise of a user. We propose to employ a listwise loss function to train our model, which takes into consideration all potential experts in the ranking strategy. Experimental results on six real-world CQA datasets from different domains demonstrate that MATER significantly outperforms state-ofthe-art ER methods.

AB Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) emerged thanks to the development of deep neural networks. Forgery images generated by various variants of GANs are widely spread on the Internet, which may be damage personal credibility and cause huge property losses. Thus, numerous methods are proposed to detect forgery images, but most of them are designed to detect forgery faces. Therefore, a method to detect forgery images of various scenes is proposed. In this work, central difference convolution and vanilla convolution (CDC-Mix) are mixed after considering the depth and width features of neural networks and analyzing the influence of attention on network performance. Based on CDC-Mix, a separable convolution (SeparableCDC-Mix) is proposed. The proposed method consists of three parts: (1) CDC-Mix and SeparableCDC-Mix are used to extract the gradient information and texture features; (2) CDCM is used to extract the multi-scale information of the image; (3) multi-scale fusion module (MS-Fusion) is used to fuse the multi-scale information from different locations of the network. A large number of experiments have been carried out on several datasets generated by GAN, and the experimental results show that the proposed method has a great improvement compared with the existing advanced methods.
   We propose SeparableCDC-Mix to learn the image features. In addition, CDCM is introduced to extract the multi-scale information of the image. To organically integrate multi-scale features extracted by CDCM, we propose an MS-Fusion module.image

AB In this paper, we propose a new generalization of the zero-truncated negative binomial distribution using the Lagrange expansion of the second kind, which we call the Lagrangian zero-truncated negative binomial distribution (LZTNBD). The proposed distribution's formulation and properties, including its mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, factorial moment, and index of dispersion, are studied. Because of the various shapes of the hazard rate function, the new distribution reveals great flexibility. Using the equivalence theorem of the class of Lagrangian distribution, we show that the LZTNBD belongs to the Lagrangian family of the first kind. We estimate the unknown parameters of the LZTNBD using the method of maximum likelihood. The performance of the estimates is evaluated through a broad simulation study. We employ the mean-parameterized form of the LZTNBD to present a novel count regression model that is apt for both overdispersed and underdispersed situations. To further illustrate the relevance and applicability of the proposed model, real-world data sets are employed.

AB Big data analytics is essential for many industries that use computing applications, like real-time purchasing and e-commerce. Big data is used to promote products and improve the communication among retailers and shoppers. At present, individuals frequently utilize online promotions to identify the best shops for purchasing higher-quality goods. This shopping experience shared on social media platforms can be used to observe the opinions regarding the shoppers shop. New customers search the shop for knowing information about manufacturing date (MRD), manufacturing price (MRP), offers, quality, and suggestions. All these information are provided only through previous customer experience. On the product cover or label, the MRP and MRD are already available. Numerous methods have been employed to predict the details of product, but none of them provides accurate details. To overcome these issues, binarized spiking neural networks optimized with Nomadic People Optimization-based sentiment analysis is proposed for social product recommendations (BSNN-NPO). The product-product (P-P) similarity and collaborative filtering (CF) techniques are used for modeling the new recommendation system. The P-P similarity approach predicts the best products, while CF method predicts the best shops. The product data along customer reviews is gathered through Amazon product recommendation. From the results and comparison, it is found that the proposed BSNN-NPO method outperforms than other approaches. The performance of proposed technique offers higher mean absolute percentage error 38.56%, 23.67%, and 30.22% and lower mean squared error 34.67%, 45.7%, and 15.21% compared to the existing models, respectively.

In this approach, a nonlinear function is introduced to predict the response variables based on the kernel function. To estimate the parameters of regression model, the objective function is calculated using the quantile loss function on fuzzy numbers. To evaluate the goodness of fit of the optimal quantile fuzzy regression models, two indices are introduced using the similarity measures. Based on the presented results, the proposed fuzzy regression models have the perfect performances on the original data and also in the presences of different types of outliers.

AB Graph representation learning aims to learn low-dimensional representation for the graph, which has played a vital role in real-world applications. Without requiring additional labeled data, contrastive learning based graph representation learning (or graph contrastive learning) has attracted considerable attention. Recently, one of the most exciting advancement in graph contrastive learning is Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), which maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) between the node and graph representations. However, DGI only considers the contextual node information, ignoring the intrinsic node information (i.e., the similarity between node representations in different views). In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-scale Contrastive Triplet Networks (CCTN) framework, which captures both contextual and intrinsic node information for graph representation learning. Specifically, to obtain the contextual node information, we utilize an infomax contrastive network to maximize the MI between node and graph representations. For acquiring the intrinsic node information, we present a Siamese contrastive network by maximizing the similarity between node representations in different augmented views. Two contrastive networks learn together through a shared graph convolution network to form our cross-scale contrastive triplet networks. Finally, we evaluate CCTN on six real-world datasets. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CCTN achieves state-of-the-art performance on node classification and clustering tasks.

AB This study expands on the investigation of the vehicle routing problem with cross-dock (VRPCD) by incorporating disruption in a network with suppliers, customers, and a single cross-dock. It is assumed that the disruption (e.g., traffic accident or mechanical failure) impacts the scheduled pickup times of vehicles carrying freight; hence, pickup or delivery is affected by late vehicle arrivals to suppliers, cross-docks, and customers as well as increased transportation cost for the carrier. To help decision makers mitigate the impact of this type of disruption, mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) are developed to model VRPCD with time-window constraints under both normal and disrupted conditions that will quantify the impact of disruption. The Golden Ball metaheuristic is adapted to provide an optimal or near-optimal solution of the MILPs in a short time period. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms, numerical experiments are performed on hypothetical networks containing a realistic number of pickup and delivery locations. Results from numerical experiments and ANOVA analysis showed that: 1) the cross-dock is able to cope with the disruption when the number of disrupted nodes is small, 2) early breakdown of an inbound vehicle with fewer nodes on its routes causes smaller service delays, 3) as the number of disrupted nodes increases, it is advantageous to reroute outbound vehicles, and 4) when the breakdown occurs earlier in the planning horizon, it is better to reroute both inbound and outbound vehicles whereas only outbound vehicles should be rerouted when the breakdown happens later in the day.

TI MCRSpell: A metric learning of correct representation for Chinese
   spelling correction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Metric learning; Chinese spelling correction; Computational linguistics;
   Natural language processing
AB Chinese spelling correction (CSC) is a difficult but gratifying work that not only helps individuals read and understand the material in their daily lives but also serves as pre-processing for numerous natural language processing (NLP) applications. With pre-trained language models like BERT, many recent works have had great success. However, these methods have three limitations. Firstly, they rely on the output of the last layer of the correction model for parameter updates, ignoring the guidance of intermediate features. This can prevent the model from being adequately trained and thus lead to overfitting. Secondly, they use a variety of data augmentations, which depend on expert knowledge. Some specific augmentation rules only improve the performance on the target dataset, and for out-of-set data, the performance decreases instead. Thirdly, due to the nature of statistical models, they tend to transform low-frequency expressions into more common high-frequency expressions, although correct expressions should be preserved as much as possible for error correction tasks. In this work, we propose a novel general framework for CSC that takes advantage of metric learning to learn semantic knowledge adaptively from multiple intermediate features. Our approach only feeds the input text and target text of the parallel corpus to the model separately for the spelling error correction task without any data augmentation. Moreover, we designed a replication mechanism to keep those low-frequency correct expressions instead of over-correcting them. Our suggested solution can greatly outperform the SOTA methods in the CSC problem, according to extensive trials on benchmarks. We will release the source code for further use by the community.

   Self-supervised learning
AB Object pose estimation is important for object manipulation and scene understanding. In order to improve the general applicability of pose estimators, recent research focuses on providing estimates for novel objects, that is, objects unseen during training. Such works use deep template matching strategies to retrieve the closest template connected to a query image, which implicitly provides object class and pose. Despite the recent success and improvements of Vision Transformers over CNNs for many vision tasks, the state of the art uses CNN-based approaches for novel object pose estimation. This work evaluates and demonstrates the differences between self-supervised CNNs and Vision Transformers for deep template matching. In detail, both types of approaches are trained using contrastive learning to match training images against rendered templates of isolated objects. At test time such templates are matched against query images of known and novel objects under challenging settings, such as clutter, occlusion and object symmetries, using masked cosine similarity. The presented results not only demonstrate that Vision Transformers improve matching accuracy over CNNs but also that for some cases pre-trained Vision Transformers do not need fine-tuning to achieve the improvement. Furthermore, we highlight the differences in optimization and network architecture when comparing these two types of networks for deep template matching.

AB A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), integrated with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and based on electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, allows users to control external devices by decoding brainwave patterns. Advanced deep learning-based BCIs, especially those utilizing sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs), have emerged as direct brain-device communication facilitators. SMRs involve users imagining limb motions to induce specific brain activity changes in the motor cortex. Despite progress, some users struggle with BCIs due to weak signals, individual variability, and limited task applicability. This study introduces an unsupervised EEG preprocessing pipeline for SMR-based BCIs. It evaluates an EEG dataset recorded during finger movements, employing two cleaning methods: an investigator-dependent pipeline and our proposed unsupervised method. Two distinct feature datasets are generated: one from cleaned EEG data processed into spectrogram images using supervised preprocessing, and another from data cleaned using our proposed unsupervised pipeline. The study extensively assesses five transfer learning convolutional neural network (TL-CNN) models for distinguishing Motor Imagery (MI) from finger movements (Mex) using the generated datasets. A novel probability fusion technique is developed to enhance TL-CNN classification in Mex versus MI finger-pinching actions. Comparative results show that the fusion-based method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods when applied to unsupervised EEG data. Specifically, our proposed approach achieves 97.9% accuracy, 93.4% precision, 95% recall, and an F1-score of 93.2%, demonstrating significant progress in distinguishing MI and Mex activities through the use of our unsupervised pre-processing pipeline and fusion-based CNN method. Our findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to serve as a benchmark for the global interdisciplinary research community and enable the development of future more effective and user-friendly real-time BCI systems.

DE Recurrent Neural Network testing; Test case selection; Clustering;
   Uncertainty
AB Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a typical feedback neural network, which is particularly effective in processing time-series data tasks such as image description, text generation and classification, etc. However, its safety and quality issues have aroused strong concern in academia and industry. One of the most commonly used methods to ensure RNN-driven software quality is testing and optimizing RNN. Its core idea is to introduce human efforts to label test cases so that many labeled test cases can be used to trigger faults in RNNs. But this brings a huge overhead. Therefore, it is of great importance to study the test case selection method for RNN. Current research on test case selection for RNN has achieved some results from the stateful view of RNN, but there are still some problems, such as a low bug detection rate, poor inclusiveness, and lack of diversity.In this paper, according to the structural characteristics of RNN, we propose a method of RNN test case selection, RNNtcs, which combines clustering and uncertainty, in order to select test cases that can touch RNN bugs as much as possible, thus reducing the cost of labeling. In order to evaluate RNNtcs, we conduct experiments on popular image datasets, text datasets and RNN models. The experimental results show that RNNtcs is superior to the state-of-the-art approach DeepState in bug detection effectiveness, bug detection inclusiveness and bug detection diversity. The test cases selected by RNNtcs can effectively improve the robustness of the RNN model.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Investigating interactions between image and text can effectively improve image-text sentiment analysis, but most existing methods do not explore image-text interaction at fine-grained level. In this paper, we propose a Memory-enhanced Collaborative Fine-grained Interaction Transformer (MCFIT) to learn collaborative fine-grained interaction between image and text. Specifically, a multi-branch encoder is designed to learn both fine-grained region-word and patch-word interactions. Meanwhile, Memory-enhanced Cross-Attention (MECA) is proposed to utilize patch and region information to improve region-word interaction and patch-word interaction learning, respectively. Therefore, collaborative fine-grained interaction can yield more accurate image-text interaction. Finally, to analyze the sentiments embedded in real-life Chinese image-text pairs, we build a large-scale Chinese image-text sentiment dataset (CISD) containing 54,931 image-text pairs. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-life datasets prove the effectiveness of collaborative fine-grained interaction and demonstrate that MCFIT outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB Mechanical metamaterials are artificial materials with unique global properties due to the structural geometry and material composition of their unit cell. Typically, mechanical metamaterial unit cells are designed such that, when tessellated, they exhibit unique mechanical properties such as zero or negative Poisson's ratio and negative stiffness. Beyond these applications, mechanical metamaterials can be used to achieve tailorable nonlinear deformation responses. Computational methods such as gradient-based topology optimization (TO) and size/ shape optimization (SSO) can be implemented to design these metamaterials. However, both methods can lead to suboptimal solutions or a lack of generalizability. Therefore, this research used deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a subset of deep machine learning that teaches an agent to complete tasks through interactive experiences, to design mechanical metamaterials with specific nonlinear deformation responses in compression or tension. The agent learned to design the unit cells by sequentially adding material to a discrete design domain and being rewarded for achieving the desired deformation response. After training, the agent successfully designed unit cells to exhibit desired deformation responses not experienced during training. This work shows the potential of DRL as a high-level design tool for a wide array of engineering applications.

AB Artificial intelligence based on deep learning is better at improving the representation ability of models from data. However, due to the limitation of fixed receptive field, these agents are not able to provide a correct response outside the fixed receptive field. To address this problem, this paper provides a new perspective with improving the Image Recognition tasks. This study firstly constructs two extended receptive fields using structural causal model. Then, an approximate intervention method that changes the traditional likelihood prediction to predict the result of causal intervention is proposed. Finally, this study formulates the objective function to adapt the proxy training, which makes the whole model work well. Above all of these, a new Vision Transformer variant named Causal-ViT is proposed. Furthermore, rich experimental results of different tasks are reported. These results show that the proposed perspective makes a significant improvement in Image Recognition tasks. By simply plugging Causal-ViT to different sub-tasks, all of them bring the new benchmarks of themselves field, which proves our method is flexible.

TI Disentanglement then reconstruction: Unsupervised domain adaptation by

SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English

DE Unsupervised domain adaptation; Disentanglement; Prototypes; Compact
   features
AB Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Traditional methods usually achieve domain adaptation by aligning the distributions between two domains once. We propose to align the distributions twice by a disentanglement and reconstruction process, named DTR (Disentanglement Then Reconstruction). Specifically, a feature extraction network shared by both source and target domains is used to obtain the original extracted features, then the domain invariant features and domain specific features are disentangled from the original extracted features. The domain distributions are explicitly aligned when disentangling domain invariant features. Based on the disentangled features, the class prototypes and domain prototypes can be estimated. Then, a reconstructor is trained by the disentangled features. By this reconstructor, we can construct prototypes in the original feature space using the corresponding class prototype and domain prototype similarly. The extracted features are forced to close the corresponding constructed prototypes. In this process, the distribution between two domains is implicitly aligned again. Experiment results on several public datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method.

TI Adversarial image generation by spatial transformation in perceptual

SO PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE Adversarial examples; Deep learning; Perceptual colorspace
AB Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. The amount of these perturbations are generally quantified using Cp metrics, such as C0, C2 and C infinity. However, even when the measured perturbations are small, they tend to be noticeable by human observers since Cp distance metrics are not representative of human perception. On the other hand, humans are less sensitive to changes in colorspace. In addition, pixel shifts in a constrained neighborhood are hard to notice. Motivated by these observations, we propose a method that creates adversarial examples by applying spatial transformations, which creates adversarial examples by changing the pixel locations independently to chrominance channels of perceptual colorspaces such as YCbCr and CIELAB, instead of making an additive perturbation or manipulating pixel values directly. In a targeted white-box attack setting, the proposed method is able to obtain competitive fooling rates with very high confidence. The experimental evaluations show that the proposed method has favorable results in terms of approximate perceptual distance between benign and adversarially generated images.

AB Data-driven soft sensors are crucial for predicting key quality variables in the process industry. In most processes, the dynamic characteristics are obvious, and the relationship between the primary and secondary variables is strongly nonlinear. Moreover, the worst thing is that labeled samples are usually scarce due to certain technical difficulties or measurement costs. To deal with these issues, this paper first proposes a semi -supervised manifold regularization model based on dual representation (SsMRM-DR). Then, a semi-supervised local manifold regularization model based on dual representation (SsLMRM-DR) is further proposed from the viewpoint of local manifold regularization. In the SsLMRM-DR, a space-time weighted similarity calculation method is designed to reduce the influence of measurement noise on similarity calculation. At the same time, a local manifold regularization method is developed to use unlabeled samples more efficiently and to improve the prediction accuracy and computational efficiency of the SsLMRM-DR. A numerical example and a real industrial process are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The results show that SsLMRM-DR is effective and it has a good application prospect of soft sensors in the industry.

DE Link prediction; Knowledge graph embedding; Multisource knowledge
   information; Hierarchical embedding network; Highway MLP
AB Link prediction for knowledge graphs aims to obtain missing nodes in triples. In recent years, link prediction methods have made specific achievements in knowledge graph embedding. However, knowledge graphs are characteristic of the heterogeneity of multiple types of entities and relations. A vital issue is efficiently extracting complex graph information and constructing a knowledge-semantic fusion of multiple features. To overcome these issues, a novel link prediction framework based on a multisource hierarchical neural network for knowledge graph embedding (MSHE) is proposed. In particular, mapping functions obtain entities and relations from low-to high-dimensional mapping sources. The combination of mapping sources and entity-relation sources constitutes multisource knowledge information, which facilitates the integration of complex heterogeneous entities and relations. Unlike training a single independent network, the hierarchical embedding network proposed in this paper accumulates feature information at multiple levels. Then, to fuse feature information, our Highway multilayer perceptron (MLP) inductively generates high-quality knowledge information. Through extensive experiments, MSHE's knowledge graph embedding outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines on FB15k-237 and YAGO3-10. Furthermore, MSHE achieves a Hits@10 score that is 3.8% and 2.7% higher than that of ComplexGCN on FB15K-237 and WN18RR, respectively. MSHE achieves a higher score in Hits@1 than DCN 10.0% in the dataset YAGO3-10. The experiments show that the MSHE achieved excellent results in the four datasets of comparative experiments.

DE Radiology reports generation; Auxiliary signal; Attention mechanism;

AB Automatically generating medical image reports is a gratifying task. For doctors, it can reduce the heavy burden of writing reports, and for patients, it can reduce the waiting time for reports; it can also avoid misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses caused by human factors. However, this task still faces enormous challenges due to the problem of visual and textual data bias and the complex relationships among the components of medical reports. To this end, in this work, we propose an auxiliary signal guidance and memory-driven (ASGMD) network that can be used to generate medical reports automatically. It includes three modules: an Auxiliary Signal Guidance Module (ASG), a text sequential attention mechanism (TSAM) module, and a Memory Mechanism-Driven Decoding Module (MMDD). Given a medical image of a patient, radiologists usually focus on the abnormal area first, then browse the global information included in the image and write a corresponding report. Similar to the above working mode, the ASG module enhances the features of the abnormal areas of medical images by introducing auxiliary signals that alleviate the problem of visual data bias. We design a novel TSAM module that explores the consistency of medical report context and enhances essential medical information in reports to reduce textual data bias. Finally, the MMDD module integrates visual and textual knowledge to achieve dynamic decoding and generate a final report. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models on various evaluation metrics on the two public datasets, IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR. To make our results reproducible, our code has been released at https://github.com/shangchengLu/ASGMDN.

DE Second order optimizer; Fisher information matrix; Trust region; Neural
   network; Gradient descent
AB We introduce Tadam (Trust region ADAptive Moment estimation), a new optimizer based on the trust region of the second-order approximation of the loss using the Fisher information matrix. Despite the enhanced gradient estimations offered by second-order approximations, their practical implementation requires sizable batch sizes to estimate the second-order approximation matrices and perform matrix inversions. Consequently, integrating second-order approximations entails additional memory consumption and imposes substantial computational demands due to the inversion of large matrices. In light of these challenges, we have devised a second-order approximation algorithm that mitigates these issues by judiciously approximating the pertinent large matrix, requiring only a marginal increase in memory usage while minimizing the computational burden. Tadam approximates the loss up to the second order using the Fisher information matrix. Since estimating the Fisher information matrix is expensive in both memory and time, Tadam approximates the Fisher information matrix and reduces the computational burdens to the O(N) level. Furthermore, Tadam employs an adaptive trust region scheme to reduce approximate errors and guarantee stability. Tadam evaluates how well it minimizes the loss function and uses this information to adjust the trust region dynamically. In addition, Tadam adjusts the learning rate internally, even if we provide the learning rate as a fixed constant. We run several experiments to measure Tadam's performance against Adam, AMSGrad, Radam, and Nadam, which have the same space and time complexity as Tadam. The test results show that Tadam outperforms the benchmarks and finds reasonable solutions fast and stably.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   optimization
AB Entity alignment (EA) aims to discover unique equivalent entity pairs with the same meaning across different knowledge graphs (KG), which is a crucial step for expanding the scale of KGs. Existing EA methods commonly leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to align entities. However, these methods inherit the complex structure of GNNs, which results in lower efficiency. Meanwhile, most EA methods are either limited in their performance due to insufficient utilization of available information or require extensive manual preprocessing to obtain additional information. Furthermore, seed alignment acquisition is challenging for most EA methods that rely on supervised learning. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective unsupervised EA model named COEA. COEA leverages the entity name information to obtain reliable supplementary information for EA and enhances performance by combining text features captured by entity names with structural features of the KG. Importantly, COEA inherits the advantages of GNN while reducing redundancy. It only uses the way of aggregating neighbor features in graph convolutional network (GCN), and transforms the EA problems into combination optimization problems. Sufficient experimental of COEA on five datasets have validated the exceptional performance and generalization capabilities of the framework. COEA achieved the best performance in all performance indicators. Notably, the framework enables the rapid implementation of entity alignment with minimal computational delays.

   A two-step approach

AB We introduce Hopfield-Energy-Based Learning, a general learning framework that is inspired by energy-based models, to train feedforward neural nets. Our approach includes two training phases applied iteratively: first, the minimization of the internal energy, which captures dependencies between input samples and network parameters, is carried out in an unsupervised manner; second, the problem-dependent supervised external energy (e.g., cross-entropy loss) combined with partially reversed internal energy gradients are back-propagated in a standard manner. The intuition is that the first stage helps parameters to settle into the state that simply partitions data into clusters; while in the second stage, the network is allowed to deviate from that clustering a bit (hence gradient reversal) in order to converge to parameters that ultimately perform well on the task at hand. Notably, the data used for the two steps might not be one and the same (e.g., can come from different domains) and the approach naturally tailors itself to solve unsupervised domain adaptation problems without adopting any distribution alignment techniques. We also show that the proposed training strategy substantially improves the performance of several ConvNets on standard supervised classification tasks; showing improvements of at least 1.2% (2.64% on CIFAR-10, 4.5% on CIFAR-100, and 1.35% on ImageNet). Our formulation is general, performs well in practice, and holds promise for scenarios where labeled data is limited.

AB In the mixed-model assembly job-shops, all the components are transferred in batches from the processing stage to the assembly stage to reduce transportation costs and timely satisfy the assembly material requirements. However, batch transfer in such a workshop has not received due attention in the current literature. Thus, this work addresses the mixed-model assembly job-shop scheduling problem with batch transfer via a mathematical model and an augmented simulated annealing algorithm to minimize manufacturing and transportation costs. The mathematical model takes batch transfer constraints into account and constructs the temporal and spatial links among the processing, transfer, and assembly stages. Production sequencing knowledge and batch transfer knowledge are first extracted via gene expression programming algorithm and clustering method and then implanted into the algorithmic operators in the form of rules and strategies to directly identify the promising solution space. Besides, eleven neighborhood structures including the critical component-based and batch based ones, are designed to enhance the exploitation ability. A restart mechanism considering crossover and tempering helps to get out of local optima. Experimental results indicate that by adopting the extracted knowledge, problem-specific neighborhood structures, and restart mechanism, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in fixing the studied problem.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is an important work in product reliability design. It can identify the weak links and key items in design through fault analysis, and provide basic information for evaluating and improving the reliability of system design. In view of the shortcomings of the existing FMEA method, such as the weak ability of experts to describe and process fuzzy information and the lack of consideration of the weight and correlation between risk factors. In this paper, by fusing Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFS) and Muirhead Mean (MM) operators, we propose Fermatean fuzzy weighted Muirhead mean (FFWMM) operator and develop a new FMEA method. Firstly, two new risk factors are proposed to overcome the shortcoming of insufficient consideration of the FMEA method. By introducing FFS, the ability of experts to express fuzzy information is enhanced. Using FFWMM operator to aggregate evaluation information can deal with the weight and correlation between influencing factors well. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Weakly supervised semantic segmentation; Spatial correlation-guided
   learning; Self-supervised learning; Multi-view clustering
AB Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) mainly adopts class activation map (CAM) to recognize different categories with generated pseudo masks of only image-level labels. Recently, many advanced works focus on learning the semantic correlation to refine the conventional CAM, which only identify sparse and discriminative semantic regions, severely weakening the further learning ability of spatial features. To copy with the above problem, a spatial correlation-guided learning framework is proposed to exploit the spatial and semantic correlation between adjacent pixels for weakly supervised fine-grained semantic segmentation (WSFGSS). From the spatial perspective, self-supervised multi-view clustering (SMC) is designed to fully mine spatial correlation by clustering of multiple views including scale, angle and position. Moreover, a hybrid self-supervised (HS) loss function is used to further promote the optimized speed and accuracy of three spatial representations. From the semantic perspective, the affinity matrix is applied to describe the semantic similarity between different pixels by building a weighted graph, and combine above robust pseudo label into a probability transition matrix. Therefore, the initial CAM is gradually corrected during the iterative optimization by the random walk algorithm. Finally, the refined CAM is utilized as supervision information for training the standard segmentation network effectively. Sufficient experimental results on BSDS500, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets show that the proposed SMC method obtains more accurate pseudo labels than the recent unsupervised segmentation models. Meantime, with these pseudo labels, the proposed fine-grained framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance for WSFGSS.

AB Probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), whose elements are denoted in probabilistic linguistic term sets, provides a flexible tool for experts to express linguistic preferences in pairwise comparisons of objects. However, missing elements in PLPRs often occur owing to the difficulty of providing pairwise comparison values, especially when the number of objects is large. This study introduces a simplified PLPR based on reference objects, which allows for the incompleteness of probabilistic linguistic term sets when deriving the priorities of objects. We also introduce a consistency measure to check the reliability of a simplified PLPR. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the simplified PLPR in decision making.

AB Existing software product line (SPL) engineering testing approaches generally provide positive testing that validates the SPL's functionality. Negative testing is commonly neglected. This research aims to unify behavioral and feature models of an SPL, enable testing before and after variability binding for domain-centric and product-centric testing, and combine positive and negative testing for a holistic testing view. This study suggests behavioral modeling with event sequence graphs (ESGs). This heterogeneous modeling strategy supports bottom-up domain testing and top-down product testing with the feature model. This new feature-oriented ESG test creation method generates shorter test sequences than the original ESG optimum test sequences. Statechart and original ESG test-generating methods are compared. Positive testing findings are similar. The Statechart technique generated 12 test cases with 59 events, whereas the ESG technique created six test cases with 60 events. The ESG technique generated 205 negative test cases with 858 events with the Test Suite Designer tool. However, the Conformiq Designer tool for the Statechart technique does not have a negative test case generation capability. It is shown that the proposed ESG-based holistic approach confirms not only the desirable (positive) properties but also the undesirable (negative) ones. As an additional research, the traditional ESG test-generating approach is compared to the new feature-oriented method on six SPLs of different sizes and features. Our case study results show that the traditional ESG test generation approach demonstrated higher positive test generation scores compare to the proposed feature-oriented test generation approach. However, our proposed feature-oriented test generation approach is capable of generating shorter test sequences, which could be beneficial for reducing the execution time of test cases compared to traditional ESG approach. Finally, our case study has also shown that regardless of the test generation approach, there has been found no significant difference between the Bottom-up and Top-down test strategies with respect to their positive test generation scores.

AB The surge in data with multiple views has propelled significant interest in the domain of multi-view clustering. Unlike conventional single-view data, multi-view data offers a more accurate representation of objects. However, the pivotal challenge remains in the effective categorization of data through feature extraction from multiple views within clustering tasks. Notably, prevailing multi-view clustering algorithms often emphasize the derivation of appropriate view weights, inadvertently sidestepping optimization intricacies. This approach frequently leads to protracted computational time due to the resource-intensive matrix multiplication operations involved in optimization, coupled with the necessity of weight allocation for diverse views. Addressing this, we propose an optimization framework founded on the optimal transport algorithm that operates independently of view weights. A paramount advantage of the optimal transport algorithm lies in its rapid convergence to a closed-form solution. This study diverges from the conventional focus on view weights and centers on the optimization process within clustering algorithms for resolving multi-view challenges. The introduced framework employing the optimal transport algorithm significantly mitigates computational complexity while handling multiple views. Rigorous experimentation duly substantiates the efficacy of the proposed framework in the realm of multi-view clustering. Across publicly available multi-view datasets, our framework exhibits superior performance over existing state-of-the-art algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper focuses on the multiple radiation source search problems, where the mobile robot identifies the number and parameters of sources online while exploring an unknown environment. The radiation superposition and the limited observations improve the difficulty of estimation, and the exploration trajectory is also associated with estimation. A novel search strategy based on receding horizon planning is proposed, which includes the observation, estimation, and exploration modules. The observation module filters and records the radiation intensity for estimation. In the estimation module, an adaptive differential evolution algorithm is integrated into the peak suppression particle filter to avoid the local optimum. The multi-source radiation gain model is conceived to determine the observation position in the exploration module. The strategy trades off exploration of unknown areas and exploitation of known radiation fields. The results of simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy can identify the parameters and quantities of all sources in multi-modal radiation fields. Furthermore, our strategy exhibits superior performance in searching for multi-radiation sources in unknown environments compared with the boustrophedon path and the Next-Best-View planner.

AB The data generated in the product manufacturing process are usually distributed in different formats, triggering fragmented knowledge and disconnected information. To address this problem, we present a knowledge graph modeling method for the product manufacturing process. First, the concepts of human-cyber-physical (HCP) elements are analyzed in detail. The HCP-related classes, attributes, and relations are defined in a formalized manner in the ontology modeling process. Second, a knowledge graph model for the product manufacturing process (KGM/PMP) is constructed by three steps, including knowledge extraction, knowledge fusion, and knowledge reasoning. When constructing the KGM/PMP model, a deep learning method called BERT-D'BiGRUCRF is presented to automatically extract knowledge from the manufacturing data. Moreover, a set of reasoning rules are designed to infer new knowledge. Finally, a case study is carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The validity of the BERT-D'BiGRU-CRF method on knowledge extraction is verified by comparing performance with four other methods.

AB Preparing the infrastructure for analyzing, recognizing, and characterizing microorganisms in the Metaverse can transform the fields of biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Accordingly, the realization of digital twins of microorganisms, such as viruses, fungi, algae, bacteria, protozoa, archaea, and multicellular animal parasites, can streamline the applicability of the Metaverse and similar emerging technologies like Cyber-Physical Healthcare Systems (CPHS). This is why a new approach to the digital twinning of bacteria has been presented in this research. This method of digital twinning can revolutionize the research and study of bacteria because it allows us to separate useful and harmful bacterial species, increasing the efficiency of treatment noticeably. This innovative method can easily be used by clinics, medical centers, or even by private users physically and virtually and can be adapted to every centralized or decentralized Metaverse Platform. To determine the proper treatment, biologists have always tried to identify the correct bacterial species that prompted a bacterial infection. They use various indicators, such as the bacterial cell's shape and the size of the colony formed by the bacteria, to classify different types of bacteria with different biochemistries and shapes. However, it is challenging because of the extensive similarities between some species. For instance, such similarities exist between Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, which has caused numerous false diagnostic reports by operators. Wrong species reports bring about treatment failure and increase antibiotic resistance issues. Therefore, the digital twins of bacteria cover all of their identifiable characteristics and overcome many limitations to study them. In this approach, DTL techniques, including MobileNetV2, EfficientNetV2-S, and ResNet-50, have been employed to build digital twins of bacteria species. A hybrid dataset was used for training and evaluation. Among the models, EfficientNetV2-S exhibited the best performance, with a validation accuracy of 99.58% and a test accuracy of 99.33%. The results showed the ability of deep learning models to make bacteria digital twins based on image processing from different labs, thus assisting experts in speeding up the process and reducing diagnostic errors. In addition, in the mispredicted cases, the correct species was among the first three choices of the model. Therefore, not only can experts use DTL approaches to speed up the digital twin realization of microorganisms in the Metaverse, but they can also use these methods to reduce diagnostic errors.

ID NEST
AB The existing Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based infrared (IR) and visible (VIS) image fusion methods mainly used multiple discriminators to preserve salient information in source images, which brings difficulty in balancing the performance of these discriminators during training, leading to unideal fused results. To tackle this disadvantage, an image fusion method based on IR compensator and Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) is proposed, called ICWGAN-GP. The generator of ICWGAN-GP employs an adjustment mechanism to obtain more VIS gradients while getting IR intensities, and important details in VIS images are highlighted through the adversarial game between a discriminator and a generator. Using one discriminator allows ICWGAN-GP to focus on learning the feature distribution in a source image, which avoids the balance problem caused by multiple discriminators, and improves the efficiency of the ICWGAN-GP. In addition, an IR compensator based on Quadtree-Bezier method is designed to make up for bright IR features in the fused images. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that ICWGAN-GP can highlight bright target features while generating rich texture in the fused images, and achieves better objective metrics in terms of SCD, CC, FMI_W and VIF than the state-of-the-art methods like U2Fusion, MDLatLRR, DDcGAN, etc. Moreover, in our further fusion tracking experiments, ICWGAN-GP also demonstrates good tracking performance.

   attributes; Node classification
AB Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks(HGNNs), as an effective tool for mining heterogeneous graphs, have achieved remarkable performance on series of real-world applications. Yet, HGNNs are limited in their mining power as they require all nodes to have complete and reliable attributes. It is usually unrealistic since the attributes of many nodes in reality are inevitably missing or noisy. Existing methods usually take imputation schemes to complete missing attributes, in which topology information is ignored, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we study the consistency-based augmentation on heterogeneous graphs, completing the missing attributes and improving original attributes simultaneously, and propose a novel generic architecture-Learning on Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Consistency-based Augmentation(CAHGNN), including random sampling, attribute augmentation and consistency training. In graph augmentation, to ensure attributes sensible and accurate, the attention mechanism is adopted to complete attributes under the guidance of the topological relationship between nodes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CAHGNN over state-of-the-art baselines on semi-supervised node classification.

AB The traditional probabilistic reliability analysis method has problems such as poor convergence, low calculation accuracy, and long time consumption in calculating the reliability of concrete arch bridges due to factors such as the uncertainty of the structural parameters and the performance function being highly nonlinear. This paper proposes a method for calculating the reliability of concrete arch bridges based on the Kriging model and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOSA) of the simulated annealing algorithm. This method takes advantage of the Kriging model in small samples and high-dimensional nonlinear data processing capabilities and establishes a response surface model to approximate the actual limit state function. The optimization of the PSO algorithm is realized through the self-adaptive and variable probability mutation operation of the SA algorithm, which enhances the ability of the PSO algorithm to get rid of the local minimum, effectively avoids falling into the local minimum, and finally makes the calculation result tend to the global optimum. It overcomes the problems of slow convergence speed and premature maturity of traditional PSO algorithms. The correctness and effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper are verified through the example analysis and the actual engineering application of a concrete arch bridge. The research results show that the method proposed in this paper has obvious advantages in sample size, calculation accuracy, and iteration times compared with the existing reliability calculation methods for concrete arch bridges. This paper provides a fast and effective method for the structural reliability calculation of concrete arch bridges.

ID HOPF-BIFURCATION; STABILITY; NEURONS; RING
AB Anatomical experiments have proved that a large number of ring structures exist in neural networks. Therefore, many scholars have focused on modeling and dynamic analysis of multi-ring neural networks. However, most current research regarding multi-ring neural networks considers the case that rings share only one neuron with each other. This type of connection among rings fails to adequately capture the complex structure of actual neural networks. In this paper, we consider two sharing neurons between rings and propose a bicyclic crossed neural network model with multiple time delays. Then, the stability condition of the proposed neural network model is given without time delays. By choosing the sum of time delays as the bifurcation parameter, the occurrence conditions of tipping due to Hopf bifurcation are derived, and the tipping point (bifurcation threshold) is accurately determined. In addition, the explicit formulae for ascertaining the Hopf bifurcation properties are given by utilizing the center manifold theory, which further reveals the evolutionary tipping mechanism. Finally, through numerical simulations, the validity of the theoretical analysis is verified. The results show that with the increase in time delays, the network will gradually lose stability, and the tipping driven by Hopf bifurcation will occur. Moreover, the magnitude of time delays emerges as a significant determinant of both the amplitude and the oscillation period of unstable neurons.

DT Article; Early Access
DE image processing; image representation
AB Region extraction is usually used by many computer vision tasks as a pre-processing step to extract image features. However, how to efficiently extract effective regions remains a challenging problem. In this paper, inspired by the non-symmetry and anti-packing pattern representation model (NAM) and the FatRegion algorithm, a fast NAM-based region extraction algorithm which is called FNRegion is proposed. A NAM-based homogeneous block generation algorithm is first presented to represent an image as a combination of multiple homogeneous blocks, each of which is a square region with visually indistinguishable intra-region colour difference. Then, these homogeneous blocks are merged into larger regions according to their colour and shape information. To group these regions into larger ones in order to progressively build a region tree, a distance function is defined using variety of regional information to measure the distance between adjacent regions. Also, a multi-feature region merging algorithm with linear complexity both in time and space is presented.The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on multiple public datasets in comparison with the state-of-the-art region extraction algorithms. The experimental results show that in the case of almost the same or even less running time as other fast region extraction algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to extract higher-quality regions.

TI Deep Learning-Based Wildfire Image Detection and Classification Systems
   for Controlling Biomass
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
AB Forests are essential natural resources that directly impact the ecosystem. However, the rising frequency of forest fires due to natural and artificial climate change has become a critical issue. A revolutionary municipal application proposes deploying an artificial intelligence-based forest fire warning system to prevent major disasters. This work aims to present an overview of vision-based methods for detecting and categorizing forest fires. The study employs a forest fire detection dataset to address the classification difficulty of discriminating between photos with and without fire. This method is based on convolutional neural network transfer learning with Inception-v3. Thus, automatic identification of current forest fires (including burning biomass) is a critical field of research for reducing negative repercussions. Early fire detection can also assist decision-makers in developing mitigation and extinguishment strategies. Radial basis function Networks (RBFNs) with rapid and accurate image super resolution (RAISR) is a deep learning framework trained on an input dataset to detect active fires and burning biomass. The proposed RBFN-RAISR model's performance in recognizing fires and nonfires was compared to earlier CNN models using several performance criteria. The water wave optimization technique is used for image feature selection, noise and blurring reduction, image improvement and restoration, and image enhancement and restoration. When classifying fire and no-fire photos, the proposed RBFN-RAISR fire detection approach achieves 97.55% accuracy, 93.33% F-Score, 96.44% recall, 94.19% precision, and an error rate of 24.89. Given the one-of-a-kind forest fire detection dataset, the suggested method achieves promising results for the forest fire categorization problem.

TI TriangleNet: Edge Prior Augmented Network for Semantic Segmentation

ID DEPTH ESTIMATION
AB This paper addresses the task of semantic segmentation in computer vision, aiming to achieve precise pixel-wise classification. We investigate the joint training of models for semantic edge detection and semantic segmentation, which has shown a promise. However, implicit cross-task consistency learning in multitask networks is limited. To address this, we propose a novel "decoupled cross-task consistency loss" that explicitly enhances cross-task consistency. Our semantic segmentation network, TriangleNet, achieves a substantial 2.88% improvement over the Baseline in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the Cityscapes test set. Notably, TriangleNet operates at 77.4% mIoU/46.2 FPS on Cityscapes, showcasing real-time inference capabilities at full resolution. With multiscale inference, performance is further enhanced to 77.8%. Furthermore, TriangleNet consistently outperforms the Baseline on the FloodNet dataset, demonstrating its robust generalization capabilities. The proposed method underscores the significance of multitask learning and explicit cross-task consistency enhancement for advancing semantic segmentation and highlights the potential of multitasking in real-time semantic segmentation.

AB We propose a framework to directly estimate the gradient in multivariate nonparametric regression models that bypasses fitting the regression function. Specifically, we construct the estimator as a linear combination of adjacent observations with the coefficients from a vector-valued difference sequence, so it is more flexible than existing methods. Under the equidistant designs, closed-form solutions of the optimal sequences are derived by minimizing the estimation variance, with the estimation bias well controlled. We derive the theoretical properties of the estimators and show that they achieve the optimal convergence rate. Further, we propose a data-driven tuning parameter-selection criterion for practical implementation. The effectiveness of our estimators is validated via simulation studies and a real data application.

The design specifications can be taken as typical benchmark specifications targeted at testing as well as validating the effectiveness of various newly developed algorithms for designing various typical variable filters (VFs). Then, the paper provides a novel unity-bounded (UB) function developed for ensuring the stability of those VFs with recursive structures. Finally, a wide variety of simulation results are included for validating the design performance as well as the assured stability by using both the benchmark design specifications and the novel UB function.

DE Tabita Rezaire; Decolonization; AI; Captive maternal; Care; Critical
   race theory; Aesthetics
AB Much more than their machinic reality, current iterations of AI rely on imagined divisions of human and non-human properties and skills that have genealogical ties to colonization. For this reason, research efforts have recently been made to historicize these imaginaries, connecting them to colonial ideals that delegate black and brown colonized people into the realm of the non-human. Atanasoski and Vora (Surrogate humanity. Race, robots and the politics of technological futures, Duke, Durham and London, 2019) have called this a "surrogate humanity", where narratives of autonomous technologies function to disappear precisely the formerly colonized peoples that are enveloped in its production process. At the same time, the gendered and racialized roots of this maternal figure represents an opportunity to uncover and critique the invisibilization of embodied resources necessary to produce AI, precarious bodies labouring to produce algorithmic infrastructures in a manner that can be considered in a genealogy of carework and reproduction. These genealogies complicate the detachment suggested by the surrogate figure and go beyond it to proclaim a more generative function of the relationship between the black maternal figure and AI. The article analyses Tabita Rezaire's multi-media artwork Sugar Walls Teardom to think through decolonial and queer renderings of the black female bodies upon which technological imaginaries rest, to extend beyond AI surrogacy and towards notions of kinship, care and world-making by producing an AI aesthetics that is relational, embodied, and celebratory of other ways of liveness.

   artificial intelligence
SO AI & SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article; Early Access
DE Artificial intelligence; Art history; Coloniality; Decolonial
   aesthetics; Algorithmic art; Data feminism
AB This paper considers recent experiments in art and artificial intelligence that crystallize around training algorithms to generate artworks based on datasets derived from the Western art historical canon. Over the last decade, a shift towards the rejection of canonicity has begun to take shape in art historical discourse. At the same time, algorithmically enabled practices in the US and Europe have emerged that entrench the Western canon as a locus and guarantor of aesthetic value. Operating within the epistemic framework of a "view from nowhere," this tendency in generative art inherits the coloniality of both art history and artificial intelligence. Producing "art histories from nowhere," this tendency conflates the conceptual category of visual art with the histories of Western cultural production. It reproduces a set of aesthetic values that entrench the mythology of the artist-genius and his imputed whiteness and masculinity; the extolment of innovation and novelty as self-evident virtues; disembodied Cartesian models of knowing and sensing; and the erasure of contributions that have been occluded from canonical visibility. As we encounter systems trained on particular visions of art history and of the artist, how might we remain attentive to the specific lens through which they are taught to see? This essay addresses that question by bringing the coloniality of recent experiments into view, bridging data feminisms and decolonial studies to formulate alternative visions of encounters between art and AI.

AB Most mediation systems use a caching policy in order to overcome their performance challenges. One of the most widely adopted strategies is known as semantic caching. Semantic caches are called so because they store the descriptions of all submitted queries. Although they may seem to be based on semantics because of their name, this is not really the case. In fact, they actually compare the syntax of the cached queries to the syntax of the new query to retrieve responses from the cache. This can lead to significant delays, especially if multiple requests are stored in the cache. In this work, we propose a new semantic approach based on ontologies to compute the semantic similarity between two given queries, and we provide also a new algorithm to filter all regions of the cache that do not semantically cover a user query. In this way, the use of the cache would be optimal and fast at the same time, despite the large number of regions in the cache. In fact, only the most beneficial regions will be processed to retrieve data from the cache.

AB Using restriction levels and interval type-2 fuzzy sets into linguistic summarization evaluation is a novel strategy presented in this paper. The uncertainty and ambiguity in the linguistic summaries are handled by the suggested method by using interval type 2 fuzzy sets. While it complies with the requirements that evaluation methods should meet, the suggested method additionally makes use of restriction levels to offer a more reliable evaluation framework. On the basis of real-world data, the proposed method's efficacy is shown. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach can offer a thorough and precise evaluation of the linguistic summary techniques. The suggested method can assist practitioners and researchers in evaluating linguistic summaries results in a simple yet consistent fashion.

AB The most efficient technique that is used for aircraft engine tuning is through mounting the engine on the engine test bench (ETB) to analyze, tune and monitor its variables through the ETB run. It is practically very difficult to unmount the engine from the aircraft and mount it on the ETB for analyzing and estimating a single variable such as fuel consumption or oil temperature as the unmounting process requires huge manpower and machinery. This problem can be resolved if the fuel consumption of an air vehicle is estimated without unmounting the engine from the aircraft through applying data analytics and machine learning models. Therefore, in this paper, the fuel consumption of an aircraft is analyzed and estimated through advanced data science techniques. The dataset went through data analyzing and preprocessing techniques before applying multiple machine learning models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression, decision tree regression and deep learning algorithm RNN/LSTM. The performance of algorithms has been evaluated using model evaluation methods such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination. The models are evaluated in taxi, cruise and approach flight phases where the LSTM performs excellent among all other algorithms with RMSE 15.1%, 10.5% and 0.9%, respectively.

AB The index tracking problem consists of constructing a portfolio that has the closest performance of a given index as possible, with fewer assets in its composition. When considering a large number of assets, including all of them on the solution may incur high transaction fees, harming the accumulated returns in the long term. The constraint that limits the portfolio size imposes a combinatorial nature on the problem and the computation of the optimal solution becomes infeasible as the universe of assets grows. To get around this issue, pure and hybrid metaheuristics have been proposed in the literature to achieve good solutions in practical time. Different from pure metaheuristics, hybrid metaheuristics do not need any constraint handling or solution repairing approaches since they often use general-purpose solvers to adjust portfolio weights. This work presents a comparison between pure and hybrid genetic algorithms, which is one of the most popular heuristics applied in the portfolio selection field. We considered linear and nonlinear index tracking models in the experiments, where the GA that obtained the best performance in a single period optimization strategy, was selected to backtest in a dynamic index tracking approach. The results showed that hybrid GAs can compute good or even better solutions than the CPLEX solver and pure GAs, in a shorter time.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Confusion region mining module (CRM); crowd counting; guided erasing
   module (GEM)
AB Existing works mainly focus on crowd and ignore the confusion regions which contain extremely similar appearance to crowd in the background, while crowd counting needs to face these two sides at the same time. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable confusion region discriminating and erasing network called CDENet. Specifically, CDENet is composed of two modules of confusion region mining module (CRM) and guided erasing module (GEM). CRM consists of basic density estimation (BDE) network, confusion region aware bridge and confusion region discriminating network. The BDE network first generates a primary density map, and then the confusion region aware bridge excavates the confusion regions by comparing the primary prediction result with the ground-truth density map. Finally, the confusion region discriminating network learns the difference of feature representations in confusion regions and crowds. Furthermore, GEM gives the refined density map by erasing the confusion regions. We evaluate the proposed method on four crowd counting benchmarks, including ShanghaiTech Part_A, ShanghaiTech Part_B, UCF_CC_50, and UCF-QNRF, and our CDENet achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-arts.

AB Semi-supervised node classification is an important task that aims at classifying nodes based on the graph structure, node features, and class labels for a subset of nodes. While most graph convolutional networks (GCNs) perform well when an ample number of labeled nodes are available, they often degenerate when the amount of labeled data is limited. To address this problem, we propose a scheme, namely, Individuality-enhanced and Multi-granularity Consistency-preserving graph neural Network (IMCN), which can alleviate the problem of losing individual information within the encoder while providing a reliable supervised signal for learning purposes. First, one simple encoder based on node features only is integrated to enhance node individuality and amend node commonality learned by the GCN-based encoder. Then, three constraints are defined at different levels of granularity, encompassing node embedding agreement, semantic class alignment, and node-to-class distribution identity. They can maintain the consistency between the individuality and commonality of nodes and be leveraged as latent supervised signals for learning representative embeddings. Finally, the trade-off between the individuality and commonality of nodes captured by two encoders is taken into consideration for node classification. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets have been conducted to validate the superiority of IMCN against state-of-the-art baselines in handling node classification tasks with scarce labeled data.

ID MODEL
AB Stock price forecasting is important for financial risk management and investment decisions. However, traditional forecasting techniques are challenged and under pressure due to the complex characteristics of stock prices and the impact of quantitative trading. Therefore, to address these issues and produce a more accurate stock price forecasting method, this study proposes a two-stage deep integration paradigm based on optimal multi-scale decomposition and multi-factor analysis. This paradigm will also serve as a scientific support and reference for investors' actual investment decisions. (1) Optimal multi-scale decomposition methods are proposed to achieve decomposition of the closing price. Noise suppression and optimal decomposition modes are achieved by singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and variable mode decomposition (VMD) to reconstruct the high- and low-frequency sub-series. (2) The approximate entropy is used to measure the complexity of the time series, and the approximate entropy of the decomposed sequence is judged to reconstruct the characteristic subsequence. (3) The multi-factor analysis method uses a joint feature selection technique, the spearman correlation coefficient test, and the mutual information (MI) index to find the optimal feature influence factor and extract the optimal influence factor using feature compression. (4) Two-stage deep integration was performed using bidirectional gate recurrent unit (BIGRU) to obtain the final predictions. The two major indices of the Chinese A-share market, namely the Shenzhen Stock Index (SZI) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSEC), with data sourced from the Flush Finance website, were used to verify the validity of the model proposed in this paper. The MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values of the proposed model in this paper are 171.1673, 221.2086, and 1.2796% in SZI market and 29.9973, 39.3508, and 0.8946% in SSEC market, respectively, which are significantly better than other comparative models. Based on the experiments, it can be seen that the optimal multi-scale decomposition method performs better in capturing the hidden information of the original data, while the multi-factor analysis provides more relevant data for the prediction, which helps to improve the accuracy of the prediction. After integrating the predictions, the decomposition-integrated hybrid model proposed in this paper predicts significantly better than with other prediction models.

ID NETWORKS; ROBUST
AB Siamese-based trackers have been widely studied for their high accuracy and speed. Both the feature extraction and feature fusion are two important components in Siamese-based trackers. Siamese-based trackers obtain fine local features by traditional convolution. However, some important channel information and global information are lost when enhancing local features. In the feature fusion process, cross-correlation-based feature fusion between the template and search region feature ignores the global spatial context information and does not make the best of the spatial information. In this paper, to solve the above problem, we design a novel feature extraction sub-network based on batch-free normalization re-parameterization convolution, which scales the features in the channel dimension and increases the receptive field. Richer channel information is obtained and powerful target features are extracted for the feature fusion. Furthermore, we learn a feature fusion network (FFN) based on feature filter. The FFN fuses the template and search region features in a global spatial context to obtain high-quality fused features by enhancing important features and filtering redundant features. By jointly learning the proposed feature extraction sub-network and FFN, the local and global information are fully exploited. Then, we propose a novel tracking algorithm based on the designed feature extraction sub-network and FFN with re-parameterization convolution and feature filter, referred to as RCFT. We evaluate the proposed RCFT tracker and some recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers on OTB100, VOT2018, LaSOT, GOT-10k, UAV123 and the visual-thermal dataset VOT-RGBT2019 datasets, which achieves superior tracking performance with 45 FPS tracking speed.

TI CLIP-Adapter: Better Vision-Language Models with Feature Adapters
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION

DT Article; Early Access
DE Feature adapter; Vision-language model; Few-shot learning;
   Open-vocabulary
AB Large-scale contrastive vision-language pretraining has shown significant progress in visual representation learning. Unlike traditional visual systems trained by a fixed set of discrete labels, a new paradigm was introduced in Radford et al. (International conference on machine learning, PMLR, 2021) to directly learn to align images with raw texts in an open-vocabulary setting. On downstream tasks, a carefully chosen text prompt is employed to make zero-shot predictions. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, context optimization (Zhou et al. in Int J Comput Vis 130(9):2337-2348, 2022) has been proposed to learn continuous vectors as task-specific prompts with few-shot training examples. In this paper, we show that there is an alternative path to achieve better vision-language models other than prompt tuning. While prompt tuning is for the textual inputs, we propose CLIP-Adapter to conduct fine-tuning with feature adapters on either visual or language branch. Specifically, CLIP-Adapter adopts an additional bottleneck layer to learn new features and performs residual-style feature blending with the original pretrained features. As a consequence, CLIP-Adapter is able to outperform context optimization while maintaining a simple design. Experiments and extensive ablation studies on various visual classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Aiming at the carrier landing control problem of the fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with model uncertainties and external disturbances, a discrete-time fuzzy flight control (DFFC) strategy is proposed to improve the flight performance by utilizing a discrete-time disturbance observer (DTDO) and the prescribed performance control (PPC) method in this paper. Firstly, the continuous time system model with uncertainties and disturbances is transformed into a discrete-time model by Euler approximation method and then the model uncertainties are approximated by the fuzzy logic system (FLS). Then, a DTDO based on the FLS is designed to estimate and compensate the disturbances caused by the deck motion and airwake, and the DFFC method is developed with the assistance of the discrete-time dynamic surface control and the PPC method. Notably, the designed DTDO by introducing FLS further improves the robustness of the system. Preciously, the application of the PPC ensures that the UAV can track the reference glide trajectory within the specified performance range. At last, the stability of the system is proved by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness and supremacy of the DFFC are illustrated via the simulation comparison and analysis.

ID CONSISTENCY; AGGREGATION
AB Considering the conflicting opinions and different risk attitudes among decision-makers (DMs) in group decision making (GDM), this paper develops a novel compatibility model with additive trapezoidal fuzzy environment based on continuous ordered weighted averaging (COWA) operator to handle the conflicts. First, some concepts of COWA operator-based compatibility index and characteristic preference relation for additive trapezoidal fuzzy preference relation (ATFPR) are discussed. Then a compatibility reaching algorithm is designed to assist each ATFPR in achieving acceptable compatibility. Moreover, the expert weight optimization model based on the criterion of minimum compatibility of preference relation in GDM is established. Furthermore, a GDM process based on compatibility measures with ATFPRs is introduced, and an application of the proposed approach is put forward. The novelties of our approach are that: (1) COWA operator can deal with the compatibility of all arguments by using controlled parameters that consider the risk attitudes of DMs rather than the compatibility of the simply two points in intervals; (2) compatibility improving algorithm makes sure that the original opinions are retained as much as possible because only one pair of preference relation elements are revised in each round; (3) optimal weights model ensures that weights of DMs in group aggregation are determined availably.

AB In recent times, there has been tremendous growth in the number of multi-lingual users on social media platforms. Consequently, the code-mixing phenomenon, i.e., mixing of more than one language, has become ubiquitous in Internet content. In this paper, we present a shared-private, multi-lingual, multi-task model coupled with a transformer-based pre-trained encoder for sentiment analysis of code-mixed and English languages. Our model is tailored for multitasking that transfers the knowledge between code-mixed and English sentiment tasks. We consider code-mixed sentiment analysis as the primary task and enhance its performance by English sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) by sharing knowledge between them. We fine-tune the Bidirectional Encoder Representation using Transformer (BERT) encoder in a shared-private fashion to obtain the shared and task-specific features using the multi-task objective function. We evaluate our proposed framework using three benchmark datasets for the Hindi-English (Hinglish), Punjabi-English (Punglish) code-mixed and English sentiment tasks. Experiment results justify that our proposed multi-task framework improves the performance of our primary task in comparison to the state-of-art single-task systems.

AB At present, there are few studies on the delayed kernel function of hyper-strong kernel. This paper attempts to analyze the stability and bifurcation of neural networks with distributed delayed hyper-strong kernels. Firstly, considering the average delay as a bifurcation parameter, the study discusses the characteristic equations of delayed kernels with weak kernel, strong kernel and hyper-strong kernel to provide sufficient conditions for the stability and generation of Hopf bifurcation. Secondly, it applies the normal theory and the center manifold theory to derive the formulas for determining the stability and direction of the bifurcating periodic solution. Finally, it verifies the correctness of the calculation results by numerical simulation with an example.

AB The selection of subcontractors is a significant aspect of any project since it can have a meaningful impact on the success of the project. In other words, choosing the wrong subcontractor can lead to delays and cost overruns. Thus, selecting the best subcontractors is crucial for every general contractor. In this study, imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is presented to solve the subcontractor selection problem (SSP) in multiple project environments by minimizing the general contractor's cost as the objective subject to resource and precedence constraints under two different circumstances. In the first circumstance, the project deadline can be postponed by paying a penalty; while the deadline cannot be deferred in the second one. The random key (RK) and the subcontractor list representation schemes are employed as encoding procedures, and the serial schedule generation scheme (SSGS) is utilized as a decoding scheme. Comparing the results of applying the presented ICA in a case study with the results obtained using an exact method and genetic algorithm (GA) validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve SSP in multiple project environments. The outcomes demonstrate that the proposed ICA is more efficient in cases where the project deadline is restricted.

AB Product development projects usually contain many interrelated activities with complex information dependences, which induce activity rework, project delay and cost overrun. To reduce negative impacts, scheduling interrelated activities in an appropriate sequence is an important issue for project managers. This study develops a double-decomposition based parallel branch-and-prune algorithm, to determine the optimal activity sequence that minimizes the total feedback length (FLMP). This algorithm decomposes FLMP from two perspectives, which enables the use of all available computing resources to solve subproblems concurrently. In addition, we propose a result-compression strategy and a hash-address strategy to enhance this algorithm. Experimental results indicate that our algorithm can find the optimal sequence for FLMP up to 27 activities within 1 h, and outperforms state of the art exact algorithms.

AB Using a loss function with appropriate properties to supervise the training of the neural network can substantially improve its accuracy and speed. A majority of loss functions applied to landmark detection, including Smooth l1 loss, Wing loss and Adaptive Wing loss, utilize a form of piece-wise function to enhance the loss value of small errors. Still, some issues arise with these functions, such as non-differentiable, sensitivity to the outliers and additional computation to guarantee the continuity of the functions. In this paper, we propose a unified loss function called Adaptive Robust loss (ARobust loss) that is tailored for two landmark detection paradigms, i.e., coordinate regression and heatmap regression. In addition, we demonstrate the robustness, smoothness and continuity of the proposed loss function towards the two paradigms analytically. Last but not least, we validate the preeminence and accuracy of the adaptive robust loss on several landmark detection datasets by experiments. The best NME(%) results under the HRNet-W18 reached 4.52 (WFLW-Test) and 3.34 (300W-Full), respectively. In the standard task of face alignment and human pose estimation, the performance of our approach is on par with the SOTA losses. And the advantage of our proposed loss is more obvious in some challenging scenarios.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) offers opportunities but also challenges for biomedical research and healthcare. This position paper shares the results of the international conference "Fair medicine and AI" (online 3-5 March 2021). Scholars from science and technology studies (STS), gender studies, and ethics of science and technology formulated opportunities, challenges, and research and development desiderata for AI in healthcare. AI systems and solutions, which are being rapidly developed and applied, may have undesirable and unintended consequences including the risk of perpetuating health inequalities for marginalized groups. Socially robust development and implications of AI in healthcare require urgent investigation. There is a particular dearth of studies in human-AI interaction and how this may best be configured to dependably deliver safe, effective and equitable healthcare. To address these challenges, we need to establish diverse and interdisciplinary teams equipped to develop and apply medical AI in a fair, accountable and transparent manner. We formulate the importance of including social science perspectives in the development of intersectionally beneficent and equitable AI for biomedical research and healthcare, in part by strengthening AI health evaluation.

ID CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS; PREFERENCE RELATIONS; MODEL; DERIVATION; NUMBERS
AB Best-worst method (BWM) is an efficient multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) method. This paper puts forward two decision-making methods with intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) BWM (IF-BWM). Firstly, a new consistency definition of IF-BWM is presented. To comprehensive reflect the consistency level of original IF preference comparisons, an acceptable input-and-output-based consistency ratio (CR) of IF-BWM preference comparisons is defined to measure the consistency level of IF-BWM preference comparisons. A goal linear programming model is built to improve the consistency level of input-based CR from the original IF-BWM preference comparisons. To induce an optimal multiplicative normalized IF weight vector (IFWV), a programming model is set up. Accordingly, a novel individual IF-BWM is proposed. Using the deviation between IF values, an analytic expression of determining experts' weights is formulated. By minimizing the weighted deviation between individual multiplicative normalized IFWVs and group multiplicative normalized IFWV, a programming model is built to determine the optimal group multiplicative normalized IFWV. Subsequently, a novel group IF-BWM is put forward. Two real-life examples are furnished to reveal the validity of proposed individual IF-BWM and group IF-BWM in practice. In view of theoretical aspect, this paper fosters the theory of IF-BWM by firstly proposing an input-based CR, output-based CR, an acceptable input-and-output-based CR and group IF-BWM. The model of improving CR of IF-BWM preference comparisons is initially discussed. This paper has a certain guiding significance for the following research on IF-BWM and provides a novel perspective for an MADM problem with positive and negative preference information.

AB Stock price forecasting has been always a difficult and crucial undertaking in the field of finance. In the last few decades, deep learning models based on RNNs and LSTMs have dominated the research, where the stock price data are modeled as time series data. However, the high volatility of stock prices and the decay of information learned from historical data prevented these models from achieving more accurate predictions in this problem. Recently, Transformer has been gradually applied in time series prediction, but the methods aim to feed the highly-uncertain social media information as the additional auxiliary information into Transformer, rather than improving the ability to extract features from historical series. In this paper, we propose a Series Decomposition Transformer with Period-correlation (SDTP), which uses the period-correlation mechanism and series decomposition layers to further discover relation between historical series and learn the changing trends in the stock market for high forecasting accuracy and generalizability. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed SDTP model generally outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on a collection of datasets.

ID IMAGE SEGMENTATION
AB Image segmentation of polyps can provide an important basis for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and has a high clinical application value. Segmentation of polyp regions is very challenging due to the high similarity between polyps and background mucosal tissue, many existing methods have failed to produce satisfactory polyp segmentation results. Therefore, scholars have recently used transformer backbone networks to extract features, which captures global information better than CNNs, resulting in more accurate detection results, but their boundary results are still not accurate enough due to the lack of processing for the boundary. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale perceptual polyp segmentation network based on boundary guidance, to obtain higher segmentation accuracy in both regions and boundary. To increase the feature response region, we first propose a multi-scale global perception module to expand the receptive field and aggregate multi-scale contextual information to capture the primary location of polyps at local and global levels. Then, we design a boundary-guided feature enhancement module that utilizes contextual features to mine hidden polyp boundary and employs the boundary to guide region learning to improve segmentation boundary accuracy. Finally, we propose a complementary fusion module that uses higher-level features to filter out the background noise of lower-level features and fuses the features layer by layer. In particular, to refine the extracted features, a detail refinement module is designed to complement the spatial details to improve the segmentation performance. Extensive experiments using seven evaluation metrics on five publicly available polyp datasets have shown that the proposed a multi-scale perceptual polyp segmentation network based on boundary guidance outperforms most state-of-theart models.

AB Ensuring the safety and security of crowded places is a major concern for both the government and the public. Accurately and quickly estimating the number of people in a crowd is crucial for public safety, urban planning, and traffic monitoring. The existing methods have a minimum mean square error of 0.89 and require high storage space, making them inappropriate for crowd counting using low-computation and small-storage devices like single-board computers. Furthermore, these methods suffer from prediction time lag and are not suitable for live streaming. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a Deep Convolution Neural Network-based 'CrowdDCNN' model for crowd counting. This model reduces the value of mean square error by 0.29 and the size of the model by 80.01%. Additionally, the prediction time was decreased to 700 ms. Further, the 'NoLag' algorithm introduced in this paper is efficient in live crowd counting. Its O(1) time and space complexity make it appropriate for all devices, including single-board computers, laptops, and GPUs. The reported 0-p value during statistical analysis using Wilcoxon test, Friedman rank test, and paired t-test validates the superiority of the proposed model.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) is a simple yet efficient Neural Architecture Search (NAS) method. During the search stage, DARTS trains a supernet by jointly optimizing architecture parameters and network parameters. During the evaluation stage, DARTS discretizes the supernet to derive the optimal architecture based on architecture parameters. However, recent research has shown that during the training process, the supernet tends to converge towards sharp minima rather than flat minima. This is evidenced by the higher sharpness of the loss landscape of the supernet, which ultimately leads to a performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. In this paper, we propose Self-Distillation Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (SD-DARTS) to alleviate the discretization gap. We utilize self-distillation to distill knowledge from previous steps of the supernet to guide its training in the current step, effectively reducing the sharpness of the supernet's loss and bridging the performance gap between the supernet and the optimal architecture. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of voting teachers, where multiple previous supernets are selected as teachers, and their output probabilities are aggregated through voting to obtain the final teacher prediction. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the advantages of our novel self-distillation-based NAS method compared to state-of-the-art alternatives. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Time series averaging is one of the essential subroutines in time series analysis. DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA) has proven to be an effective and popular DTW-based time series averaging algorithm. However, DBA lacks the ability to average time series in the time domain, making it sensitive to initialization. In this research, we propose a novel shape-based time series averaging algorithm, called Shape DTW Weighted Averaging (ShapeDWA), to address the shortcomings of DBA. The proposed ShapeDWA algorithm combines the advantages of the DBA and the Cubic-spline DTW (CDTW) averaging methods. The concepts of time index averaging and re-sampling in the CDTW algorithm are incorporated into the DBA algorithm, giving ShapeDWA the ability to average a set of time series in both the amplitude and time domains. Moreover, ShapeDWA utilizes a weighed average instead of the barycenter average in DBA, which effectively attenuate the effects of noise, outliers, and local amplitude differences between the time series. To qualitatively evaluate and compare the proposed time series averaging algorithm, two metrics have been developed: average discrepancy distance and average time distortion. Extensive experimental results on the UCR time series database illustrate the superior performance of ShapeDWA over DBA and SSG, with an average reduction of 23.42% and 24.89% for average discrepancy distance, and 18.76% and 19.81% for average time distortion. Furthermore, the template matching-based classification experiment shows that ShapeDWA combined with these two developed metrics improves the classification rate by 17.07% and 16.42% compared to DBA and SSG, respectively.

AB This article focuses on the neural adaptive output feedback control study related to nonaffine stochastic multiple-input, multiple-output nonlinear plants. First, a K-filter state observer based on a radial basis function neural network is designed to estimate the remaining unavailable states. Then, a novel adaptive command-filtered backstepping output feedback control framework is established, where an improved command filter with a fractional-order parameter is applied to conquer the calculation size problem. Specifically, the highlight of this work is that it designs a modified error compensation signal and incorporates the concept of deferred constraint to eradicate the negative effect caused by the filter errors. In addition, the network bandwidth resources, control impulse, and control accuracy are synthesized using an amended switching event-triggered mechanism. The theoretical analysis proved that the proposed control approach guarantees that the tracking error can converge to a preassigned region within a user-defined time while the violation of the deferred output constraint can be excluded. Two illustrative studies are provided to demonstrate the validity and superiority of the developed control method.

   Information disentanglement; Sparse structure
AB Unlike current state-of-the-art methods based on data augmentation and adversarial frameworks to solve the fair classification problem, this paper proposes the Information Bottleneck Disentanglement Based Sparse Representation algorithm to ensure the fairness of extracted features. The algorithm assumes that each sample is collaboratively generated by a categorical latent variable and a sensitive or category-irrelevant latent variable. To ensure that these two latent variables correctly capture their corresponding features, we impose Information Bottleneck Disentanglement constraints on them. Specifically, the Information Bottleneck is used to obtain more relevant information while compressing the amount of information. Simultaneously, a mutual information minimization constraint enhances their independence. Additionally, by employing the sparse structure, we can further disentangle the discriminative and sensitive information under supervision guidance. Therefore, the algorithm can improve the discrimination of the categorical latent variable as much as possible without extracting the sensitive data into it. Extensive experiments on five public and challenging benchmark datasets reveal the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating that it can ensure fairness without sacrificing classification performance.

However, this method requires a large number of labeled datasets for network training, and it cannot detect new types of defects randomly generated in the actual production process, making it difficult to transfer to actual production. To address this problem, we propose a structural information awareness network (SIA-Net). It is constructed by the adaptive generative adjunctive network (AGAN) module, which can simulate the background style of defect-free samples to randomly embed more reasonable defects. Then, the model is trained to recover the defect embedded area and the defect area is inferred according to the difference between before and after image restoration. Furthermore, in order to avoid blurring the image structure information during feature extraction, the self-attention encoder (SE) and spatial awareness decoder (SD) modules are designed to aggregate the image structure information to generate the final prediction results. We selected four public datasets and specially developed a box defect dataset to verify its detection effect. Experimental results (mIoU/mPA) (Kolektor: 88.91%/89.55%, AITEX defect: 89.61%/ 91.46%, RSDDs: 86.89%/87.88%, MT defect: 88.36%/90.32%, box defect: 89.71%/90.57%) show that our proposed method clearly outperforms the current unsupervised detection methods.

AB Centralized and decentralized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms rely on networked communication to exchange information among individuals and generate cooperative behaviors. This study proposes an Information-Fusion based Decentralized Swarm Decision Algorithm (IFDSDA) to coordinate UAV swarms when communication is interfered with or fails. Each UAV has the ability to perceive the area ahead using a monocular camera. An information fusion strategy is presented to unify the two types of information obtained from communication and visual perception in a standardized manner. This mechanism enables UAVs to fully utilize different information in cases of communication failure. Each UAV is controlled by a decentralized swarm decision module that takes the fused information as inputs and generates the heading orientation by combining basic action rules of UAVs. The weight parameters of the combination are optimized using the heuristic genetic algorithm in an offline manner. The collision/obstacle avoidance and area search missions are used as test scenarios for the proposed IFDSDA. Simulations with high confidence are conducted, which demonstrate the effectiveness, inherent scalability, and robustness of the proposed method, comparing it with the state-of-the-art ISOA method and its variant. This study reduces the dependence on network communication within the swarm and improves the adaptability of UAV swarms in complex battlefield environments.

AB This article develops a new edge removal mechanism for the global stabilizability of Boolean networks (BNs). In order to achieve the edge removal control, several control variables are properly placed into the dynamics of BNs based on the fundamental logical operators. On the basis of the new edge removal mechanism, several necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the global stabilizability and set stabilizability of BNs. Furthermore, a kind of stable edge removal control is proposed and achieved via the Q-learning algorithm to optimize the edge removal mechanism. As an application, the edge removal control is used to verify whether or not the mammalian cortical area development model can be made stabilizable to the expected stable states.

AB During and after Hurricane Maria in 2017, the island of Puerto Rico faced an impossible situation: the transportation, power, and communication networks were all damaged, leading to numerous people being trapped. Humanitarian logistics service providers have the responsibility to reach as many affected populations as possible within short periods of time. Their extremely difficult operations are further hindered by these failures in our built environment. Failures in transportation mean that some routes cannot be used by conventional ground vehicles; failures in communication mean that demands are uncertain, and the locations of said demands may be difficult to pinpoint. In this work, we propose a novel two-echelon vehicle routing framework for performing many of the humanitarian logistics operations using aerial uncrewed autonomous vehicles (drones) to address the issues associated with these infrastructure failures. In our proposed framework, we assume that ground vehicles cannot always reach the trapped population directly, but they can transport drones from a depot to some intermediate satellite locations. The drones launched from these locations can serve to both identify demands for medical and other aids (e.g., epi-pens, medical supplies, dry food, water) and make deliveries to satisfy them. Specifically, we present an expert decision support system, in which the resulting optimization problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem with trucks as the first echelon vehicles and drones as the second echelon vehicles. Our framework utilizes two types of drones. Hotspot or communication providing drones have the capability of providing cell phone and internet reception, and hence, are used to capture demands and their locations. Delivery drones are subsequently employed to satisfy these obtained demands. To handle demand uncertainty, we decompose the decision problem into two stages: providing telecommunications capabilities in the first stage, thereby capturing demands precisely, and satisfying the resulting demands in the second stage. To solve the resulting models, we propose a matheuristic computational approach in the form of a decomposition algorithm inspired by column generation to identify optimal drone routes. To showcase the application of our proposed framework, we present results from numerical experiments on datasets created to simulate the demand for medical aid in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

AB Random forest is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms. Decision trees used to construct the random forest may have low classification accuracies or high correlations, which affects the comprehensive performance of the random forest. Aiming at these problems, the authors proposed an improved random forest based on the classification accuracy and correlation measurement of decision trees in this paper. Its main idea includes two parts, one is retaining the classification and regression trees (CARTs) with better classification effects, the other is reducing the correlations between the CARTs. Specifically, in the classification effect evaluation part, each CART was applied to make predictions on three reserved data sets, then the average classifi-cation accuracies were achieved, respectively. Thus, all the CARTs were sorted in descending order according to their achieved average classification accuracies. In the correlation measurement part, the improved dot product method was proposed to calculate the cosine similarity, i.e., the correlation, between CARTs in the feature space. By using the achieved average classification accuracy as reference, the grid search method was used to find the inner product threshold. On this basis, the CARTs with low average classification accuracy among CART pairs whose inner product values are higher than the inner product threshold were marked as deletable. The achieved average classification accuracies and correlations of CARTs were comprehensively considered, those with high correlation and weak classification effect were deleted, and those with better quality were retained to construct the random forest. Multiple experiments show that, the proposed improved random forest achieved higher average classification accuracy than the five random forests used for comparison, and the lead was stable. The G-means and out-of-bag data (OBD) score obtained by the proposed improved random forest were also higher than the five random forests, and the lead was more obvious. In addition, the test results of three non-parametric tests show that, there were significant diversities between the proposed improved random forest and the other five random forests. This effectively proves the superiority and practicability of the proposed improved random forest.

AB Road extraction from remote sensing images is very important in navigation, urban planning, traffic manage-ment and other fields. Deep learning methods have achieved great success in computer vision tasks. Therefore, road extraction from remote sensing images using deep learning methods can significantly improve the road extraction accuracy. However, these methods generally have problems such as low road extraction accuracy, slow training speed, high computational complexity, and poor road topology connectivity. In order to solve the above issues, we propose a Swin-ResUNet+ structure and use the new paradigm Swin-Transformer to extract roads in remote sensing images. Specifically, we construct an Edge Enhancement module based on residual connection and add this module to each stage of the encoder, which can obtain the edge information in remote sensing images. Based on the Edge Enhancement module, we propose a Swin-ResUNet+ structure in order to better capture the topology of roads. On the Massachusetts road dataset, our model has the least computational cost with only less than one percent accuracy decrease. On the DeepGlobe2018 road dataset, our model not only has the least computational complexity but also achieves the highest values of mIOU, mDC, mPA and F1-score. In a word, Swin-ResUNet+ obtains a much better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than previous CNN-based and Transformer-based methods.

DE 3D pose estimation; View consistency; Pose coherence; Anatomy prior
AB The rapid development of multi-view 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is attributed to the maturation of monocular 2D HPE and the geometry of 3D reconstruction. However, 2D detection outliers in occluded views due to neglect of view consistency, and 3D implausible poses due to lack of pose coherence, remain challenges. To solve this, we introduce a Multi-View Fusion module to refine 2D results by establishing view correlations. Then, Holistic Triangulation is proposed to infer the whole pose as an entirety, and anatomy prior is injected to maintain the pose coherence and improve the plausibility. Anatomy prior is extracted by PCA whose input is skeletal structure features, which can factor out global context and joint-by-joint relationship from abstract to concrete. Benefiting from the closed-form solution, the whole framework is trained end-to-end. Our method outperforms the state of the art in both precision and plausibility which is assessed by a new metric.

ID BACKGROUND LIGHT; FEATURES
AB Due to the influence of light absorption and scattering in the water medium, underwater images often appear with different degrees of blur, color distortion, and so on. The physical model-based method needs to establish image degradation processes and improve image quality by assuming and estimating complex parameters, which limits the generalization ability and practical application effect of these methods. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an image enhancement method of non-uniform scattering in turbid underwater based on neural network. First, the high-frequency and low-frequency components of underwater images were obtained through the difference of gaussian (DOG) and bilateral filtering (BF), respectively. Then, for the high-frequency component, pulse coupled neural networks (PCNN) to improve the edge details of the image. For low-frequency components, it is carried out in two steps: an adaptive automatic white balance and polynomial regression (AAWBPR) algorithm is proposed, which can effectively eliminate the color bias under different color temperatures and improve the brightness of images; the adaptive color and contrast enhancement (ACCE) method is used to further enhance the color and contrast of images. Finally, Decom-Net and the improved U-Net method are used to reduce the errors caused by the non-uniform scattering effect, weaken the noise interference, and enhance the overall effect of images. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can effectively improve the quality of turbid underwater non-uniform scattering images, enhance the contrast of images, reduce the complexity of parameters, and has good generalization performance and practical application effects.

AB The emergence of ACMix fundamentally integrates convolution and self-attention mechanisms, fully leveraging their advantages. However, it faces challenges in associating temporal sequences and struggles to achieve accurate feature sampling. Additionally, its global correlation ability makes it susceptible to interference from irrelevant information. To address these issues, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Mix Feature Extractor (STD-ME) based on ACMix. In STD-ME, we designed deformable modules for both convolution and attention branches, incorporating spatio-temporal context to enable more precise feature sampling. By integrating STD-ME into a tracker that employs multi-frame fusion, we aim to further enhance its performance. The utilization of Crop-Transform-Paste for manual data synthesis offers a novel perspective for self-supervised tracking. However, it is important to note that while this method has shown impressive results, the synthesized data lacks spatio-temporal continuity in attributes such as scale variation, rotation, illumination variation, position, and partial occlusion, which limits its alignment with real-world scenarios. Consequently, training trackers based on multi-frame fusion may face challenges in achieving significant breakthroughs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Transformation (STT). STT utilizes an Iterative Random Number Generator (IRNG) based on a normal distribution to probabilistically generate spatio-temporal continuous data. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on STD-ME and STT to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

AB High-frequency financial data is more difficult to predict than low-frequency data because it possesses nonlinearity, nonstationarity, higher volatility, and long memory and is frequently accompanied by the jump phenomena. In this paper, the nonparametric regression (NR) model based on kernel function is used to fit the nonlinear relationship between the nonstationary series Yt and its lagging series to model the trend of high frequency financial time series. Furthermore, the deep learning LSTM (long short-term memory) model is applied to capture the high volatility and frequent jumps of high frequency financial data and to improve the forecasting accuracy of the residual series. The results demonstrate that the hybrid NR and LSTM model has greatly improved the forecasting accuracy in several evaluation criteria. In comparison to NR, support vector machine (SVM), LSTM, ARIMA and NR-SVM models, the mean absolute error (MAE) of NR-LSTM has reduced by 89.78%, 97.85%, 86.48%, 32.47% and 89%, respectively. In addition, we have constructed the trading strategy for the Shanghai-Shenzhen 300 index by using the NR-LSTM model. The NR-LSTM model can continue to provide good returns even during a bear market, which can serve as a guide for investors. Furthermore, the NR-LSTM model also exhibits the best forecasting effect when we model the high-frequency data of Ping An bank in China, the FTSE 100 index in the UK, and the S&P 500 index in the US.

AB Accurate transformer fault diagnosis is crucial for maintaining the power system stability. Due the complex operation condition of the transformer, its faults are with the characteristic of multi-class faults, class-imbalance, and limited diagnosis data of availability. Additionally, some fault samples are only with overheating or discharge labels when collected, it is a challenge that how to how to use these samples. To address these issues, in this paper, a novel transformer fault diagnosis method based on a hybrid model of Res-Variational-Auto-Encoder (ResVAE) and ensemble learning (EL) model is proposed. Through a self-strengthening strategy, fault characteristics are extracted category-by-category by using a residual convolutional neural network, and low dimensional characteristics are mapped into characteristic fusion samples by VAE. Based on this strategy, an offline pre-training model is built based on ResVAE and EL. The hybrid model can obtain more information from offline source domain, enabling the EL to diagnose multiple fault types as well as undetermined faults. Considering 11 categories of imbalanced classification scenarios with limited sample sizes, the comparison is made between eight expansion and six diagnosis algorithms. The results show that the offline pre-training EL model increased the diagnostic accuracy up to 11.224% compared with tradition ratios method. The ResVAE-EL model achieves the highest diagnostic accuracy of 91.011%, which is 10.112% higher than that of the single offline pre-training model.

ID OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH; HEURISTICS; SAFETY
AB Evolutionary computing (EC) is widely used in dealing with combinatorial optimization problems (COP). Traditional EC methods can only solve a single task in a single run, while real-life scenarios often need to solve multiple COPs simultaneously. In recent years, evolutionary multitasking optimization (EMTO) has become an emerging topic in the EC community. And many methods have been designed to deal with multiple COPs concurrently through exchanging knowledge. However, many-task optimiza-tion, cross-domain knowledge transfer, and negative transfer are still significant challenges in this field. A new evolutionary multitasking algorithm based on adaptive seed transfer (MTEA-AST) is developed for multitasking COPs in this work. First, a dimension unification strategy is proposed to unify the dimensions of different tasks. And then, an adaptive task selection strategy is designed to capture the similarity between the target task and other online optimization tasks. The calculated similarity is exploited to select suitable source tasks for the target one and determine the transfer strength. Next, a task transfer strategy is established to select seeds from source tasks and correct unsuitable knowledge in seeds to suppress negative transfer. Finally, the experimental results indicate that MTEA-AST can adaptively transfer knowledge in both same-domain and cross-domain many-task environments. And the proposed method shows competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art EMTOs in experiments consisting of four COPs.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising architecture that disentangles the control plane from the data plane. A mainstream southbound protocol for controller-to-switch communication in SDN is OpenFlow. In an OpenFlow-enabled network, SDN switches are connected to the logically centralized control plane, which issues control messages to direct packet forwarding and processing in the data plane. Given that the finite capacity of physical flow tables of switches, typically implemented with ternary content addressable memory (TCAM), attackers have the ability to carry out Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks aimed at depleting the TCAM's resources and causing an overflow of the flow table. In this paper, we propose FTODefender, a method combining eviction and cut-off attack sources to detect Low-rate Flow Table Overflow (LFTO) attacks and mitigate this kind of attacks in time. FTODefender consists of two modules: Detector and Mitigator. Detector periodically examines the flow table and extract four specific detection features. It then employs the trained CRITIC weights to calculate the detection score based on these extracted features to verify if the LFTO attack has happened. Mitigator computes the features for each flow and utilizes the LightGBM-LR classification model to identify attack flows among all flows. Then, the module evicts the malicious rules to mitigate attacks. Finally, Mitigator counts the occurrence of each source IP address in the eviction list, determines the attacker IP based on a predefined threshold, and issues a flow rule to drop all packets originating from the attacker's IPs to sever the attack sources. Simulations show the effectiveness of FTODefender in mitigating the LFTO attacks, which proves that FTODefender is a practical solution to flow table overflow attacks.

AB The firefly algorithm (FA) is a well-known metaheuristic algorithm that has demonstrated effectiveness and superiority in a variety of optimization tasks. To alleviate the oscillation caused by fireflies during the search process and improve the solution quality of the FA, this paper proposes an improved FA based on the hierarchy strategy (HSFA). In the HSFA, the firefly population was separated into elite and non-elite groups based on fitness values, and distinct attractive models were used for each group to improve the performance of the HSFA from the perspective of exploration and exploitation capabilities. This enhances the convergence speed and solution quality of the algorithm. The HSFA was run on two sets of standard benchmark functions, and its performance was evaluated using two practical engineering design problems. The experimental results demonstrate that the HSFA outperforms state-of-the-art optimization algorithms.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Incorporating prior knowledge has been identified as a promising approach to enhance existing pre-training models in cloze-style machine reading, as observed in recent studies. Despite the use of external knowledge graphs (KG) and transformer-based models like BERT in most existing models, the identification of the most pertinent ambiguous entities in KG, as well as the extraction of the optimal subgraphs, remains problematic. To address these challenges, we introduce the LUKE-Graph model, which constructs a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive relationships between entities in the documents without relying on external KGs. We then employ a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to combine the reasoning information of the graph with the contextual representation generated by the pre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive an entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware representation. Furthermore, we present Gated-RGAT, an enhancement to RGAT that incorporates a gating mechanism to control the question information during the graph convolution operation. This mechanism emulates the human reasoning process in selecting the most suitable entity candidate based on question information. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LUKE-Graph model surpasses the LUKE state-of-the-art model on the ReCoRD dataset, which focuses on commonsense reasoning, and the WikiHop dataset, which centers on multi-hop reasoning problems.

AB The inverse analysis of the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) determines all the preference relationships required by each decision-maker (DM) according to a given stability definition to ensure that the given state is stable. In the paper, a matrix representation approach for the inverse graph model with fuzzy preference relations is proposed to obtain all the preference relations for each DM making the stability result based on the fuzzy stability definition, including fuzzy Nash, fuzzy general metarationality, fuzzy symmetric metarationality, and fuzzy sequential stability definition. For the twoDM graph model, the fuzzy preference relation over states, unilateral movements, and fuzzy unilateral improvements are refreshed by using the matrix forms. Furthermore, for the multiple DMs model, the joint movements and joint improvement for a collection including at least two DM are represented by using matrix representation. Finally, the matrix relationship for specifying the required preference relation in the framework of inverse graph model with fuzzy preferences is derived. To illustrate the usefulness of the matrix representation of inverse graph model with fuzzy preference relations, this paper demonstrates it using a real-life conflict of the Elmira groundwater contamination conflict.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB This work proposes a strategy to help in selecting a synthetic sampling algorithm that enhances the figures of merit of imbalanced pattern recognition models. Three imbalance quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) datasets were used to highlight the efficiency of the present approach. This approach evaluates the pattern recognition algorithms' figures of merit using an experimental design organization. The factor analysis was performed using each figure of merits individually and simultaneously with the Derringer and Suich desirability function. Here, the aim is to better understand the influence of synthetic sampling on pattern recognition models' figure of merits to develop a strategy to choose the sample that may lead to predictions with enhanced overall figures of metric and discard the sample that prejudices the models. Three undersampling (regular downsampling, undersampling based on clustering and Tomek links), three oversampling (regular upsampling, SMOTE, and ADASYN), and two hybrid sampling (SMOTE-TL and SPIDER) methods were used to balance the datasets to build the models. Due to these datasets' non-Gaussian characteristics proven by the multivariate Shapiro-Wilk test, the classification models were based on support vector machine with radial base function, C5.0, artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, and random forest algorithms. For these datasets, it was observed that oversampling methods tend to increase the sensitivity and accuracy while undersampling increases the accuracy and specificity. Hybrid methods tend to improve all the figures of merit. However, it is harder to correctly balance the samples between the classes, especially when few variables for a sample are available. Comparison with the original manuscript data results showed that proper sampling preprocessing can enhance the figure of merits of imbalanced datasets.

ID CONSENSUS CONTROL
AB Leader-follower consensus problem for multiagent systems (MASs) is an important research hotspot. However, the existing methods take the leader system matrix as a priori knowledge for each agent to design the controller and use the leader's state information. In fact, only the output information may be available in some practical applications. On this basis, this article first designs a novel adaptive distributed dynamic event-triggered observer for each follower to learn the minimum polynomial coefficients of the leader system matrix instead of the leader system matrix. The proposed method is scalable and suitable for large-scale MASs and can reduce the information transmission dimension in observer design. Then, an adaptive dynamic event-triggered compensator based on the observer and leader output information is designed for each follower, thereby solving the leader-follower consensus problem. Finally, several simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

ID CAUSAL-STRUCTURE
AB Learning a directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data plays a crucial role in causal inference and machine learning. However, the scarcity of observational data is a common phenomenon in real-world applications, where the current DAG learning methods may cause unsatisfactory performance in the context of small data samples. Data enhancement has been recognized as one of the key techniques for improving the generalization abilities of learning models utilizing small data samples. However, due to the inherent difficulty of sampling small datasets to generate high-quality new data samples, this approach has not been widely used in DAG learning. To alleviate this problem, we propose a data enhancement-based DAG learning (DE-DAG) approach. Specifically, DE-DAG first presents an integrated data sampling strategy for DAG learning and data sampling, then constructs a sample-level adaptive distance computing algorithm for selecting high-quality samples from the sampled datasets, and finally implements a DAG learning method on enhanced datasets consisting of high-quality samples and the original data samples. Experimental results obtained on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

AB Robotic rigid contact-rich manipulation in an unstructured dynamic environment requires an effective resolution for smart manufacturing. As the most common use case for the intelligence industry, a lot of studies based on reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been conducted to improve the performances of single peg-in-hole assembly. However, existing RL methods are difficult to apply to multiple peg-in-hole issues due to more complicated geometric and physical constraints. In addition, previously limited solutions for multiple peg-in-hole assembly are hard to transfer into real industrial scenarios flexibly. To effectively address these issues, this work designs a novel and more challenging multiple peg-in-hole assembly setup by using the advantage of the Industrial Metaverse. We propose a detailed solution scheme to solve this task. Specifically, multiple modalities, including vision, proprioception, and force/torque, are learned as compact representations to account for the complexity and uncertainties and improve the sample efficiency. Furthermore, RL is used in the simulation to train the policy, and the learned policy is transferred to the real world without extra exploration. Domain randomization and impedance control are embedded into the policy to narrow the gap between simulation and reality. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, showcasing successful multiple peg-in-hole assembly and generalization across different object shapes in real-world scenarios.

AB In the field of dynamic scheduling, workers and scheduling models (SMs) play a crucial role in decision-making. Workers are able to help SM training by sample labeling, thereby enhancing the decision-making ability of SMs. However, existing supervised learning methods require a large number of labeled samples to train SMs, which limits the learning efficiency between workers and SMs. In this article, a human-machine interactive learning method based on active learning (HMILM/AL) is proposed. The method introduces active learning (AL) techniques to reduce labeling costs and improve learning efficiency. Referring to the AL framework, only a small subset of samples are selected from an unlabeled dataset and are labeled by workers, to train SMs. To further reduce labeling costs, sample selection, the key to the HMILM/AL, is improved by two strategies. First, a novel hybrid selection strategy (NHSS) is developed. By identifying and selecting more useful samples in an unlabeled dataset, the NHSS promotes efficient use of workers, and reduces labeling costs. Second, an enhanced NHSS (E-NHSS) is proposed, which considers both the difficulty of labeling samples and the usefulness of the samples. It reduces labeling costs by selecting easily labeled samples as much as possible. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through experiments conducted in a real smart workshop. The results demonstrate that the HMILM/AL is very competitive compared with existing supervised learning methods. Moreover, both the NHSS and the E-NHSS can reduce labeling costs efficiently.

ID ATTENTION
AB Text-based person search (TBPS) is a challenging task that aims to search pedestrian images with the same identity from an image gallery given a query text. In recent years, TBPS has made remarkable progress, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve superior performance by learning local fine-grained correspondence between images and texts. However, most existing methods rely on explicitly generated local parts to model fine-grained correspondence between modalities, which is unreliable due to the lack of contextual information or the potential introduction of noise. Moreover, the existing methods seldom consider the information inequality problem between modalities caused by image-specific information. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient joint multilevel alignment network (MANet) for TBPS, which can learn aligned image/text feature representations between modalities at multiple levels, and realize fast and effective person search. Specifically, we first design an image-specific information suppression (ISS) module, which suppresses image background and environmental factors by relation-guided localization (RGL) and channel attention filtration (CAF), respectively. This module effectively alleviates the information inequality problem and realizes the alignment of information volume between images and texts. Second, we propose an implicit local alignment (ILA) module to adaptively aggregate all pixel/word features of image/text to a set of modality-shared semantic topic centers and implicitly learn the local fine-grained correspondence between modalities without additional supervision and cross-modal interactions. Also, a global alignment (GA) is introduced as a supplement to the local perspective. The cooperation of global and local alignment modules enables better semantic alignment between modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple databases demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our MANet.

AB Precise short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a crucial role in the smooth operation of power systems, future capacity planning, unit commitment, and demand response. However, due to its non-stationary and its dependency on multiple cyclic and non-cyclic calendric features and non-linear highly correlated metrological features, an accurate load forecasting with already existing techniques is challenging. To overcome this challenge, a novel hybrid technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and a modified split-convolution (SC) neural network (LSTM-SC) is proposed for single-step and multi-step STLF. The concatenating order of LSTM and SC in the proposed hybrid network provides an excellent capability of extraction of sequence-dependent features and other hierarchical spatial features. The model is evaluated by the Pakistan National Grid load dataset recorded by the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC). The load data is pre-processed and multiple other correlated features are incorporated into the data for performance enhancement. For generalization capability, the performance of LSTM-SC is evaluated on publicly available datasets of American Electric Power (AEP) and Independent System Operator New England (ISO-NE). The effect of temperature, a highly correlated input feature, on load forecasting is investigated either by removing the temperature or adding a Gaussian random noise into it. The performance evaluation in terms of RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of the proposed model on the NTDC dataset are 500.98, 372.62, and 3.72% for multi-step while 322.90, 244.22, and 2.38% for single-step load forecasting. The result shows that the proposed method has less forecasting error, strong generalization capability, and satisfactory performance on multi-horizon.

AB The optimization of industrial processes is crucial for enhancing operational safety, productivity, and energy efficiency. However, the increasing complexity of industrial processes poses challenges to the applicability of intelligent optimization algorithms, such as the state transition algorithm. The main challenges include limited individual diversity, the intricate task of escaping local optima, and the underutilization of solutions beyond predefined boundaries. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a novel intelligent stochastic optimization algorithm called the communication-driven multi-strategy state transition algorithm (CDMS-STA). CDMS-STA incorporates three selfdesigned strategies: communication, self-learning, and cross-boundary solution processing. Specifically, the communication strategy enhances the diversity of candidate solutions by promoting information exchange and sharing among individuals. The self-learning strategy facilitates adaptive adjustments based on historical information. The cross-boundary solution processing strategy maximizes the utilization of solutions beyond defined boundaries. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted on a numerical sample case and two chemical process cases. The experimental results demonstrate that CDMS-STA outperforms several state-of-the-art optimization methods to find the optimal solution, which also validates the potential of the proposed algorithm for practical application in industrial process optimization.

AB A 32-bit floating-point format is often used for the development and training of deep neural networks. Training and inference in deep learning-optimized codecs can result in enormous performance and energy efficiency advantages. However, training and inferring low-bit neural networks still pose a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a sorting method that maintains accuracy in numerical formats with a low number of bits. We tested this method on convolutional neural networks, including AlexNet. Using our method, we found that in our convolutional neural network, the accuracy achieved with 11 bits matches that of the IEEE 32-bit format. Similarly, in AlexNet, the accuracy achieved with 10 bits matches that of the IEEE 32-bit format. These results suggest that the sorting method shows promise for calculations with limited accuracy.

AB Aggregation, the gathering of individuals into a single group as observed in animals such as birds, bees, and amoeba, is known to provide protection against predators or resistance to adverse environmental conditions for the whole. Cue-based aggregation, where environmental cues determine the location of aggregation, is known to be challenging when the swarm density is low. Here, we propose a novel aggregation method applicable to real robots in low-density swarms. Previously, Landmark-Based Aggregation (LBA) method had used odometric dead-reckoning coupled with visual landmarks and yielded better aggregation in low-density swarms. However, the method's performance was affected adversely by odometry drift, jeopardizing its application in real-world scenarios. In this article, a novel Reinforcement Learning-based Aggregation method, RLA, is proposed to increase aggregation robustness, thus making aggregation possible for real robots in low-density swarm settings. Systematic experiments conducted in a kinematic-based simulator and on real robots have shown that the RLA method yielded larger aggregates, is more robust to odometry noise than the LBA method, and adapts better to environmental changes while not being sensitive to parameter tuning, making it better deployable under real-world conditions.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH
AB The dendritic cell algorithm (DCA) is a classification algorithm based on the biological antigen presentation process. Its classification efficiently depends on a data preprocessing procedure, where feature selection and signal categorization are the main work for generating input signals. Several methods have been employed (e.g., correlation coefficient and rough set theory). Those studies preferred to measure the importance of features by evaluating their relevance to the class. Generally, they determined a mapping relationship between important features and signal categories of DCA based on expert knowledge. Typically, those studies ignore the effect of unimportant features, and the mapping relationship determined by expertise may not produce an optimal classification result. Thus, a hybrid model, GA-DCA, is proposed for feature selection and signal categorization based on the genetic algorithm (GA). This study transforms feature selection and signal categorization into a grouping task (i.e., divides features into different signal groups). This study introduces a permutation-based expression with "Group" symbols to represent a potential feature grouping scheme. Correspondingly, adaptive operators are proposed to expand each possible scheme on the path from the initial feature grouping to the best feature grouping. GA-DCA searches the optimal feature subset and automatically assigns them to the most suitable signal groups without expertise. This study verifies the proposed approach by employing the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Keel-dataset Repository, and significant performance improvement is achieved.

ID IMBALANCED DATA; CONCEPT DRIFT
AB Classification of imbalanced unlabelled data streams with concept drift in evolving streams has posed many challenges recently. Learner performance from the minority class is poor at high imbalance degrees. This causes drift detection to fail. Therefore, the existing model cannot be updated, resulting in poor classifier performance. Detecting drifts is typically done through supervised learning. They are impractical despite their effectiveness in detecting drifts. In real-world applications, only a portion of the data stream can be labelled as oracle assistance is pricey and laborious. To alleviate these problems, a novel technique which is a cluster based active learning for class imbalance and concept drift (CBAL) is presented in the paper. Adaptive sampling strategies are used for solving high imbalance degrees. A two-layer drift detection strategy is used for detecting drifts where the first layer is unsupervised and the second layer is supervised. To reduce the labelling cost this framework uses a clustering technique for querying the labels. Extensive experiments over synthetic and real-world data streams exhibit better classification performance. CBAL detects the drifts with fewer false alarms and with lesser oracle intervention. For high imbalanced case (i.e., 10%), the performance of CBAL is 53% and higher, whereas the performance of the other algorithms is zero or nil. The number of drifts detected by CBAL is much more accurate and it also reduces the labelling cost by 90%.

ID FEATURE ADAPTATION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Small-sample-size problem is always a challenge for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Considering the co-occurrence of land-cover classes between similar scenes, transfer learning can be performed, and cross-scene classification is deemed a feasible approach proposed in recent years. In cross-scene classification, the source scene which possesses sufficient labelled samples is used for assisting the classification of the target scene that has a few labelled samples. In most situations, different HSI scenes are imaged by different sensors resulting in their various input feature dimensions (i.e. number of bands), hence heterogeneous transfer learning is desired. An end-to-end heterogeneous transfer learning algorithm namely domain-invariant attention network (DIAN) is proposed to solve the cross-scene classification problem. The DIAN mainly contains two modules. (1) A feature-alignment CNN (FACNN) is applied to extract features from source and target scenes, respectively, aiming at projecting the heterogeneous features from two scenes into a shared low-dimensional subspace. (2) A domain-invariant attention block is developed to gain cross-domain consistency with a specially designed class-specific domain-invariance loss, thus further eliminating the domain shift. The experiments on two different cross-scene HSI datasets show that the proposed DIAN achieves satisfying classification results.

AB The Swin-Transformer is a variant of the Vision Transformer, which constructs a hierarchical Transformer that computes representations with shifted windows and window multi-head self-attention. This method can handle the scale invariance problem and performs well in many computer vision tasks. In image retrieval, high-quality feature descriptors are necessary to improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a self-ensemble Swin-Transformer network structure to fuse the features of different layers of the Swin-Transformer network, eliminating noise points present in a single layer, and improving the retrieval effect. Two experiments were conducted, one on the In-shop Clothes Retrieval dataset and another on the Stanford Online Product dataset. The experiments showed that the proposed method significantly increased the retrieval effect of features extracted using Vision Transformer, surpassing previous state-of-the-art image retrieval methods. In the second experiment, the feature map of the trained model was visualized, revealing that the improved network significantly reduces focus on some noise points and enhances focus on image features compared to the original network.
   In order to effectively integrate consistent information between the multiple layers of the Swin Transformer, the model conducts parameter self-ensemble of the internal blocks of the Swin Transformer.image

AB This paper presents a new design approach to achieve decentralized optimal control of nonlinear singularly perturbed interconnected systems based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Due to the existence of slow and fast phenomena in the fuzzy singularly perturbed interconnected systems, which brings computational errors when solving the coupled algebraic Riccati equation. Therefore, a model-based parallel hybrid iterative method is proposed, in which system dynamics are required. On this basis, a model-free parallel hybrid reinforcement learning method is proposed. As a consequence, compared with policy iteration, the proposed parallel hybrid reinforcement learning method is independent of an initial admissible controller. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through a numerical example.

AB Trapezoidal Atanassov's intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrAIFNs) is one of the useful tools to manage the fuzziness and vagueness in expressing decision data and solving decision making problems. In this paper, based on the operation laws defined by strict t-norms and t-conorms, four kinds of power geometric operators, i.e., triangular (co)norms-based (T-based) power geometric operator of TrAIFNs, T-based weighted power geometric operator of TrAIFNs, T-based power ordered weighted geometric operator of TrAIFNs, and T-based power hybrid geometric operator of TrAIFNs, are developed. To minimize loss of information in process, a new ranking method of TrAIFNs are presented based on the newly proposed possibility differences of TrAIFNs; Moreover, utilizing strict t-conorms, a new similarity measurement of TrAIFNs is innovated. Thereby, in combination with all the referred elements, two approaches to multiple attributes group decision making using TrAIFNs are developed. In the end, the feasibility of those methods and the superiority over the existing methods are demonstrated by a numerical example.

ID ANALOG; CALIBRATION; CODE
AB Errors in analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) occur due to internal links or other electronic parts; faults that may occur during code conversion cannot be overlooked because signal digitalisation demands a large dynamic range and high resolution. This paper presents a new and accurate self-test method to compensate for one of the most effective errors of ADC because of its effect, which may result in a missing code, which is a differential nonlinear (DNL) of a 10-bit SAR-ADC. The proposed method includes three stages: DNL error modelling for nonideal system implementation, detection, and correction. To evaluate the proposed technique, sinusoidal and sawtooth signals are applied as analog inputs to the proposed system. Adaptivity, speed, and accuracy are the main motivations of this work, which provide high accuracy compared to other techniques, up to 9.6 ENOB and 59.2 SNR with sawtooth signal and 9.5 ENOB and 59.2 SNR with sinewave signals.

TI Optimal Deployment for Hybrid Sensor Networks Based on Efficient Node

ID OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; COVERAGE HOLES
AB Hybrid sensor networks, which contain mobile nodes and stationary nodes, are being used more and more widely. The second deployment of mobile nodes is a key problem to be solved, and the deployment performance of the network directly affects the monitoring effect of the network. Optimizing the configuration ratio of the two nodes can effectively reduce the network cost. In this paper, under the premise of knowing the coverage of the required monitoring area, the impact of sensor devices on node configuration is studied through parameter analysis, and the number and types of sensors that should be deployed in the hybrid sensor network are deduced, which can be conveniently and accurately used to design the actual hybrid sensor network. At the same time, for the secondary deployment of mobile nodes, this paper proposes a new mobile coverage method BS-CCP (box search and concentric circle positioning) to improve the coverage of the hybrid sensor network and maximize the coverage of the target area with the specified sensor types and numbers. Compared with existing work, the method in this paper reduces the number of iterations and reduces the number of required nodes. Comparing BS-CCP with the existing network mobile coverage algorithm, the experimental results show that the coverage obtained by this method is larger and more efficient.

AB Reading comprehension involves the process of reading and understanding textual information in order to answer questions related to it. It finds practical applications in various domains such as domain-specific FAQs, search engines, and dialog systems. Resource-rich languages like English, Japanese, Chinese, and most European languages benefit from the availability of numerous datasets and resources, enabling the development of machine reading comprehension (MRC) systems. However, building MRC systems for low-resource languages (LRL) with limited datasets, such as Vietnamese, Urdu, Bengali, and Hindi, poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this study utilizes quantitative analysis to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) with the aim of comprehending the recent global shift in MRC research from high-resource languages (HRL) to low-resource languages. Notably, existing literature reviews on MRC lack comprehensive studies that compare techniques specifically designed for rich and low-resource languages. Hence, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the MRC research landscape in low-resource languages, offering valuable insights and a list of suggestions to enhance LRL-MRC research.

AB Honey formation optimization (HFO) is originally proposed for design problems where the definitions of the objective functions are known priori or under design. HFO extends the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with the concept of multiple components in a source and the worker bees tending to collect components currently needed. However, the necessity of component design for a particular problem makes the HFO not applicable to optimize an arbitrary objective function. In this paper, HFO with single component (HFO-1) is proposed in order to remove this hardship of HFO for numerical function optimizations. Unlike the HFO, which only models the honey formation inside the bee, the HFO-1 further model the honey production process in the hive where sources are turned into honey-forms inside the bee and mature in time through various types of mixing processes using enzymes until the whole mixture becomes mature in the hive. During mixing process, the Pbest (population best) is used as primal catalyzer that metamorphoses other forms towards itself. When the current mixture is mature, a new mixture is started from a new site and saturated with the Gbest (global best) to fasten the maturity of the new mixture towards Gbest. HFO-1 is original in that it extends the formation phase of HFO with novel local search and importantly introduces 3 new phases, mixing, maturation, and saturation, specific to honey production. In this article, 6 algorithms (Whale Optimization, Differential Search, Particle Swarm Optimization, Improved Grey Wolf, Moth-Flame Optimization, HFO-1) are comparatively studied on the basis of 60 popular benchmark functions, containing CEC2019 functions. The results show that HFO-1 is superior to others according to mean absolute error, mean variance and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test analysis.

ID SPECKLE NOISE
AB While recent years have witnessed a dramatic upsurge of exploiting deep neural networks toward solving image denoising, existing methods mostly rely on simple noise assumptions, such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), JPEG compression noise and camera sensor noise, and a general-purpose blind denoising method for real images remains unsolved. In this paper, we attempt to solve this problem from the perspective of network architecture design and training data synthesis. Specifically, for the network architecture design, we propose a swin-conv block to incorporate the local modeling ability of residual convolutional layer and non-local modeling ability of swin transformer block, and then plug it as the main building block into the widely-used image-to-image translation UNet architecture. For the training data synthesis, we design a practical noise degradation model which takes into consideration different kinds of noise (including Gaussian, Poisson, speckle, JPEG compression, and processed camera sensor noises) and resizing, and also involves a random shuffle strategy and a double degradation strategy. Extensive experiments on AGWN removal and real image denoising demonstrate that the new network architecture design achieves state-of-the-art performance and the new degradation model can help to significantly improve the practicability. We believe our work can provide useful insights into current denoising research. The source code is available at https://github.com/cszn/SCUNet.

   swarm optimization; Maximum principal curvatures; ISOData Thresholding;

AB Retinal fundus images provide a large amount of space for blood vessel segmentation. The result of segmentation is not only a vital indicator of diabetic retinopathy (an eye-related disease), but also a good facilitator for ophthalmologists (eye specialists or eye doctors) to carry out essential diagnostic procedures. Diabetic retinopathy, especially in diabetic patients, is manifested when tiny blood vessels get bleed. In this paper, a novel method called singular value decomposition (SVD)-based maximum principal curvatures (SVD-PC) using level set procedure from retinal images and segmentation of blood vessel vascular structure is proposed. Most of the researchers worked on the green RGB retinal image channel. But, because of intensity variations that generate blurriness, the green channel version of RGB has hidden noise, which is a tough challenge to overcome in a processing image. Moreover, the blood vessels in an image have insufficient local contrast, and to tackle this issue for efficient image processing, distinct filters were applied in the past. Here, in this proposed method, SVD, which is a mathematical technique related to vector calculus and matrix algebra, is used to efficiently deal with the complexities aroused working with green channel and filters. SVD, in our proposed method, as a pre-processing technique is effective in: (i) extracting colored feature set of blood vessel pixels from input image and (ii) effectively converting feature set pixel image into gray. Later, maximum principal curvature values of those converted gray image feature set pixels are calculated in the post-processing phase, followed by ISOData Thresholding to segment the tree-shaped vasculature, which morphological operator is applied to remove the unwanted falsely segmented vessels. The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and has given segmentation accuracy of 97.8%. This proposed algorithm operated on images of STARE as well as DRIVE datasets. It is evident that singular value decomposition is quite effective and outstanding when compared with another proposed method in this paper, i.e., using maximum principal curvatures based on principal component analysis.

AB The relevance of data fusion in handling big data in blockchain-enabled healthcare systems is of utmost importance in today's data-driven healthcare landscape. As healthcare systems continue to generate vast amounts of data from various sources, the need to effectively manage and analyze this data becomes crucial for informed decision-making, improved patient outcomes, and efficient healthcare operations. The gaps for time complexity and inaccuracy of feature fusion in the existing algorithms have been identified by surveying the existing literature and this article is proposing a multi-attribute feature fusion algorithm blockchain communications based on ant colony neural networks (ACNN) to overcome the problems in the state-of-the-arts. This article applies the feature decomposition method for communication between blockchain-based healthcare transactions, and optimizes the information based on the data characteristics. The proposed algorithm identifies the properties and attributes of the data by making use of rough set theory. A genetic algorithm is also used to improve the ACNN which enhances the search ability by minimizing the space complexity of the solution space. The multi-attribute fusion mechanism extracts the information from the blockchain transactions and filters out the characteristics of data using the proposed method, and achieves better accuracy. The empirical results show that the fusion error of the blockchain communications based on multi-attribute feature fusion algorithm is relatively small and stable. The outcomes of the proposed fusion mechanism are promising and it has been found that the proposed mechanism produces accurate results with minimal errors. The average energy consumption rate during the transition of data is below 2% which reflects the viability of the proposed fusion mechanism for blockchain-based healthcare transactions.

AB This research introduces an innovative approach to explore the cognitive and biologically inspired underpinnings of feature vector splitting for analyzing the significance of different attributes in e-security biometric signature recognition applications. Departing from traditional methods of concatenating features into an extended set, we employ multiple splitting strategies, aligning with cognitive principles, to preserve control over the relative importance of each feature subset. Our methodology is applied to three diverse databases (MCYT100, MCYT300, and SVC) using two classifiers (vector quantization and dynamic time warping with one and five training samples). Experimentation demonstrates that the fusion of pressure data with spatial coordinates (x and y) consistently enhances performance. However, the inclusion of pen-tip angles in the same feature set yields mixed results, with performance improvements observed in select cases. This work delves into the cognitive aspects of feature fusion, shedding light on the cognitive relevance of feature vector splitting in e-security biometric applications.

AB Recently, online optimisation-based scene flow estimation has attracted significant attention due to its strong domain adaptivity. Although online optimisation-based methods have made significant advances, the performance is far from satisfactory as only flow priors are considered, neglecting scene priors that are crucial for the representations of dynamic scenes. To address this problem, the authors introduce a dual-branch MLP-based architecture to encode implicit scene representations from a source 3D point cloud, which can additionally synthesise a target 3D point cloud. Thus, the mapping function between the source and synthesised target 3D point clouds is established as an extra implicit regulariser to capture scene priors. Moreover, their model infers both flow and scene priors in a stronger bidirectional manner. It can effectively establish spatiotemporal constraints among the synthesised, source, and target 3D point clouds. Experiments on four challenging datasets, including KITTI scene flow, FlyingThings3D, Argoverse, and nuScenes, show that our method can achieve potential and comparable results, proving its effectiveness and generality.

AB In practical spectral detection, the presence of noise degrades the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new spectrum denoising method combines sparse representation and low-rank learning called low-rank recovery dictionary learning (LRRDL). Firstly, based on the homogeneity of the spectrum, we employ dictionary learning to extract the sparse features in the spectrum. Secondly, the superposition of spectrum is exploited to embed the low-rank property of clean dictionary into dictionary learning to address the problem that dictionary atoms can be contaminated by high levels of noise. Then, we use LRRDL to built a low-rank denoising model. Finally, in the denoising stage, the dictionary model will be used to perform a sparse reconstruction of the noisy spectrum to complete the denoising work. Experiments are conducted on three datasets and the proposed method is compared with several advanced methods. The result shows our method achieves better denoising performance than other methods.

AB Deep learning, particularly with convolutional neural networks, shows promise in modelling near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), but the lack of robust generalisation across instruments often affects performance in practice. Here, we investigate a method to increase the robustness of this approach. The proposed method involves using a simple data augmentation technique during the training process. The performance of convolutional neural network regression is compared to partial least squares regression (PLSR) using kiwifruit data collected from multiple handheld devices over three seasons and mango data collected from a single device over four seasons. The results suggest that data augmentation for NIR spectra can prevent overfitting. In particular, augmenting the training data to mimic spectra collected over multiple devices results in a neural network model with improved performance over PLSR.

AB Adsorption kinetics are commonly modeled using pseudo-first order (PFO) and pseudo-second order (PSO) rate laws. Both models are formulated via differential equations whose coefficients are commonly treated as deterministic quantities, which are calculated from experimental data using regression techniques. In this paper, we propose a full randomization of both models by assuming that all the parameters of the PFO and PSO models are random variables with arbitrary densities. Then, we probabilistically solve both models by determining semi-explicit expressions of the first probability density functions of the corresponding solution stochastic processes, as well as the densities of the time until a fixed adsorbed amount of reactant has been reached for each model too. The analysis is conducted under very general assumptions and is based on extensive application of the so-called Random Variable Transformation (RVT) technique. Finally, we apply all the aforementioned theoretical findings to model the adsorption of cadmium ions onto tree fern, using real data. We compare the results obtained by the randomized PFO and PSO models, using a Bayesian and a randomized version of the least mean square method to assign reasonable densities to model parameters. After comparing the results, the PSO model is selected, and, we then show how the RVT technique can be applied to obtain further key information, such as the second probability density function, of the solution and the covariance function.

AB Integrating information from multiple sensors, known as sensor fusion, is particularly challenging for small datasets where selecting from the plethora of available methods poses a significant challenge in chemometric analysis. This study compares several sensor fusion methods (spanning data-level, feature-level, and decisionlevel fusion) based on partial least squares (PLS) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. This study is the first to compare simple sensor fusion methods to the latest multiblock PLS models and parallel-input CNNs, to the best of our knowledge. We demonstrate sensor fusion using a small dataset of 177 rock samples on two prediction tasks: predicting lithium (Li) concentrations and zirconium (Zr) concentrations using three types of spectra, namely X-ray fluorescence (XRF), visible to short-wave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The best-performing Li model was PLS using XRF (mean RMSEP: 0.078%) and the best sensor fusion model was ROSA (mean RMSEP: 0.087%). The best Zr model was a high-level fusion of PLS models (mean RMSEP: 0.042%).

AB With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, convolutional neural networks have been widely used in the field of spectroscopy. In this paper, a bilinear branching Densenet network model (BO-Densenet) based on multi-scale feature fusion is constructed by applying a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to classify six woods: Tung wood, Balsa wood, Poplar wood, PVA-modified Poplar wood, Nano-silica-sol modified Poplar wood, and PVA-Nano-silica-sol modified Poplar wood. The results show that BO-Densenet achieves 98.90% accuracy in classification on the test set, which is higher than 82.09% of Partial Least Squares, and also higher than 89.88% of Lenet, 93.56% of Alexnet, 94.12% of Resnet-18 and 96.69% of Densenet-40 when compared with other deep learning algorithms. This shows that the BO-Densenet proposed in this paper can accurately achieve wood classification and has potential application prospects.

AB Plant-Nitrogen is a vital element that significantly influences plant growth, fruit quality, and yield. However, excessive Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application can have adverse effects on both plant health and environment. Traditional methods of plant-N analysis face numerous challenges like time-consuming procedures, hazardous chemicals, low precision, and limited throughput, hindering efficient and accurate analysis in laboratories. In recent years, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) has emerged as an innovative and rapid method for plant-N analysis, offering non-destructive, cost-effective, and real-time measurements with high accuracy and throughput. This research aimed to explore the potential of utilizing miniaturized handheld Near-Infrared (NIR) sensors in conjunction with machine learning (ML) and chemometrics to assess the N status of tomato plants leaves in the field. Through this study, A comprehensive analysis involving 18 models utilizing different regression and spectral preprocessing methods was conducted. The findings indicate that combining the first- or second-order SG derivatives with the MSC is the optimal spectral data preprocessing method, and that incorporating wavelengths selection techniques, such as GA-PLS and GA-SVM, improves the predictive accuracy of the models by reducing the number of wavelengths considered. The best model's performance was assessed using R2, RMSE, and RPD, yielding values of 81.0-82.8, 7.4-7.8, and 2.3-2.4, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates that combining NIRS with ML and chemometrics enables effective evaluation of plant-N status using leaves total N content as a proxy variable and emphasizes the significance of integrating spectral preprocessing, modeling, and wavelengths selection techniques to enhance data quality and mitigate the influence of environmental factors that may impact the accuracy of NIRS-based evaluations.

ID REGRESSION
AB Multi-response partial least squares regression (PLS2) is commonly used in analyzing high-dimensional multi response data, particularly estimating prediction regions. However, calculating prediction regions by local linearization methods requires the assumption of normality to obtain high coverage level. It has been shown that methods under distribution-free assumption outperform local linearization methods. Therefore, in this work, several new methods are proposed to construct distribution-free prediction regions of PLS2 models. The estimated prediction regions do not rely on trivial assumptions and have relatively lower computational cost. Analyses of simulation and real NIR datasets show that the proposed methods have higher predictive coverage and is more computational effective than local linearization methods.

AB The batch process has the characteristics of nonlinear and multiphase due to variation operation conditions. Nonlinear and multiphase modeling of the batch process is very important to understand the running state of a process and improve the monitoring effect. In this work, a multiphase multi-way concurrent locally weighted projection regression algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the entire process is partitioned into phases according to local quality-related characteristics and time sequence. Secondly, the nonlinear process is modeled with locally linear models in each partitioned phase, the global approximation results are obtained by weighting all the local models. Thirdly, the complete monitoring indices of quality-related and process related are built, and the quality variables are predicted while exploiting the regression structure for quality and process monitoring. Finally, a nonlinear numerical process and the penicillin fermentation process are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

ID SINTERING TEMPERATURE
AB The combustion state of the lime rotary kiln is mainly reflected in the temperature of the calcination zone. However, due to the high temperature in the calcination zone during the production process, it is not possible to directly measure using instruments. This paper proposes a soft sensing strategy to address the issue of difficulty in measuring the temperature of the calcination zone of a lime rotary kiln. Firstly, due to significant disturbances and coupling of production process variables, principal component analysis is used to reduce the input dimension and computational complexity of the data, thereby improving the efficiency of the soft sensing model. Then, stochastic configuration networks with good predictive performance is used to model and predict the principal components. Meanwhile, an improved Hammersley-based Salp swarm algorithm is proposed to optimize the key parameter regularization factor of the stochastic configuration networks. Finally, the validity of the soft sensing model is verified by the actual collected production data of the lime rotary kiln. Multiple evaluation indicators and comparison results indicate that the proposed soft sensing model for the calcination zone temperature of lime rotary kilns has higher prediction accuracy and modeling quality compared to other models.

AB Accurate, high-throughput, and unbiased analysis of plutonium oxide particles is necessary for analysis of the underlying phenomena associated with the process parameters involved in its synthesis. Compared to qualitative and taxonomic descriptors, quantitative descriptors of particle morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) have shown success in analyzing process parameters of uranium oxides. Among other candidates, a neural network called Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) has shown the ability to quantitatively describe particle morphology with >85% accuracy from uranium oxide processing routes. In this study, we utilized VQ-VAE to analyze synthesized plutonium dioxide (PuO2) particles to investigate the underlying phenomena and predict its process parameters. The surface morphology of PuO2 powders calcined from plutonium oxalates precipitated under varying synthesis conditions related to concentrations, temperature, addition and digestion times, precipitant feed, and strike order was performed using SEM. A pipeline was developed to extract and quantify useful images of individual particles with VQ-VAE which was followed by further reduction of the dimensionality of the feature space using a bottlenecking neural network fit to perform multiple classification tasks simultaneously. The reduced feature space could predict process parameters for a single particle with >80% accuracy for some parameters. It also demonstrated potential in successfully grouping particles with similar surface morphology. The clustering and classification results revealed valuable information regarding the chemical process parameters that predominantly influence the PuO2 particle morphology, which includes strike order and oxalic acid feed stock, respectively. Repeating the analysis with multiple particles improved the classification accuracy of each process parameter compared to results yielded using single particle, with statistically significant results being yielded with as few as four particles.

AB Measurement signals and noise (heteroscedastic and homoscedastic) in different evolutionary spectral kinetic data sets are modeled and characterized by applying maximum likelihood common factor analysis (MLFA) and principal axis factoring (PAF), as factor-based techniques. They decompose data into common and specific factors, that are assumed to be constant heteroscedastic. The digital filter is also used for characterization of noise in data and to confirm the obtained results from factor analysis techniques. No one of the applied methods requires the use of replicated measurements. Inverted Blackman windowed sinc (BWS) smoothing coefficients as high-pass digital filters are employed to provide point and bin estimates of noise from measurement vectors without any assumption about noise structure. The proportionality of noise to signals and their characteristics are also reported and are comparable when applying different methods.The proposed methods are compared using both simulated and experimental kinetic data sets. Experimental data includes fluorescence and UV-vis absorbance kinetic spectra. A simple solution for problem of MLFA application to fat data is proposed and successfully applied. Different types of independent noise including identical independent distribution (iid), constant heteroscedastic, and general heteroscedastic are added to the simulated data, in various levels.In the case of iid noise results from all methods are almost the same. In the presence of heteroscedastic noise results from MLFA and PAF are preferred to PCA regarding subspace angles and discrepancy function values. Employment of methods for highly overlapped, skinny, and fat data shows the superiority of MLFA to PAF and PCA. The independent noise characteristics obtained from factor analysis methods are comparable to that from digital filters.

AB Prediction of phosphorus (P) content in manure using visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy is essential for better manure management. However, accurate prediction requires better spectra pre-processing, out of which spectra derivative is frequently used. This study presents the development of a non-integer order SavitzkyGolay derivative function (NISGDF) of vis-NIR spectra for the analysis of P composition in manure. A formula for a NISGDF is developed and presented in the form of a matrix. Next, both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using developed software packages, all of which can be easily called by a command line. Simulated absorption bands using the Gaussian model were operated by NISGDF to assess its abilities in reduction of noise and elimination of baseline and offset. A total of 110 pig manure samples were collected and scanned by a fibre type vis-NIR spectrophotometer in the range of 305-1700 nm. The collected manure spectra were subjected to the NISGDF, before they were used to establish the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model for P. Results indicate that the NISGDF offers significant flexibility in interpolating between the integer order SG derivatives, and reduces baseline offsets and tilts compared to conventional integer order SavitzkyGolay derivative function (ISGDF). The PLSR prediction accuracy with NISGDF was improved by 5-8%, compared with the corresponding PLSR model using the traditional ISGDF. This work shows that the NISGDF offers the advantage of wider applicability and better performance for the prediction of manure P, hence, it is recommended as a more general and better algorithm than the traditional ISGDF for the prediction of P.

AB Sensitivity and selectivity are arguably the two most important qualities in a new sensor design. While many spectroscopic sensors developed in laboratory conditions achieve high sensitivity and selectivity, they are not always applicable to real-world conditions. Challenges in real-world applications come from corruptions like noise and interference. This study leverages machine learning methods for accurate and robust quantification under such corruptions. We propose simple yet effective augmentation strategies that promote robustness against unknown interference. The performance of the proposed augmentations is compared under varying levels of interference and noise. We demonstrate our methodology for a gas sensing application using infrared spectroscopy data. We focus on quantifying common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a realistic scenario with several unknown interfering species. The findings of this work put us a step closer to creating a robust and widely-applicable sensing platform.Synopsis: Interference is a major obstacle in the development of reliable spectroscopic gas sensors. This study explores data augmentation strategies to tackle unknown interference and noise to propose a sensing strategy for volatile organic compounds.

AB Chemometrics and statistical ecology share interest in the analysis of multivariate data. In ecology, unconstrained and constrained ordination are popular methods to analyze and visualize multivariate data, with principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) as prototype methods. Constraints give more insight and power by focusing on the response of the variables to particular external predictors or experimental factors, after optional adjustment for covariates. In chemometrics, analysis of variance - simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) was proposed decades later, with particular emphasis on the multivariate main and interaction effects in factorial experiments. This paper shows the similarities and differences between ASCA, its extensions, and (partial) RDA, alias reduced-rank regression. ASCA and RDA (understood as a sequence of partial RDAs, just as ASCA uses a sequence of PCAs) are shown to be mathematically identical for equireplicated designed experiments. Differences appear with unequal replication. As a corollary we show that, with equal replication, a particularly attractive form of ASCA, which displays a main effect together with an interaction, is a special case of principal response curve analysis. RDA is a least-squares method and uses the optimal weights in the dimension reduction of the treatment effects, whereas ASCA extensions for unbalanced data use alternative, suboptimal weights.

AB The Sequential Multi-Block Partial Least Squares (SMB-PLS) model inversion is applied for defining analytically the multivariate raw material region providing assurance of quality with a certain confidence level for the critical to quality attributes (CQA). The SMB-PLS algorithm does identify the variation in process conditions uncorre-lated with raw material properties and known disturbances, which is crucial to implement an effective process control system attenuating most raw material variations. This allows expanding the specification region and, hence, one may potentially be able to accept lower cost raw materials that will yield products with perfectly satisfactory quality properties. The methodology can be used with historical/happenstance data, typical in In-dustry 4.0. This is illustrated using simulated data from an industrial case study.

ID ADAPTATION
AB Person re-identification is a challenging cross-camera matching problem, which is inherently subject to domain shift. To mitigate it, many solutions have been proposed so far, based on four kinds of approaches: supervised and unsupervised domain adaptation, direct transfer, and domain generalisation; in particular, the first two approaches require target data during system design, respectively labelled and unlabelled. In this work, we consider a very different approach, known as human-in-the-loopHITL), which consists of exploiting user's feedback on target data processed during system operation to improve re-identification accuracy. Although it seems particularly suited to this application, given the inherent interaction with a human operator, HITL methods have been proposed for person re-identification by only a few works so far, and with a different purpose than addressing domain shift. However, we argue that HITL deserves further consideration in person re-identification, also as a potential alternative solution against domain shift. To substantiate our view, we consider simple HITL implementations which do not require model re-training or fine-tuning: they are based on well-known relevance feedback algorithms for content-based image retrieval, and of novel versions of them we devise specifically for person re-identification. We then conduct an extensive, cross-data set experimental evaluation of our HITL implementations on benchmark data sets, and compare them with a large set of existing methods against domain shift, belonging to the four categories mentioned above. Our results provide evidence that HITL can be as effective as, or even outperform, existing ad hoc solutions against domain shift for person re-identification, even under the simple implementations we consider. We believe that these results can foster further research on HITL in the person re-identification field, where, in our opinion, its potential has not been thoroughly explored so far.

AB The effectiveness of natural language processing models relies on various factors, including the architecture, number of parameters, data used during training, and the tasks they were trained on. Recent studies indicate that models pre-trained on large corpora and fine-tuned on task-specific datasets, covering multiple tasks, can generate remarkable results across various benchmarks. We propose a new approach based on a straightforward hypothesis: improving model performance on a target task by considering other artificial tasks defined on the same training dataset. By doing so, the model can gain further insights into the training dataset and attain a greater understanding, improving efficiency on the target task. This approach differs from others that consider multiple pre-existing tasks on different datasets. We validate this hypothesis by focusing on the problem of answering yes/no questions and introducing a multi-task model that outputs a span of the reference text, serving as evidence for answering the question. The task of span extraction is an artificial one, designed to benefit the performance of the model answering yes/no questions. We acquire weak supervision for these spans, by using a pre-trained extractive question answering model, dispensing the need for costly human annotation. Our experiments, using modern transformer-based language models, demonstrate that this method outperforms the standard approach of training models to answer yes/no questions. Although the primary objective was to enhance the performance of the model in answering yes/no questions, it was discovered that span texts are a significant source of information. These spans, derived from the question reference texts, provided valuable insights for the users to better comprehend the answers to the questions. The model's improved accuracy in answering yes/no questions, coupled with the supplementary information provided by the span texts, led to a more comprehensive and informative user experience.

DE Collaborative filtering; Personalized recommendation; User interest;
   Embedding learning
AB The conventional uniform embeddings lack diversity to infer users' interests and make suboptimal recommendations for users. Fortunately, users' interactions imply a complex and hybrid composition of users' interests with multiple compatible intents. Therefore, this work strives to investigate fine-grained interest modeling from the diversified composition of interest with the intent hypothesis. We propose a cross-intent transformer embedding (CITE) for personalized recommendation, which extracts collaborative filtering (CF) signals by propagating interests within intent subgraphs and between compatible intents. In the scenario of interaction sparsity, intent-aware interest propagation employs graph convolution to ensure interest consistency in each intent subgraph. It builds intent-aware embeddings with interaction confidences learned iteratively on each intent subgraph. In addition, the transformer evaluates inter-intent compatibility to perform cross-intent interest propagation. It updates intent embeddings with CF signals between intents. The resulting multiple fine-grained intent embeddings model the hybrid composition of users' interests for personalized recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CITE and verify the active role of the compatible intents for interest modeling.

AB Identification of musical instruments is a vital problem in the area of Music Information Retrieval. Automatic music classification provides the foundation for a variety of advanced AI applications in the musical domain, such as automatic multi-instrument classification and information extraction from polyphonic audio. In this work, we construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to classify twenty different musical instrument classes. This work makes use of the Philharmonia dataset, which contains twenty classes of instruments belonging majorly to four instrument families: brass, woodwinds, percussion, and strings. We extract the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of the sounds and use them as the input representation for our model. Our work also exploits audio data augmentation techniques on a minority class of the highly imbalanced dataset. To ensure instrumentalist independence, instrument sounds belonging to 14 classes of instruments, that match those from the Philharmonia, are taken from the UIOWA MIS database. The model is trained and tested using this joint dataset. Using the CNN we obtain a new state-of-the-art accuracy.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to be a formidable instrument in managing Big Healthcare Data, and it has seen considerable success in bioinformatics. The advancement of big data in biological sciences has given rise to big data analytics (BDA) and artificial intelligence (AI). Because the AI methodologies used in bioinformatics are parallel and iterative, scalable big data management employing distributed and parallel technology is possible. The growth of bioinformatics has resulted in significant storage and administration issues; to share information, such large amounts of data must be handled efficiently. Computational developments in information technology have enabled analytical systems to cope with such data. Therefore, this study emphasizes the impact of big data and BDA in bioinformatics. A practical use of BDAs and AI in cancer classification was given, combining a unique Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) approach with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a hybrid feature selection to pick significant genes while minimizing gene redundancy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) were employed to classify the datasets. It is because microarray data are produced from gene expression data, and it frequently has a limited number of samples but a huge feature collection size. Using the same datasets, the suggested system outperformed earlier state-of-the-art approaches. The results of the proposed model on all the Leukemia, DLBCL, Colon, and SRDCT datasets revealed an average classification accuracy of 97.7%, 99.9%, 99.9% and 100%, respectively.

We propose a new technique for encoding sparsity in CCA by means of a mathematical programming formulation that allows one to obtain an exact solution using readily available solvers (such as Gurobi) or design solution algorithmic procedures based on it. Finally, we evaluate the performance of alternative solution strategies presented on multiple datasets from the literature. The results of the extensive comparison study highlight that the proposed approach is capable of finding the optimal correlation or finding good quality solutions, better than those provided by other conventional methods.

AB Large amounts of fMRI data are essential to building generalized predictive models for brain disease diagnosis. In order to conduct extensive data analysis, it is often necessary to gather data from multiple organizations. However, the site variation inherent in multisite resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) leads to unfavorable heterogeneity in data distribution, negatively impacting the identification of biomarkers and the diagnostic decision. Several existing methods have alleviated this shift of domain distribution (i.e., multisite problem). Statistical tuning schemes directly regress out site disparity factors from the data prior to model training. Such methods have a limitation in processing data each time through variance estimation according to the added site. In the model adjustment approaches, domain adaptation (DA) methods adjust the features or models of the source domain according to the target domain during model training. Thus, it is inevitable that it needs updating model parameters according to the samples of a target site, causing great limitations in practical applicability. Meanwhile, the approach of domain generalization (DG) aims to create a universal model that can be quickly adapted to multiple domains. In this study, we propose a novel framework for disease diagnosis that alleviates the multisite problem by adaptively calibrating site-specific features into site-invariant features. Specifically, it applies directly to samples from unseen sites without the need for fine-tuning. With a learning-to-learn strategy that learns how to calibrate the features under the various domain shift environments, our novel modulation mechanism extracts site-invariant features. In our experiments over the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE I and II) dataset, we validated the generalization ability of the proposed network by improving diagnostic accuracy in both seen and unseen multisite samples.

TI Multi-view Outlier Detection via Graphs Denoising
SO INFORMATION FUSION

DT Article

AB Recently, multi-view outlier detection attracts increasingly more attention. Although existing multi-view outlier detection methods have demonstrated promising performance, they still suffer from some problems. Firstly, many methods make the assumption that the data have a clear clustering structure and detect the outliers by using some off-the-shelf clustering methods. Therefore, the performance of these methods depends on the clustering methods they used, and thus these methods are hard to handle complicated data. Secondly, some methods ignore the complicated structure or distribution of class outliers and directly learn a consensus representation by simply combining the representation of different views linearly. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel method named Multi-view Outlier Detection with Graph Denoising (MODGD). We first construct a graph for each view, and then learn a consensus graph by ensembling the multiple graphs. When fusing the multiple graphs, we explicitly characterize and extract the structured outliers on each graph and recover the multiple clean graphs for the ensemble. During the process of multiple graph denoising and fusion, we carefully design an outlier measurement criterion based on the characteristics of attribute and class outliers. The extensive experiments on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. The codes of this paper are released in http://Doctor-Nobody.github.io/codes/MODGD.zip.
